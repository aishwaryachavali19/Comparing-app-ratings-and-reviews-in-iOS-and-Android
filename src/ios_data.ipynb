One of my best friends to this day I would‚Äôve never thought of talking to if it hadn‚Äôt been for houseparty. It‚Äôs a great app overall the only reason it lost that star was because of what it did with streaks. It started off cool like you and your friends would try to rack up minutes and because it was every five days in circumstances where they couldn‚Äôt be on house party I felt it was a good amount of time to give. But then they began decreasing it to three and then two days which means you basically have to be on the app everyday in order to keep your minutes or streak or whatever. It‚Äôs not really the fact that minutes and aesthetic were lost but more of the passive aggressive way to keep people on the app. Minutes were one out of many of my motivations to go back to the app knowing i had a good amount of time, but now there‚Äôs no motivation if you‚Äôre just going to lose them every two days. But overall it is still a very good app and helpful in making new friends',\n",

You can message your friends through the app, which I find very convenient. Speaking of friends, on the app somebody has to request to be your friend, so thistles the app slightly more private then it already is. The quality of the video is very good. Houseparty has the same qualities as the app ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù and more. You can play games with your friend that the app serves to you while on a call with your friend. You can make group conversations on the messaging part of the app. And to wrap it up, you can call other friends that are on the app, from the app, and you can also just do an audio call. There are many more great things about housparty that I can‚Äôt fit into one review. So I definitely recommend this app for any age group. (It is not at all inappropriate or to mature for anyone that is able to use ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù or ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù). The app is very accommodating!!! And awesome!!',\n",

For example my Houseparty and my friends Houseparty on the MacBook is really bad, for one of my friends so bad that she can‚Äôt even open it. Another thing it‚Äôs not even an app that you can download on the App Store it‚Äôs a link that you can send to your email, but the thing is what happens if you don‚Äôt have an email, you have to think about these things because some people in Houseparty are little and they just want to talk to their friends. Also there is no way to log out on your Mac to switch to other accounts and on top of that you can‚Äôt invite anyone to rooms, receive messages, and send messages. These are all the things I ask to make it better. \\n\\nPs: my friend also sent a review for filters and you said they were gonna come out soon but I still see no sight of that.',\n",

Notifications. The notifications settings in the app are very limited. I get a notification every time a new Facebook friend joins the app. It‚Äôs extremely annoying. I‚Äôm probably going into my iPhone settings and completely disable notifications for the app entirely until the fix it. 2) the app isn‚Äôt intuitive and user friendly.

It‚Äôs a feature none of us use (why would we be going in and out of chats like that?) And if you guys could tone it down with the amount of notifications this app produces, that would be great.

I love it, FaceTime has given me issues in the past year because of Group FaceTime. It wouldn‚Äôt let me and my friends be on it. But then we found HouseParty and we absolutely loved it. There is a little bug though. Every time we try to get in a call or something it kicks one of us out, and it stops HouseParty. But maybe that‚Äôs just us? Well other than that HouseParty is super amazing and if you fix the bug I‚Äôll be happy from night and day. But anyways I‚Äôve had HouseParty for over a a year and I definitely recommend this app because it‚Äôs definitely suitable for all ages who‚Äôs re aloud to talk to the friends on any electronic!',\n",

One of my best friends to this day I would‚Äôve never thought of talking to if it hadn‚Äôt been for houseparty. It‚Äôs a great app overall the only reason it lost that star was because of what it did with streaks. It started off cool like you and your friends would try to rack up minutes and because it was every five days in circumstances where they couldn‚Äôt be on house party I felt it was a good amount of time to give. But then they began decreasing it to three and then two days which means you basically have to be on the app everyday in order to keep your minutes or streak or whatever. It‚Äôs not really the fact that minutes and aesthetic were lost but more of the passive aggressive way to keep people on the app. Minutes were one out of many of my motivations to go back to the app knowing i had a good amount of time, but now there‚Äôs no motivation if you‚Äôre just going to lose them every two days.

       " 'text': \"I am literally writing this after this app crashed while I was using it. I don't even know where I should start. After the update with the new look of the app everything just went terribly wrong. First off, the bugs. I keep restarting this app dozens of times a day in order for it to work properly. Messages won't load, there are bugs with the media overall, especially videos that don't play properly most of the time and how low quality they are. I am pretty sure that there's no problem with my phone nor with my internet connection, because everything else on my phone works perfectly fine. Let's not mention how late my messages are. This happens every day: I send a dozen messages and neither of those are appearing on my screen and I have to wait up a bit until they're sent. And the pen - it's just horrible. I saw that now I can change the thickness of it, but it is terrible anyway - the previous version of it was undoubtely better. I saw people talking about how new updates removed everything that made Messenger unique and the reasons why people still used it even though apps such as WhatsApp and Viber are more popular nowadays. I remember when Messenger used to be my favorite app for chatting. I've been using it for past 5 years on a daily basis. It is hard to find another platform where I can text with my friends because we got so used to this app. PLEASE FIX THE BUGS if not anything else.\",\n",
