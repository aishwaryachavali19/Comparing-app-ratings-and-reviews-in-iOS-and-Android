0	454638411	social	1	I am literally writing this after this app crashed while I was using it. I don't even know where I should start. After the update with the new look of the app everything just went terribly wrong. First off, the bugs. I keep restarting this app dozens of times a day in order for it to work properly. Messages won't load, there are bugs with the media overall, especially videos that don't play properly most of the time and how low quality they are. I am pretty sure that there's no problem with my phone nor with my internet connection, because everything else on my phone works perfectly fine. Let's not mention how late my messages are. This happens every day: I send a dozen messages and neither of those are appearing on my screen and I have to wait up a bit until they're sent. And the pen - it's just horrible. I saw that now I can change the thickness of it, but it is terrible anyway - the previous version of it was undoubtely better. I saw people talking about how new updates removed everything that made Messenger unique and the reasons why people still used it even though apps such as WhatsApp and Viber are more popular nowadays. I remember when Messenger used to be my favorite app for chatting. I've been using it for past 5 years on a daily basis. It is hard to find another platform where I can text with my friends because we got so used to this app. PLEASE FIX THE BUGS if not anything else.	positive
1	454638411	social	2	Soooo, no matter what, this app can‚Äôt be bypassed in order to communicate with others on FB. A change i personally was not pleased about but whatever. Then as it progressed it elevated to be more appeasing by incorporating fun and entertaining elements such as color and name change, pushing the send till it blew up larger, having games that can be played with others, etc.... it‚Äôs confusing why such things that made it stand apart from other apps would be taken away. Was the plan to make messenger extremely basic to allow for other apps to have a chance?! See... not everyone has an IPhone where you can play games through text messaging and not everyone wants to have a million games downloaded on their phone taking up space. Therefore, speaking for this specifically allowed for anyone with messenger to not only message but engage in other ways also with no cellphone type barrier. If nothing else... games and other things that enhance communication and engagement is what i personally would enjoy incorporated and/or being brought back. Having different options to explore regardless of the type of phone you have bridges that gap and can help bring people together in more ways other than just dialogue. Just saying	positive
2	454638411	social	1	"Well did an update on Tuesday, & it hasn‚Äôt worked the same since, every time I want to send a picture or attachment it crashes, & closes itself out!! Can‚Äôt you peeps use things yourself, see if they work before putting the updates out there??  Whole iPhone has greatly slowed down since last update! üò≥üò§. Of course we all know why!!?? üò°.  This update, removed the ‚Äúblow up‚Äù emoticons that get bigger while holding them down, seeing wether or not others had read your post without having to actually open it. The slide to type no longer works, some of my games won‚Äôt work, can‚Äôt get to all of my stickers they just vanished, but are on my iPhone.  I don‚Äôt want a business type app, this was meant originally to allow people to connect without the hassle, no ads or junk, now we have everything (all junk) Put all the extras on an app by itself, name it something different, and put this the way it was. I think you have trashed the things I liked about the app, and kept the junk. I guess I‚Äôll find another message app. If I would have thought I should have read the reviews first this time, and just not upgraded, because it didn‚Äôt upgrade, it downgraded.
I hope you read this. As I‚Äôm gonna see how right my review is, by reading everyone else‚Äôs!"	positive
3	454638411	social	1	"The new update is absolutely disgusting. It makes this app not only visibly unappealing, but the new UI is hard to use, foolhardy, and removes many useful features. I also keep having problems with crashing. The new online/offline status is buggy and gets stuck. Phone calls are buggy too and stopped displaying properly. Messages can no longer be easily copied, deleted or forwarded. The old menu was easier. I preferred the swipe reply feature. Messages are no longer easy to reply to in notifications either. Pictures are not easy to send.
I used to like this app because of the little unique things like the old cute reactions, chat colors, and balloons and hearts that you could catch. Now, they are all gone. I used to love using stickers, but the system is all messed up now as your most recent stickers and the packs are harder to find. I do not like the excess spacing between packs either. I am not exaggerating to say that I hate this new update. I have recommended that people do not update if they still have an older version. Many of my friends have agreed with me and say that this new version glitchy, problematic, and ugly. I have stopped using it as much because it is useless now. What did you do to this app?"	negative
4	454638411	social	3	I don‚Äôt do reviews at all but messenger for the longest I‚Äôve used it to text and chat with people for some reason it‚Äôs giving me and my friend a problem we always chat online since we‚Äôre so far apart anyway last time there was a problem was notification whenever I text and leave the app she she texts me back I wouldn‚Äôt even get it at all till I get worried and I see she sends one but my notification didn‚Äôt even tell me which was crazy it drove me crazy so I uninstalled the app and downloaded it (we both did) but it didn‚Äôt seem to work but since the last update (forgot which one) it seemed to be fixed and when it came to this update (I think this month don‚Äôt remember) the app been acting weird my friend would text me and once i got on the app and leave (maybe an hour) it would say I send at the time I go back and my friend would say ‚Äúonce she goes back to the app to check up on me it will show I just send right after she gets on the app‚Äù it was really crazy for the both of us I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the app or us we tried figuring it so I‚Äôm not sure (idk how to explain it...)	negative
5	454638411	social	3	"There needs to be a better notification when someone you‚Äôre not friends with messages you. Message requests are banished to an unintuitive corner of the screen where they are too easily overlooked. This is a huge problem for networking and connecting with members of your groups.
Lately when I‚Äôve been opening conversation threads on the app, I find the text from the last message I sent duplicated in the composition bubble. The message was sent, but the app copied and kept the text. Just annoying.
When communicating with marketplace buyers, the thread is always labeled with my name first and then the product. This is really confusing, especially when I‚Äôve responded to more than one listing. I open the app and it‚Äôs just lines of my name. Makes it hard to distinguish between conversations. Please alter it so that I can see the name of the person I‚Äôm talking to- or no name at all, just the item description.
Otherwise, rare glitches and good phone quality. I use this app constantly and it is very reliable, kept up to date, and is worth having."	neutral
6	454638411	social	1	Facebook and messenger are always changing. The new messenger updates are less than desirable. For some unknown reason when I have a message from marketplace and delete it, it still keeps the marketplace folder in my chats, even though there are no messages in it. Before, when you‚Äôd delete all the marketplace messages, the folder would also disappear from your chat list. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to make it go away. Then it happened again today, except now it not only is keeping the folder in my chats, it‚Äôs saying there‚Äôs still an unread message in it when there are zero messages in the folder. Seems minor, but I like my chats cleaned up, so the fact that it no longer goes away is rather annoying. Also, could we stop constantly changing where ‚Äúspam/other/message requests‚Äù go? Why can‚Äôt you just make it a more accessible option and leave it? We shouldn‚Äôt have to go hunt for the folder and this last update completely moved where they are found, to the point that initially I thought message requests were just going to be a thing of the past. Rarely are the updates good, and it‚Äôs clear others agree. Unfortunate!	negative
7	454638411	social	1	The title seems harsh, but you need to know how bad this update is. It‚Äôs annoying that the texting screen has to be full screen the whole time, and I also hate that you stopped including the cool things with emojis. My friend and I liked sending the balloon emoji, and it would send balloons all over the screen. With my mom, I‚Äôd send a heart and make it really big. Both of those features are removed now, because you want the app to be easier for ‚Äúbusiness purposes?‚Äù Seriously? It was never meant for that, and, let‚Äôs be honest, most people would use Messages anyway. The majority of people on the app just want to enjoy the app by texting their friends and family, and now you got rid of things that made the app unique. I really liked Messenger, but you had to waste it by updating like this. Please, please just leave it how it was. I would talk about some other more ‚Äúimportant‚Äù issues, but there are other reviews too, like how you have to have a phone number now to text. I don‚Äôt know how this update can help. I sound rude here, but I want you to take the time to read my review and consider what I said. Thanks for reading.	positive
8	454638411	social	1	Cmon people. Seriously stop with the completely unnecessary changes. You did not have to change the bubble where you could see if the person viewed your message or not without opening the chat. Also I want to see if the message has sent or not without opening the chat also. I don‚Äôt want to have to open the chat and check every individual person to see these things. Not to mention the way you send photos is so annoying now, before it was much easier. Also, it‚Äôs annoying how to press copy and remove message. You guys did not make any changes that helped me in any way and it‚Äôs frustrating and longer especially the way the stickers are set up. Whoever designs these things, should be fired. I prefer the version from many months ago, where I could find the games and so forth. You all need to stop making stupid updates when there is literally no need to make anyone‚Äôs life more complicated. No one likes it, especially all the people I talk to.  Messenger keeps getting worse and worse every single update. I wish I could go back to a year ago, because that was the best version.	negative
9	454638411	social	3	I feel as if that app deserved 3 stars from using it a few days. I‚Äôve had it on other phone but I just recently started using it again on this one. I gave it a 3 because there is no option to voice chat with more than 1 person. I feel as if the time is getting near that this app should have that feature to out do competitors. Discord has a voice chat that allows more than 1 person to join and I think that they are below this app. Please add that feature. If you do, I will be willing to give it a 5 star rating. I like that you can have a group text chat but voice allowing multiple people is better for those who want to have prayer with more than one person. If you are a developer reading this, please respond to me  to let me know you were interested in my feedback and please recommend to your higher up. Please reassure him I am willing to give this app a 5 star rating if they add a voice chat that allows multiple people to join.  Bless all who read these words.	positive
10	454638411	social	1	"Honestly a lot of the features being removed I get. Especially with the app being rebuilt from the ground up.

Within the last day or so going into any conversation *instead of just one from a recent bug report* I will be kicked out back to the conversation selection screen with the animation like I swiped to go back there myself but I didn‚Äôt. And even if I‚Äôm in the middle of typing it can happen to. On top of whatever was being typed being gone when *trying* to go back to the conversation. Also when it force backs you out some reason all the conversations flash out of existence for a few seconds. I was going to say maybe it was just my phone. I restarted my phone and uninstalled and reinstalled and even cleared app data to no avail. But it also happens on my IPhone SE which is on the latest 13.4.1 update like my 11 Pro max right now. So I pretty much can‚Äôt reliably use messenger now on any of my phones and have to go to a laptop. I‚Äôm also very confused as to the fact this just started happening today. And not the day of the update ü§î"	positive
11	454638411	social	5	I can‚Äôt believe you finally removed all the trash that was bloating this app ,now finally the app looks like a messaging app which how it should‚Äôve looked since the beginning, unfortunately as cool as the app looks right now I think this change has came in too late ,well for me at least because I don‚Äôt recall the last time I actually used messenger to message someone and every person I know has move away to using other apps that provided a better and cleaner experience that what messenger used to offer for the past years ,now I‚Äôm not hating here no in fact i hope people get back to using it because it‚Äôs just more convenient than other apps especially now that it‚Äôs simple and clean but I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs kinda late and I‚Äôm afraid people have gotten used to the other apps but we‚Äôll see about that...	positive
12	454638411	social	1	They have changed a few things on this latest update and it feels like a step backwards in my opinion. First off... when my friends and I share location you can no longer see the their location without having to click on the map, then zooming in a lot farther than you ever should have to. And most of the time that location is not even correct. Secondly you can no longer see if the other person has seen your message without opening conversation (which was very useful). Also the new emojis for reacting to pictures are not good and they need to be changed back to the ones prior to the update. In the previous version you could click on stickers that were sent to you and the pack that it came from would show up and you could use them if you wanted to... now you can still click on them but all it does is show you the pack and you cannot use them. You have to go back to stickers and find that pack to use them. This new update is not at all user friendly and Facebook needs to go back to previous version.	positive
13	454638411	social	1	The new update has my app logging my account out repeatedly and will therefore not give me notifications that I‚Äôm receiving messages and calls from people. I‚Äôll be using the app, close my phone to do something, and not even 5 minutes later open it up and see that I‚Äôve been logged out. Ridiculous. Also, the emoji reactions to messages were so much more expressive than before. I‚Äôve always felt that the point of them was to communicate an emotion, and I don‚Äôt think the updated symbols reflect that. Also, why take out the ‚Äúrecent‚Äù section for the stickers? It was such a useful function and now I have to sift through so many packs to find the sticker I‚Äôm looking for that would‚Äôve just been in my recents if I still had one. Furthermore, the section that you have to slide to choose between the two sticker packs is so low on the screen that more often than not, I end up swiping the app to the left and exiting, so I have to reopen the app. It was much nicer when it was higher up and out of the way of that danger zone.	negative
14	454638411	social	1	"For the past month, I haven‚Äôt been able to log into my account on Messenger. I‚Äôve reported the problem twice through Facebook with no feedback. When I try to login, it says, ‚ÄúUnable to login. Please try again later.‚Äù I‚Äôve tried using ‚ÄúForgot Password,‚Äù but it glitches and won‚Äôt let me continue. I have tried every login and password combination I have had in the past as well as what the current login should be and can‚Äôt get in! When I use Facebook through my Chromebook I can view messages that way, but it‚Äôs very inconvenient since my laptop is outdated and barely functions. Nothing looks suspicious, so I don‚Äôt believe my account has been compromised. I also can‚Äôt view messages through a mobile browser as it just directs me back to the login screen for the app.

 I need to be able to get in through my phone, but no word back from the Facebook team. I‚Äôve updated regularly, and checked the FAQs which don‚Äôt provide any useful info. I hope the Facebook team will look into this, otherwise I‚Äôll have to drop Messenger, which I really don‚Äôt want to do."	positive
15	454638411	social	1	üò°üò§ I absolutely hate this new version of messenger.   I can‚Äôt tell when anyone is active or how long since they‚Äôve been active.  I liked the other version much better with the little bubble pic beside their name with the green dot or time since they was active.   I hate that I can‚Äôt see if they‚Äôve seen the msg or not.  Unless I open up the conversation.  Also before this last update. It showed the time someone seen my msg. Now just shows seen.  An however many hours ago.   That don‚Äôt give me a time.  I liked the fact it showed the exact time it was opened an read.  Just leave things alone!!!! It was working great before.  Now I can‚Äôt see anything.  Smh.  If I could‚Äôve gave it anything lower than one star I would have.  I hate it now.   ü§¨ it‚Äôs horrible with this latest version.  I can‚Äôt tell when anyone is active anymore.  It‚Äôs stupid an pointless.  I want the previous version back.  Idk why when something is working fine. It has to be completely messed up.  Who comes up with these stupid updates?   Put it back the way it was before this last update.!!!!	negative
16	454638411	social	1	"What a dumpster fire of an app. I‚Äôve always had problems with messenger, but they‚Äôve often been minor and have sometimes been resolved. It‚Äôs ridiculous how long it took to get more (but still not all) emojis available as emoji buttons for chats, but they eventually added this inconsequential feature. It would be nice if they expanded the color/theme options, but I can live without that. 

Recently, though, things have just gotten worse. The removal of polls in group chats is ridiculous. There‚Äôs no reason for such a feature to be taken away. Facebook has been ‚Äúworking to add them back‚Äù for months now. Additionally, my main issue with the app is that I‚Äôm now completely unable to make new group messages. This has happened once before, and I had to delete and reinstall the app to fix the problem. I should never have to do that, but at least it worked. The problem has resurfaced now, though, and even deleting and reinstalling hasn‚Äôt solved the problem. I guess the app is just permanently broken for me? Good on you, Facebook. 

What a waste."	negative
17	454638411	social	1	"Most of the people I‚Äôve seen have just been complaining so I‚Äôm going to try and make this review at least a little helpful. This new update has so much wasted space. Just yesterday the formatting was pretty much perfect from a design standpoint, but now there is so much unused white space at the top of the screen. Even just the word ‚ÄúChats‚Äù takes up so much unnecessary space which previously encompassed everything that wasn‚Äôt actual chats (like stories and your profile info. The previous design was perfectly fine and there was no need to change it, and changing your design completely won‚Äôt make a significant number of people suddenly decide to download the app. If nothing else, give everyone the option to go back to the previous version.
As a lover of web design, I know white space can be useful, but it can be extremely harmful if there is too much unused space, and that is exactly what happened. You messed up with this one, but there‚Äôs still an opportunity to fix it, or at least canter to those who know this is bad design."	positive
18	454638411	social	2	Hello how is everyone doing?  I‚Äôm wondering why messenger isn‚Äôt up to date with everyone else. I‚Äôm sure others have the same thoughts, A lot of individuals use this service to call and message others along with maps people send others when they are trying to meet and for products and merchandise just for an example. Why can we not have this app sync with our vehicles like the phone and messages app that Apple have in place. This would be a very nice update to an increasingly popular app. Not only that, but it would make us, yes even yourselves safer on the road. After all isn‚Äôt that what we all strive for, I know your users strive for this on a daily basis. Please if you would, look into this. I for one drive a very huge truck 2016 F350 dually FX 4 lifted & oversized tires for work purposes. I am a safety officer so I especially know safety is of the utmost concern no matter what we do as a society. I for one love my Sync3 system and would love to be able to use it to keep us all a little safer.	positive
19	454638411	social	2	Facebooks messenger app is a pointless application‚Äîeveryone already has free text messaging and pays for cell phone service, so why create a new application (for things like virtual yard sale) and ask for permissions to text and call?  I find it absolutely absurd that I have to download an app to view messages from a web based platform.  (No I DO NOT have the FB app, thank you.). Not only that but the two rarely communicate efficiently.  After you check messages in the app, FB profile will still show a messages notification.  On top of that every time you use it asks for notifications to be turned on (why? When FB should be notifying you?) and asking for permission for microphone and camera.  The app drains battery power when you do have notifications turned on especially in group chats‚Äîpinging every time there is a new comment. I‚Äôm not sure what a good use for this app is‚Äîit should be reintegrated back into Facebook and allow users to check messages from the web based platform.	positive
20	454638411	social	3	Although I have connected with some amazing people through this app and love the fact that I can connect with people all over the world this app is not a dating app and people need to be respectful of that.  I‚Äôm not on messenger to hook up with people and receive numerous messages and random calls from people during all times of the day and night.  I do understand I can shut my phone off or use my sleep setting on my phone but have had a parent experiencing some health issues and don‚Äôt want to shut my phone down as I may need to take a call or message at anytime.  The other thing I don‚Äôt like is that people know the second I connect to Facebook or messenger and become active on the sight.  Sometimes I just jump on to check something out for business purposes and get bombarded with messages.  It would be nice to have the ability to get online without the world knowing I‚Äôm there.	positive
21	454638411	social	3	"I don't normally leave reviews, but i feel that i have to in this case. 

I don't really have any problems with Messenger itself, being what it is; however, there are a few things that I need to gripe about: 1) foremost is the fact that it is a whole separate app from Facebook. You have to have both in almost every single case. I remember that you used to be able to utilize the Messenger function in the Facebook app without the need for the second application.

2) the most annoying thing about the Messenger app is the ""friendversary."" It's just an attempt to make the app seem relevant. I have pretty much every function of the Messenger app turned off aside from Notifications because I have a couple of people that only send things through Messenger. I seriously wish that the stupid ""friendversary"" crap could be turned off as it goes off randomly and the sound is quite loud and distracting."	negative
22	454638411	social	3	Compared to previous versions of the app this is by far the best one but personally I think it would definitely be much better if a few things were changed on it. Even just the smallest changes could make it way better. Simplicity is key always. With this being said I think by making the main messenger screen less complex and having it to where you can go in the app and out quicker could have a great affect on everything including the ratings. Meaning having the Messenger App uncomplicated and more straight forward I know I would personally be happier with it and use it daily and as well as a good amount of individuals I know. For example if someone could get on message a friend & respond right back; almost compared to AIM or slightly like iMessage. It would change the game completely and have a higher rating guaranteed. Only asking to take it into consideration. :)	positive
23	454638411	social	2	"I recently updated my messenger and it‚Äôs weird because I have two Facebook accounts and I can only  see the update on one account when I switch to the other account I can‚Äôt see the update, it‚Äôs in the older version.
I don‚Äôt know if it makes a difference but the one account that does have the update is also open on another device I use (iphone6s) and it shows it‚Äôs updated
and the one that isn‚Äôt updated I only have it in this iPhone XS device. I already reset all settings, deleted Facebook and Messenger Installed then back logged out of accounts and just finished Factory Data Reset. Nothing works I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on. It bother me because on the newer update seems to be more simple and basic than the older version. Same goes with instagram both accounts issue. I don‚Äôt auto update my apps on my iPhone XS but iPhone 6s I do . I‚Äôm not sure if that would be the issue however i still complete the updates ... hopefully I get answers from this."	negative
24	454638411	social	1	I‚Äôve just updated the apps in few minutes ago and I thought they‚Äôre going to improve the apps but no. Whenever a notification pops out and I clicked it to reply on the apps, it just forced to close. I can‚Äôt even click on the messenger icon on the right top of Facebook because it‚Äôll force to close the apps. I like to use messenger because I don‚Äôt have to backup my messages as it‚Äôll be stored online and even when my phone is charging, I can still chat with my friend by using laptop. However, I can‚Äôt type really fast and it‚Äôll lag and I have to double check and correct my message sometimes. And, I hope that this apps can add a search history function in mobile phone version, because sometimes I want to check the first message that I chat with my friend and I couldn‚Äôt do this as I have to manually scroll back to the message which texted in few years ago. Imagine how long should I scroll back while me and my friend texting to each other almost everyday from day to night.	positive
25	454638411	social	3	Always been a big loyal fan of Facebook‚Äôs Messenger app and to this day it is still my go-to method of communication versus texting with my personal cell number. However, after the iOS 11.0.3 update messenger has a huge lag when it comes to sending pictures, and even messages at all for that matter. I thought it was the pictures themselves or the WiFi connection but it happens with any picture or video I try to send, no matter what size, and no matter the WiFi signal strength or network I‚Äôm connected to. At times the app will even crash right when opening it for the first time on any given day, no matter how often I clear background apps and history and data on my iTouch. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs Apple‚Äôs or Facebook‚Äôs issue but the compatibility and functionality should be pristine and on point, considering how much we pay for our devices and how often software is updated.	positive
26	454638411	social	1	"I no longer receive Messenger alerts or messages from FB marketplace replies; that used to automatically go to the Messenger chat for privacy, vs through FB. There have been no settings changes, as all my apps are automatically updated however I have gone into all relevant Apps, made sure all is as should be. Nothing had been altered. 
A reply now shows up in my emails, naming the person replying that I‚Äôm supposed to be in conversation with via Marketplace. It takes me to ‚Äúopen in Messenger‚Äù, then ‚ÄúWould you like to open in Messenger‚Äù, then to the Messenger App Store, which then when opened, takes me back into Messenger that again shows no Marketplace message. A total futile cycle. 
All messages through my contacts are fine, and as I‚Äôve said, all my Messenger settings are in tact, as I went through everything in detail. There are no issues at all with FB or my emails. 
I have no idea what has changed, but it is very frustrating, as I use FB Marketplace frequently.
Whether I‚Äôm the seller or the buyer, it is not a good reflection on me."	negative
27	454638411	social	4	I‚Äôm not trying to write a bad review or anything but... Can y‚Äôall update this app by telling us our emails in the settings. Because had an Messenger account and then I had forgot the password word. Then, I had to make a new one but I couldn‚Äôt use my regular phone email so I had to come up with another one because it was an account (my old account) that was already use. But now I had my Phone number changed and now I can‚Äôt log into my account. Because my account is not set up on this phone number but on my old one. SO CAN Y‚ÄôALL ALSO let us have an option to change our phone number on there ??? And I don‚Äôt have Facebook account I only have an Messenger so I can‚Äôt log in with the Facebook login.

28	454638411	social	1	"Useful and fun features were unnecessarily removed for this new update. Reading other reviews, clearly nobody is happy with this change. This isn‚Äôt a matter of not wanting to see the app change and grow.. features I used every day are now gone for no reason. App features that need to come back immediately:
-Timestamped read receipts
-The profile picture bubble indicating that your message was read without having to open the chat
-Emoji reacts (the heart can stay, but the heart eyes need to come back)
-Filters, stickers, and emojis on photos you edit within the app. And preferably ADD more stickers that can be placed on photos. The hats and mustaches and goofy eyes are fun!
-Speaking of editing photos, options for editing text onto a photo were removed. Sometimes I want a background behind the text or to choose a different font, where did that go?
-Searching for gifs does not need the take up the entire screen. I want to be able to read incoming messages within the chat while I look for gifs. 

I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs more that I can‚Äôt think of at the moment as well. Read other reviews; there are many other complaints. I‚Äôm sure there was a reason for updating the app, but with so many people unhappy with useful features removed, there‚Äôs now more of a reason to bring those features back. Otherwise, many people will stop using the app. We want it to be fun, most people don‚Äôt use it for business!!"	positive
29	454638411	social	3	"I‚Äôm not sure if these are happening while Messenger is between updates, but I prefer the ‚Äúheart eyes‚Äù react to the new ‚Äúheart symbol‚Äù react. Also, chat emojis can no longer be held down to get their two larger sizes? I hope this is something that returns soon, because all my friends and I have been really disappointed to lose this. I also noticed that now when I click on someone in a group chat, I don‚Äôt have the option to send them a direct message. I can go to their profile and message them or I can just go search their name and message them, but I liked the see less transition from before. 
I still prefer FB messenger to some other meds engine apps, though. Please always keep the fun char colors, chat emojis, and multiple react options. It‚Äôs fun and adds visual variety to chats with different people/different groups, and it‚Äôs a cool way to personalize different relationships."	positive
30	454638411	social	1	All of my messages from the past hour have been deleted. The chat color changes sporadically. One day it‚Äôs blue. The next day it‚Äôs back to the gradient hue. And then back again. Nicknames get deleted, mixed up from other groups I‚Äôm in, and then goes back to the persons regular name. I can‚Äôt see if my friends have read my messages, I can‚Äôt see whose online, and I can‚Äôt send new messages to people. Sometimes this works?? And then disappears again.  The cute chat feature that I use with my boyfriend where the emoji blows up to a bigger size, no longer works. I can‚Äôt send stickers, and I can‚Äôt use any other apps while in a call or the call drops. My boyfriend and I are in a long distance relationship and it‚Äôs our primary source of texting, calling, video chat, and now it barely works. What happened?? The app goes from functional for a few hours, I close it out, then everything is gone. I‚Äôve turned off my phone, closed out the app, and even deleted it and reinstalled and nothing has changed. I‚Äôm so sad.	negative
31	454638411	social	3	"I love messenger and how you can connect with your friends and family etc. However I‚Äôm not too fond with this new update because it‚Äôs easier to tell if someone has read your message by seeing their bubble next to your message, unfortunately that feature is removed :(. I also miss whenever I would go to look at pictures it was easier just to scroll down and see the pictures exchanged instead of going through the option ‚ÄúView Photos & Videos‚Äù it just looks kinda bland. Last but not least please change it back or at least improve it üòÅ including the ‚Äúsearch messages option‚Äù like make it to where we can the dates these messages were sent so there would be no confusion. Thanks!

Update: Please bring back the old features such as reminders and pills and the fun blow up emojis, the games and things that would make it look fun not bland!"	positive
32	454638411	social	1	I got phished using this and went through hell to make sure everything in my life was safe. It should be an option to have messenger or to keep messages on your Facebook!!!!!!!! You are forcing ppl to use this app when anyone from anywhere can send you something and can hack right into your Facebook account get your information and use it to their benefit, Putting all of your friends at risk for going through the same thing. I have emailed you, went to the security only to be told we are working on it. Don‚Äôt lie. You are not ‚Äò working on it‚Äô you have no desire to ‚Äò work on it‚Äô. These phished got my phone number, email, etc. now they‚Äôve moved onto my friends. There is nothing safe with this app. You could have a separate password, or a number of other things to secure an account that is built on ruining your life of the ppl who get into your Facebook account and can use it against you. MAKE IT AN OPTION, NOT A ‚Äò YOU HAVETo HAVe THIS TO Communicate with YOUR FRIENDS!!!!!!	positive
33	454638411	social	5	"Facebook messenger is seriously lacking behind with simple and small functions that can make it great. 
Facebook has friends that we do not want to share our phone numbers with to be able to communicate on other great and easy to converse instant messaging apps. 
One of those function is to be able to reply directly to a particular message. 
So difficult to handle conversation on Facebook as it doesn‚Äôt allow for different topics to be discussed concurrently just with a reply functionality. 
Most times when you go back to an old discussion during a new one the whole thing becomes confusing and then takes longer to type and clarify things with who you are chatting with. 
I can have a discussion in 3 mins on other apps and that same conversation would take me 10 mins on Facebook messenger. 
This is because you talk about one topic finish it up properly and start the next one again.
When you can talk about both same time just directly replying to the exact thing you getting back at. 
Please fix this because it‚Äôs getting boring chatting on Facebook messenger.
If you can smile to a message thumb up and other things why can‚Äôt we reply?
Thank you."	positive
34	454638411	social	1	"This new update changes how video calls look when you don't have them fullscreen. This just used to be a smaller version of the fullscreen view, but now it gives equal size to you and the person you're calling. This also makes it so that you can only see a square of what you are showing your friend, and you can only see a square of what your friend is showing you, which is very annoying. You can't see as much as you can in fullscreen (the old non-fullscreen version still allowed you to see everything).
Also, when you send hearts in Messenger, you used to be able to grab and pull the little hearts that float up, but now you can't do that. This is a small thing, but it was something that my boyfriend and I really enjoyed about the app, and I am very sad that this feature is gone. 
Also, a long time ago on the iOS version, most of the Emojis had a messenger version (which I much prefer to Apple's styles). I don't know why these designs went away on iOS, but I want them back."	positive
35	454638411	social	1	"I have had no problem with messenger, until recently. 
Recently (the past few weeks) every time I log onto messenger I get a banner above my messages saying I have 100+ new message requests. I click on it. Go in. Nothing. No message requests. I hit edit. Delete all. 3 minutes later I go on and it says I have 100+ new message requests. This is getting entirely annoying and I would really like something to be done about this. I don‚Äôt know if anyone else is having this problem or if it‚Äôs a bug. If it could be addressed or I could be told where I could turn off being able to receive messages from people who aren‚Äôt my friend that would be great. I‚Äôve also been linked into group messages with people I don‚Äôt know by someone I don‚Äôt know to be tried to be sold something. (Probably a phishing link to be honest.) I really don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs even an option to be messages by people you don‚Äôt know but that‚Äôs a separate issue. Please fix this problem as honestly it‚Äôs a nuisance."	positive
36	454638411	social	3	"However, it's super irritating with this current version, that I can't play messenger games with people without it looking like I have an unread message from each individual because either them or I have made a move in the game. App badges would be enough for me, within the application. Separate the games notifications from the messenge notifications please! Badges on the game tab and that's it would be super nice. If I want to play games I'll go over there. But I'm actually losing messages in all these integrated game notifications...

Also still having an issue with messenger not allowing me to continue typing a message when the phone is rotated. The whole app freezes and I am forced to close or send a half typed message. Many times this happens and it was not intentional at all. A fix would be fantastic. Currently functioning off iOS 11.2.1 on the 7plus."	positive
37	454638411	social	1	"I am so disappointed with this new update. Here are just a few things I have encountered so far that is very disappointing and frustrating:

1.) can‚Äôt send balloon emojis anymore. This is a feature I used extremely regularly with friends. 

2.) the notification sound has changed to a default iPhone sound and I have tried everything to change it back to the messenger notification sound. I miss the sound of the messenger notification but more importantly it‚Äôs caused confusion: every time I receive a messenger notification from a friend now I think I‚Äôm receiving a text from a client or important calendar notification. I am used to having separate sounds for separate notification, more specifically a separate sound for business/important (text/calendar) and social (messenger). With this update I no longer have that distinction on sound so I‚Äôm constantly picking up my phone when I don‚Äôt need to be.

3.) no sound sending message

4.) no bubbling hearts across screen when you send a heart emoji

There‚Äôs other things I don‚Äôt care for esthetically but that based on person preference, I can get used to. The things I listed above are simply an inconvenience and frustrating to the functionality of messenger and I think you need to re-evaluate. I never really write reviews, but I am very upset about this update. I use messenger all day every day and this update is a big turn off to the application I once loved."	negative
38	454638411	social	4	"Good app, let‚Äôs me keep in contact with others. Initially I deactivated Facebook when I was in school, but was allowed to use messenger still. After a while for some reason that stopped being the case and it deactivated messenger too. Well, that wasn‚Äôt an option because I have a family chat on there and otherwise I would have been out of the loop. Minor issue, done with school now so not as big of a problem, until I return for degree number two. Video quality could be a bit better too. 

Also, my dog absolutely HATES the message notification. He will run away when he hears it. I would prefer a list of audible options for the sake of my dogs ears, and me being upset when he leaves due to a message coming through. Minor detail, but it makes me want to get rid of the app all together."	negative
39	454638411	social	1	I used to love using messenger because it kept me connected to my family but not now. Since FB changed it‚Äôs requirement to use Messenger I no longer am able to connect with the most important person in my life. There are extremely important reasons they don‚Äôt have FB. Safety being the most important one. FB only cares about it‚Äôs bottom line.  Did not think about the ones who use messenger only because of the type of job they have. Those in law enforcement, military members and others who work for our country. I am ashamed I will still need to use messenger to stay connected to the rest of my family. But I will not encourage anyone to join FB.  Now I am researching other messaging apps. By the way, my most important person had messenger before you made the change and getting any help with this issue is non existent. FB does not care about the people that use it. Thanks for screwing up my communication with someone I love very much FB. That‚Äôs sarcasm in case you don‚Äôt recognize it.	positive
40	454638411	social	4	Messenger is a good app and I like to talk and connect with people on the app. And the sticker feature I really like since you can pick from a wide variety of different things. But the thing I recently hated about messenger is that I can no longer save gifs that I send to my friends or anyone, and I used to be able to do that and I would give a five star rating then, but now only four because I really need moving memes in my life and in my photo album, please consider letting us save gifs again. I know I may sound silly but I‚Äôm really upset that I can‚Äôt save them anymore and I found my favorite meme on gif recently and I can‚Äôt save it no more so I beg you, please let us save gifs again, but if theirs a new feature we‚Äôre you can save it but just have to click something different then please tell me :(	positive
41	454638411	social	3	Only three stars and here is why. First the good. Messaging and sending photos is it‚Äôs strong points. I have had zero problems with doing either and if I were to rate solely based on the two it would receive five stars. However, the actual calling is for me what hurts the app the most. Annoying doesn‚Äôt even begin to explain my feelings towards that particular feature. I have yet to get or to make an actual call, as to where, the call doesn‚Äôt take it upon itself to just end. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just on my end but I suspect not. It doesn‚Äôt seem to make a difference from where it ordinates the result is the same. Call abruptly ends for no reason and then you are asked to rate the call. HAHAHAHA!! What a joke. Instant one star and not even deserving of the one. So again the messaging and photo sending are excellent, the calling function not so much.	positive
42	454638411	social	5	"Edit: hey you fixed it, nice. Typing on iPad is pain still layout wise but it works.

Messenger usually works well on my iPhone no issues what so ever, in this case for an odd reason it doesn‚Äôt want to type I‚Äôll begin typing ‚ÄúHey I‚Äôm‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt let me type afterwards. I have no idea why this occurring but I hope I‚Äôm not alone, I use this app to talk to friends and talk about homework and junk‚Äî this is a real pain and honestly a bad move on the team‚Äôs part for not checking before sending this update out. This could‚Äôve honestly been fixed or avoided if they checked this before releasing it, I trust on the team a lot and will always update on day one. You‚Äôre making me regret this honestly, y‚Äôall just giving me trust issues"	positive
43	454638411	social	1	"Firstly, I am not a fan of the update at all. I particularly liked the availability to see if someone had read the conversation without actually having to open it, but that has been taken away. The 'active now' status is totally inaccurate, it'll say someone i'm physically with is active when their phone is locked in an entirely different room. My biggest peeve, though, is the inaccuracy of the read tag. If an hour goes by since the message was delivered, it'll read delivered until it is opened, but as soon as it is opened, it'll say ""read one hour ago"". No matter how long it's sat on delivered and how much later it's read, it'll always read that it was read however long ago it was delivered, when, in fact, it could have been opened 13 hours afterward. You claim to be focusing your app around professionalism, but how professional does it make you when you're ""leaving your boss on read"" when you're just finally getting to open the message?"	positive
44	454638411	social	5	"I used to be able to get to the ‚Äúother‚Äù folder but now that is gone. Please redo this and fix because many messages get filtered and now I can‚Äôt get those. Long time user.
**EDIT** I found this setting finally. One last thing that would be a great addition is to give us the option to remain hidden. I don‚Äôt want everyone knowing I‚Äôm online. I have active turned off and I can‚Äôt see who is active but the ones who have active on can still see me. Also it would be nice to have an option that doesn‚Äôt show its read. Sometimes I can‚Äôt reply in a timely fashion and it leaves the person thinking I don‚Äôt care enough to respond. Yes I can mark it as unread but they can see it‚Äôs been read. My main suggestions. Thank you so much"	positive
45	454638411	social	4	"The messaging with FB friends is pretty good. I like that you can customize individual chats and I enjoy the sound effects in the app. It‚Äôs a really good way to stay in touch with far away friends & family. I don‚Äôt always get notifications when I receive a new message though.
I‚Äôm not a fan of the call/video chat feature. Calls are often dropped, the sound/call quality is awful. Video chat is really choppy. A lot of the video calls are spent ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù so all you see is a black screen , but at least you can still talk to the other person while this is going on. 

This app isn‚Äôt too bad , it works better than the Facebook app itself in my opinion. It‚Äôs a good way to stay connected and talking to old friends. I recommend using it if you got Facebook."	positive
46	454638411	social	4	I mean it works fine most of the time but obviously as some people has already said it struggles to send messages to others. Honestly still waiting it to send a message to my cousin it‚Äôs been two days? Even if my internet is slow it still sends to everyone else so that makes no sense. Only other issue you guys need to add a delete button; again my internet is slow so I have to wait forever just to log into Facebook on my computer to go into messenger to delete things but I shouldn‚Äôt need to go on there to do this id appreciate it if someone could consider this idea to add this ability on the app especially when you log onto Facebook through the phone it doesn‚Äôt give you the same option and just sends you back to the app?	positive
47	454638411	social	1	And if you don't get what I'm saying, then it's time for you to check out what a dark pattern is on Google. This app was only good nay excellent back when they first released it. It made me ditch the monstrous Facebook app. It revolutionized IM, read receipts and stuff. It was way more usable. It was lighter, too. Browsing pictures wasn't the pain it is today. Besides, half of the features just don't work. I can select pictures in a given order all I want; it seems they are uploaded as possible, the 'lighter' uploading first thus being put first. Also three months ago, I had to change a password that was perfectly fine for no reason, and the first thing that Facebook tried to trick me into was to give them my phone number so that I could keep my password. What's the link between both? Nothing but a dark pattern. All in all, this app is Facebook's new cancer. Oh, and each time I launch this garbage, it asks me for my phone number and contacts; no thanks, Zuckey.	negative
48	454638411	social	3	Can it be fixed so people have a reply for each topic of conversation? Gets confusing for people to stay on the subject. Also people tend to not look above to read previous comments. That‚Äôs aggravating. Why does it tell when people erase things. People get suspicious when the message comes up. They want to know what was erased. No need for that. Also I don‚Äôt understand when I want to delete something it shows Remove for you and Remove for everyone. If I‚Äôm talking to one person - why would I just want it removed for me? And who is everyone?  If that comes up - I‚Äôm thinking - who did it go to. I don‚Äôt talk to groups of people. I also worry that certain people with knowledge know how to look at a person‚Äôs Messenger. How can I be assured that doesn‚Äôt happen?? I‚Äôve got everything in messenger settings turned off that has an on/off button.	negative
49	454638411	social	5	"MAJOR ISSUE #1 - Messenger DOES NOT  Prevent Repeated Audio/Video Calls 

When Messenger is set for DND, it only allows for a 24hr period. RANDOM callers who are using the app as a dating app will call back multiple times within a three minute window and interrupt my day or sleep. I cannot shut my phone down completely as I have to remain accessible to family. I would like the option of DND until I DECIDE turn it back on with the option of keeping out repeat callers who call right back within a 3 minute window. Right now I have to reset Messenger DND every 8 hours. 

MAJOR ISSUE #2: Why do I get Messenger notifications EVERY SINGLE TIME I accept a new FBF request that says ‚Äúwave to your new friend?‚Äù I do not need this added message that draws ppl to contact me as if this is a dating app. I use Messenger only to contact ppl for important non-public information. Not to hook up. Just like I have to choice to add someone as a FBF, I should have to choice if I want to add them as a messenger contact. This should NOT be automatic! How dare you take away my choice and subject me to unnecessary harassment!

50	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	I was skeptical to start a program like NOOM because of the price and because I didn‚Äôt know if it would work for me. I have struggled with weight for most of my adult life and it has not been easy for me to lose weight. I am entering week nine in the NOOM program and have lost 12 pounds! While this may not seem like much, it is weight that I have not been able to lose on my own. I am a registered nurse and I feel that a slower, steady weight loss is a healthier way to go. I have seen many others in my life lose and then gain right back. The program has been so helpful in many ways. I like the fact that there‚Äôs really nothing that you can‚Äôt eat in the program, but more like how much you eat of it. The program breaks down for you the three levels of food and how much you should be eating in each of those categories. It has been more of a lifestyle change and making you aware of what you were actually eating. I really love the program. I think that it is really great to have a coach and a support team to reach out to 24 hours a day, and to also have recipes recommended by the program. I invited a friend to join the program as well and she really enjoyed it but she ended with her trial due to the pricing for her. I have a ways to go to meet my goal, but I am off to a great start thanks to NOOM! So I give this program five stars, but if it were just slightly less expensive, more people could benefit from it.	positive
51	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	"I just finished my one year subscription with Noom and it was the best money I ever spent! I started last Jan at 215lbs. I saw the commercial on TV, New Years Eve and thought the app looked colorful and fun like a game. I thought it would be entertaining enough to keep my interest, but it was so much more. I learned about all the eating mistakes I was making. I learned what to eat, what to limit, what to increase. Because of my immediate success during the trial, I decided to pay for the subscription. I just wanted to get under 200lbs and be in less pain! 
Noom helped me work through so many of my life issues where I was stuck! 
I hit my goal and kept going. I felt like the pace was perfect. The lessons were really motivating, and the group was safe and encouraging. I hit 162.5 in October. Because of Noom I challenged myself to create a more balanced lifestyle. I started walking, then running, and finished 2 5K‚Äôs. I‚Äôm now Snowshoeing several times a week and have signed up for 5 - 5K‚Äôs in 2020. 
My work has improved so much, I‚Äôve received several raises and so much encouragement. All my coworkers are inspired as well as many friends who have joined Noom too! 
I‚Äôve managed to keep the weight off even through the holidays and now in Winter. Noom really works, especially if you have some supportive encouraging friends to walk and share with. If you do this, and stay really honest with yourself, it works, no excuses!"	positive
52	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	Yes, I still eat pizza, peanut butter, bread and still drink wine. But logging all these foods in, which is quite easy (I do it by dictating to my iPhone) has shown me how much those foods affect my calorie intake and health. I‚Äôve learned that I can still be happy eating those foods less often. I like that Noom does not necessarily exclude any food type or food group. But they definitely make you aware of the foods that will benefit you in weight loss. Noom is all about swapping out good things over less good things. It‚Äôs about figuring out how to avoid temptation by having the right foods around and the right frame of mind to deal with temptation. It‚Äôs about replacing good habits with less good habits. It‚Äôs about connecting things that you really like with things that you need to improve on in an effort to create a new and more beneficial habit. My morning ritual now includes a big cup of coffee and some quiet time reading my Noom articles, some area bit goofy but still fun to read and informative. I‚Äôm a much better eater now and it‚Äôs actually been fun making the transition. I‚Äôve lost over 18 pounds over nine weeks, way more than I anticipated. For me it‚Äôs been 100% about looking at the food I eat every day and understanding how those foods affect your weight loss journey. It definitely takes dedication and a certain amount of concentration to make progress but I guess that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about.	positive
53	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	I‚Äôm very pleased with the approach Noom takes to weight loss. It‚Äôs about helping you change your thinking about food and helping you make gradual changes in your lifestyle that will lead to sustainable weight loss. It‚Äôs well paced, informative, and well supported by coaches and a personalized group. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the customer support which was TERRIBLE! The sign up process is somewhat confusing. (E.g. different levels of payment for trial and total for subscription). When I had questions about this, I discovered there was NO phone support available. I had to use email which turned into a long, convoluted thread. I had to write my questions multiple times to 3 different people, none of whom answered them fully. In between, I received numerous automated emails saying that if I did not reply within 3 days, they would consider the matter closed. I was told I ‚Äúshould‚Äù have gotten a receipt multiple times (I didn‚Äôt). After 4 to 5 days of this and with no recourse to talk to someone, I finally cried ‚Äúuncle.‚Äù Had one person simply fully addressed my questions, I would not be writing this. I think there was an assumption that I wanted my money back even though I wrote several times that this was not the case. I did let them know that I was very unhappy with their customer support response but, given that no one seemed to fully read my previous emails, I rather doubt that they read it.	negative
54	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	"This is a phenomenal weight loss tool that is being held back by its lack of customer support. I‚Äôve tried so many programs, both on my own and ones that require an app or a meeting, etc. This one actually works. I love that the science behind weight loss is shared on a daily basis with users and that there is validation that weight loss isn‚Äôt easy and there‚Äôs no magic formula that makes it that way. This truly is a program that aims to educate and promote lifelong, sustainable habits that lead to a healthy weight and lifestyle. 
However, their customer support is severely lacking. Personal coaching is touted as a main feature of this app. Where is it?  My group receives what appear to be automated articles and challenges daily, but after two weeks (ironically once my free trial was up and I started paying for the program) my ‚Äúpersonal coach‚Äù has disappeared. I have some operational questions about the app that I can‚Äôt get answers to and the ‚ÄúHelp‚Äù section is no help at all. 
This is a problem, Noom!  This is a paid program that is developed by what appears to be highly intelligent and well trained people in the field of weight loss. 
I will stick with the program because the weight loss portion does work. I don‚Äôt want my money back and would recommend this program to others. But I would appreciate a response from the developer. One that isn‚Äôt automated as it appears the other developer responded see I‚Äôve read seem to be."	positive
55	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	"I‚Äôve been dieting on and off since my teen years and I just didn‚Äôt want to live that life anymore. Noom offered a balanced perspective full of sound advice and well-researched science. I lost a bit of weight and more importantly I feel like I‚Äôm in control (and happy with) my own day-to-day. I‚Äôm healthier and feel totally free of the yo-yo diet loop. Lots of great support in my chat group and a fantastic curriculum meant new perspectives and sustainable healthy habits. It was 100% worth it for me.

Oh small note to the developers - I agree with others, the app could use a little work. It took up a ton of space on my phone (over a half gig!) and the messaging portion could be easier to use (better thread management, the ability to edit messages, etc...) but overall really nice product! Very well-designed UI/UX-wise and easy to use :)

Also for others researching, a couple of notes: it‚Äôs definitely not a ‚Äúfast results‚Äù kind of program; or at least it wasn‚Äôt for me. It‚Äôs more about changing your whole lifestyle, which takes time. Also the coach was not super helpful for me - they don‚Äôt respond in a very personalized way (was wondering if it was a bot for a little while) and only check in semi-regularly, so if that‚Äôs a big priority for you, I would look elsewhere. It‚Äôs more of a reminder, ‚Äúkeep you on track‚Äù tool than actual personalized guidance, which was a little disappointing."	positive
56	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	I am now going into my fifth week with Noom.  I find it to be a good overall concept and I have learned many things about myself, and about nutrition, and human nature, but am I losing weight?  Not much, but I do plan to stay with the program for at least another month.  While I feel that the basic concept is sound, there are some issues that need adjusting.  (1) The program‚Äôs daily lessons are centered around a working woman‚Äôs or man‚Äôs environment, i.e. office , co-workers, break room, etc.  They don‚Äôt seem to realize that there are those of us who have left this part of our lives behind and moved on, or, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any appropriate material for a stay-at-home mom or dad, or for any other younger, or older persons out of this working‚Äù category.  This hard for me to follow.  (2) They tout one-on-one attention, and, truly, you are given a food coach, assigned to a group, and given a group coach as well.  However, I‚Äôm not sure that these coaches are not bots.  Asked questions sometimes are not answered for 24-48 hours (and never on a weekend).  When they are answered, they are impersonal and often do not apply to the real situation at hand.  I do think that this customer service aspect could be improved, or, strike the personal touch from the app advertising.  In short, is this a good program?  Yes, but if you want quicker weight loss and personal attention, I would take my business to Weight Watchers.	positive
57	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	"This is the first program to work for me because it has helped me to get rid of the thought processes that have always resulted in my failure in the past.  It gives you not only the ‚Äúdo‚Äù, but the ‚Äúwhy to do‚Äù based on the science of it.  I have to have that for me to really rely on the information and incorporate it into habits.  This is the first program that has been successful for me to really change my relationship with food and to make it a lifestyle and not a diet.  My weight loss is slow, but I believe that is the best kind of weight loss for me.  I believe this will be sustainable.  

There are some improvements that, in my opinion, should be made.  One is to have a better proofread. There are a substantial number of typos in the articles. This unnecessarily detracts from the credibility of the information which you certainly want to avoid, and is easily avoidable.   Another is to make the logging easier by 1) not making a person close out the logging section to switch from one meal or snack to another 2) incorporating a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù search that brings up words that are close to a misspelled word so that you don‚Äôt get a blank unless you know how to spell a word exactly correctly.  Finally, using less acronyms.  They are, in my opinion, distracting and don‚Äôt provide the repetition of the concept as well as using the actual words."	positive

All I‚Äôve done so far is log my meals, my liquids, and pay closer attention to my caloric intake and try to stay around the 2000 calorie mark. I‚Äôm not perfect. I have messed up by eating more than I should have, but NOOM is helping me hold myself accountable. By logging my meals, I have a visual of what I‚Äôve been putting in my body. By watching my weight steadily decline on the graph, it‚Äôs boosted my self-esteem and that‚Äôs given me the encouragement to keep making good food and drink choices for myself. Having lived through other diet failures and having had surgery to lose weight, with no success, I was very skeptical about being successful with NOOM. I enjoy reading the article and I like that I can save them for future reference. I‚Äôm an addictions counselor and use the same psychological referencing from the S.M.A.R.T goals that NOOM offers, to lead my addictions clients, but I never thought about using S.M.A.R.T goals to help me lose weight. So far, I‚Äôm very happy with NOOM and how easy it is to use. With the Holiday season quickly approaching, I am excited to know I will be able to enjoy the eats and treats and not feel deprived because I have all the tools I need to recognize those triggers and help me psychologically break down my behaviors so I can combat my cravings. For me, it‚Äôs all about planning ahead and being prepared!	positive
59	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	I was skeptical when I first started the trial. I have been through Weight Watchers, at least  five times in my adult lifespan. It‚Äôs a good program, it teaches you how to eat. But at this stage of my life it did not fit into my busy schedule. I did not have time to work around the limited meetings in my area to weigh in. Roughly a month into this program, I have lost almost 10 pounds without much inconvenience, LOL-if that‚Äôs a good description. The things I mark it down for are a limited data base when you go to scan in a food to add it to your daily intake. That will improve with time. (I‚Äôm certainly helping, you can choose to input your food info as you go). I‚Äôd have to say that these people are on your case 24/7 to help keep you on track. You also have access to multiple other people who are doing this at the same time you are. I think the message board could be organized in a better fashion, to be more user-friendly and to allow you to have access to multiple threads at one time without being confused. All in all, I‚Äôm going to stick with this because it fits into my life at this time. It addresses psychological issues as to why people choose to eat what they eat, and why they overeat the wrong things. You are given the tools, should you choose to use them, to deal with these situations that affect those of us who have always had a complicated relationship with food.	positive
60	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	I enjoyed some aspects of this ap.  The articles and quizzes were interesting and informative. However, the coaching and other aspects were lacking.   I‚Äôm not sure if my coach was a real person or just computer generated responses to my comments.  All ‚Äúher‚Äù comments were pretty bland and generic.  In addition, you are apparently supposed to be placed in a group with other Noom members for support which I never was.  When I asked about the group 6 weeks later I was put into a ‚Äúquiet group‚Äù with others who also had never been put into an ‚Äúactive group,‚Äù had cancelled membership (me) or out there for a few other reasons. I kinda felt like I was in trouble for no reason.  Several of us asked to be put into an active group so we could see if this made a difference in our ap experience but, no response after 48 hours.  I am also in agreement with others that the food logging is lacking. After a somewhat timely process of entering a few ‚Äúmeals‚Äù they didn‚Äôt show up in my food for the day nor did it recall my ‚Äúmeal‚Äù the following week.  Lastly, I really wanted to concentrate on toning and building muscle and not as much on losing weight.  Although I listed this in my goals there was no way to track this nor was this ever brought up by my coach.  This is not a cheap ap at $49/month.  Definitely not worth it to me.	positive
61	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	"I‚Äôm on week 14 and have had a lot of success ‚Äîlost 15lbs so far and really managing portion control. I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I weigh in daily, log all my meals and exchange messages weekly with my personal coach but don‚Äôt get anything from the group support aspect and haven‚Äôt read the daily blurbs in a while. Even so, I‚Äôm still finding success and sense of accountability with the logging and correspondence with my coach. I‚Äôve tried free logging apps before and just did not experience the same level of progress.  

What really got me on here to write a review is that I REALLY wish the custom dishes were searchable so I don‚Äôt have to scroll through weeks of meals I‚Äôve logged to find what I‚Äôm looking for. We have a lot of hello fresh and go-to meals where this would be most helpful. Having editable custom dishes is a great feature! As we refine recipes, the ability to update rather than having to log it in from scratch again saves energy and keeps my recipes more organized üëçüèº 

Something else that could be improved is the expediency in which foods are added to the database. I‚Äôve taken the time to add the food and it‚Äôs nutritional value, I should be able to search that item within a couple weeks‚Äî I know it takes time for someone to review the entry and upload it to the overall database but I‚Äôd say two weeks is a fair amount of time to get that added."	positive
62	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	"I lost over 40# in 6 months with the NOOM program and app.  This has absolutely amazed me and my friends!  The philosophy and science behind the methods were the perfect ones for me and I have never felt so good while trying to lose weight, physically and mentally.  You do have to make a monetary commitment but that‚Äôs no different from most weight loss programs.  You also have to make a daily commitment to read for about 10 minutes, to log your foods and your activity level.  I believe this all made so much sense to me and became a large part of why I was successful beyond my wildest dreams.  I learned so much about myself and good and activity and living the right way for myself, making MY choices.  Learning why certain foods were advantageous to eat over others.  How certain foods made me feel.  Portion control was a huge lifestyle change and a real eye opening lesson learned!
I could go on and on, but NOOM is definitely a way of life for those who want to learn and lose and aren‚Äôt just wanting a quick fix for the moment.  You do the work, you get the reward!
My doctor and nurse are amazed at my new bloodwork numbers, weight and flexibility in just 6 months!  Oh..... did I mention that I am 70 years old?!  So, it‚Äôs never to late to feel and look your best!  And by eating real food at home and in restaurants."	positive
63	634598719	health_and_fitness	3	I like this app but the developers could make it much more user friendly. First, I need to be able to see my food diary without trying to log a meal. There needs to be a tab called Food Diary and another called Analytics where you can see your ‚Äúcolors‚Äù as they develop across the day. Currently, you can only see the diary or macro breakdown if you are about to log a food. Sometimes you want to see your progress without entering food, to analyze your data to plan ahead, but you can‚Äôt with this app. Also, I like to log ahead ‚Äî I do this in myfitnesspal ‚Äî if I know my work day will be busy, and this keeps me on track. You can‚Äôt do that on Noom. There is no way to plan ahead. This is particularly bad if I know I‚Äôm going out for one meal and need to plan the other meals to be lighter ‚Äî and as a result, I keep going over, even trying to be conservative. And, finally, Noom doesn‚Äôt have a tab for logging exercise. You have to select ‚Äúdo more‚Äù and drill down to the limited exercise menu, which needs more options. They need to add HIIT workouts there. And finally, this is the beginning of week 2, and I have yet to talk to a goal specialist. I‚Äôve gotten some bot-type interactions, but she won‚Äôt actually respond to me or my questions. She‚Äôs just kind of a push notification, like ‚Äúgood job for logging veggies today!‚Äù The cost is supposed to pay for the coach. If there‚Äôs no coach, then this is just a less robust version of myfitnesspal.	positive
64	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	"I will try to update my review as I see weight loss, but I am on week 5. And this isn‚Äôt about weight loss (any longer) for me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have quite a bit of weight to lose, but this app is helping me change small habits one day at a time and it‚Äôs doing more for my brain than my body right now. My body is benefiting though...I am moving more and making better food choices. I have not lost much weight yet, but my mind is definitely changing and I truly believe that weight loss and a healthy body is in my near future. If you want to try something out to make you feel better about your relationship with food and make small changes for permanent change....this is the app.

It‚Äôs a lot of small daily tasks and readings, but doesn‚Äôt take too much time per day and I personally like to read more about why we do things so that I understand why I want to do them. The goal is achievable lifetime habits and I feel like I am erasing 30+ years of bad habits a little each day. Love the community aspect too...I feel like we motivate each other to keep logging in each day! Coaches check in once a week to create goals and community coaches are usually poking into the group every couple days. I think it‚Äôs less about depending on a coach and more about believing in yourself, but the coaches are there as a bonus!"	positive
65	634598719	health_and_fitness	3	I loved Noom through the first month. I actually lost 9 lbs and felt like I was finally on my way to weight loss. It‚Äôs now been nearly three months and I haven‚Äôt lost any more weight. Obviously I am responsible for my self control, but Noom doesn‚Äôt provide a system to make you feel back on track once you get off track. First, they send you 5-6 articles a day which get to be exhausting over a long period. Many articles build on each other so if you miss three or four days then you will see references from previous articles you won‚Äôt understand unless you go digging through those that you missed. When you‚Äôre struggling to revive motivation, becoming weighed down by information is not helpful. Second, the weight loss coaches are amateur. I‚Äôve had two now and I‚Äôve had the same issues with both: very slow response time and unhelpful advice. For response timing, I‚Äôve waited as much as five days for a response to a simple question. As for the content of the advice, it‚Äôs mostly questions in a Socratic form or stuff that is already heavily hit on in the articles. If I ask a question, 90% of the responses are another question. ‚ÄúWhat can I do to stop my junk food cravings?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, what are some habits you could form to avoid craving junk?‚Äù If I could answer that question, I wouldn‚Äôt have asked. I appreciate the system for what it is, but I did pay a lot of money to get the program.	negative
66	634598719	health_and_fitness	2	I had really high hopes for this app! First let me start off that after 2 weeks of your trial, they will charge you $130 for 4 months without notice. You also can‚Äôt get a refund if you‚Äôre not satisfied with that because ‚Äúyou had two weeks to cancel‚Äù. I guess that was my fault. Next thing is, you start off with a 2000 calorie budget and then it drops lower and lower. I feel as if Noom wants me to starve myself. I work outside, I am constantly sweating and walking around. I‚Äôm going to eat, and I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel bad about going over 1300 calories while eating healthy foods. Second of all, they list some foods that are high in nutrition like almonds/peanut butter and oatmeal as ‚Äúred foods‚Äù. This makes me feel like I can‚Äôt eat anything, I only have so much time to make something quick and healthy that will fill me up until lunch time. Overall, I‚Äôm really not pleased with this app! I know it‚Äôs all psych tricks to make you break your bad habits but it‚Äôs just not working for me. I really wish I could get my money back. The only good part is counting my calories and seeing if my weight goes down by logging it in. I also believe they should let us take pictures of our meals for accurate calorie calculations, as in they measure how much calories our plate has and we list the things in them. That would help! I don‚Äôt recommend Noom if you‚Äôre broke like me, just constantly go to the gym and eat more veggies than yummy foods! That‚Äôs been working for me!	positive
67	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	"I‚Äôve had good success with this program. It took twice as long as predicted, but then again I didn‚Äôt try very hard. In fact, I feel like I did very little and it still worked! The group stuff is great, the goal specialist is ok so long as you keep your expectations in check. The content, while the real content lasts, is excellent. It would be better slowed down and stretched out a bit, so it‚Äôs easier to retain.

Pros: 1. The program really works! 2. Activity/Active Calories/Steps data works flawlessly with Apple Watch/health kit 3. The support group and group coaches are awesome 4. Can read data from other (more robust and free) logging apps like MyFitnessPal if you prefer. 4. Great content for the first month or two

My complaints: 1. Food database is better than expected but nowhere near as great as MFP. 2. Logging salads is the worst. There‚Äôs no way to save meals or create recipes to save time 3. Weird technical issues. For example, if you want to change payment plans you have to delete the app and start over (Or so I was told). 4. Goal Specialists are hit or miss. 5. There‚Äôs no pricing to continue with your group and logging after you‚Äôve reached your goal. So you continue to pay a premium price, or you quit.  6. The red, yellow, green ratio doesn‚Äôt quite work for vegetarians"	positive
68	634598719	health_and_fitness	3	"I‚Äôve been using another app to monitor my macros and exercise for some time. I was having weight issues because of the humidity and swelling and no continued weight loss. It‚Äôs imperative I don‚Äôt gain weight as I‚Äôm an amputee and device fit is essential. What I discovered was it was environmental and plateau. My weight went up. It was muscular as my clothes did not fit any differently. My device didn‚Äôt fit good. That was weather and exercise related. It was hot and humid. I was doing interval training 5 days a week combined with biking. So when the weather changed everything changed and the plateau broke. My diet really remained the same. My devices began fitting the way they should fit once the humidity and temp dropped. 
 I was very unhappy with the way food was categorized by caloric density. I could not understand why some high fat foods were Yellow and other foods were Red. I even questioned it and got answers I just didn‚Äôt like them. It was just something I wasn‚Äôt willing to change. I also wasn‚Äôt sure about doing weight daily. I learned to chart it weekly vs daily. 
I‚Äôll continue to do my food and weight charting. Even chart it daily. I find that helpful.
The psychology being used is somewhat repetitive for me. Grateful for the 2 week trial. Very minimal assistance from specialists. Every 4 days doesn‚Äôt seem worth the price. 
If it works for other, great! Go for it. Just not my thing."	positive
69	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	"I have been using Noom for about two months. Having the support both from the articles in the app and the group chat have definitely helped me. I went in with about 50 pounds to lose to get to a healthy weight, and I needed an easy, nonjudgemental place to start. Currently I‚Äôm down about 24 pounds, feeling great. The app offers me support and gives me someone to talk to about my struggles that people in my everyday life just don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs somewhat customizable, I wanted to lose weight quicker, so I might have a different ‚Äúcalorie budget‚Äù than others. 
The app didn‚Äôt really tell me anything I didn‚Äôt know about weight loss. If you think you can lower your calorie consumption and exercise regularly on your own, then you might not need this. But for me it‚Äôs important to have daily reminders and tips on the psychology behind weight loss. 

My criticism would be on the payment plan. The app charges you four months all at once after the free trial. At $44 a month, it‚Äôs a big chunk of cash for a broke college student like me. I would have preferred to pay by month to lessen the load. I found myself using a lot of the features from the app at first, but now I think I have the hang of it. I would have tried a period of time without the app to continue weight loss but the money has already been spent."	negative
70	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	What I liked: the motivation to weigh in, the weight chart, most of the content (although it‚Äôs very cutesy and hashtag-heavy), and the ability to log exercise. What I though was pretty good: the calorie-logging function. I have nothing to compare it to short of reading labels and writing on paper, so I don‚Äôt know how it compares in simplicity and accuracy with other apps that might be out there. I thought it was pretty easy. What I didn‚Äôt use or find helpful: The weekly check-in from my goal specialist and the group coaching. Once a week I would get asked a generic question by my specialist. They only communicate with you once a week. Also, group coaching on an app is just not for me. I don‚Äôt want to be looking at my phone all day and reading other people‚Äôs responses and trying to figure out what to say back. That is way too time-consuming. So after the first introduction I never went back to the group. I didn‚Äôt have too much weight to lose, I signed up to give me some accountability for what I was eating. It was eye-opening. I liked Noom for tracking what I ate and making me think differently. I did it for two months and it helped, I took off the few lbs I wanted to lose and have maintained within a couple pounds. I have to say, when following the program, I was almost always hungry! Losing weight is no joke.	positive
71	634598719	health_and_fitness	2	"While, the concept of Noom is pretty good, the app is not user-friendly except for daily activities. Only available contact with a Noom ‚Äòcoach‚Äô is available; and conversation, although promised on a daily basis, is sporadic (once a week)at best. I had an issue with not receiving the meal plan and exercise plan - buyer beware -  this is an add-on $$ at sign-up. When I inquired on how to receive a refund for the plan I didn‚Äôt receive from my ‚Äòcoach‚Äô, the only thing I received was a link to cancel my membership.  Since I could not find any alternative contact information, that‚Äôs just what I did, still not having received the meal plan/ exercise plan that I paid for up front. 
FYI: Noom makes you wait until your free trial period is over before setting you up with full access to the program - there‚Äôs no real way to understand if the program is a fit for you until after you pay the full fee.  Sure, food logging and step counting is great, and there are some recipes in the app. And daily information, but this isn‚Äôt really anything that can‚Äôt be found outside the app.  There‚Äôs no real taste of the program until you pay the joining fee.  I‚Äôm disappointed in the free trial that only showed me that I would need 10-15 minutes a day (plus time to log each meal) to read through daily lessons and complete tasks.  Not hooked enough to shell out $150+ to find out if it‚Äôs a program I would stick to long term."	positive
72	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	"I really like this program. I wish I could give 4.5 stars.  The only problem is the group discussion board.   There is absolutely no organization. You are supposed to share things with the group but when you click on the link it doesn‚Äôt take you to a ‚Äúmodule‚Äù for that particular response.  It is just a big mess of responses to all different questions in no particular order that I can see.   So instead of everyone responding to question A and discussing, you have to scroll through the whole mess.   If you get a notification that someone responded to your comments or mentioned you in a comment and you click the notification same thing you are just dumped in the mess. 
People feel the need to post everything they have done. Again no specific module.   
I don‚Äôt have time to scroll through all of it.   I think Noomnerds need to look at how an online course or other apps, like Facebook, are set up. When you click a link it should take you to module on that question where everyone is responding.  If you get a notification clicking it should take you to the comment.  Want to post your daily activity....there should be a separate module for that also.  
I‚Äôve learned a lot with Noom. Based on science. Plenty of reinforcement. 
Could be a GREAT program if it was more organized."	negative
73	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	I started Noom in June of 2019, weighing 165 lbs and wanting to get in shape after recovering from ACL surgery and knew it would be easier if I were thinner. But isn‚Äôt that to story of my life. Everything would be easier if I were less heavy. I could move easier, fit in to more clothes and wear what I wanted. Those were things I‚Äôve wanted for years. I‚Äôve been a little overweight since I was about 13 years old. Always about 20/30 lbs more than where I needed to be. I even had someone ask me once when I was in my 20s if I was pregnant, I nearly died. I‚Äôve tried Nutrisystem and Weight Watchers, fad shakes and everything that I could find, but nothing really worked. Until Noom. I learned about my relationship with food. I learned about what I was choosing to eat and why. It changed my entire view about what I can eat and when I should eat it and why I should it. I lost 30 lbs and met my goal in four months. When my subscription automatically renewed, I emailed and asked for a refund, which they provided immediately. I‚Äôm now at 135 and maintaining my weight right where I want it to be using the tools I got with Noom. If you are even thinking about wanting to lose weight and change your life, don‚Äôt wait! Do it. This is a great program!!	positive
74	634598719	health_and_fitness	2	"I have over 100lbs to lose and know that dieting doesn‚Äôt work and wanted to try something different before taking the first steps towards Bariatric surgery. I‚Äôm at the five week mark and I‚Äôm not sure this is for me. First, I feel this program is not geared towards people who have 100+ pounds to lose but more so to people who have 15 or 20 pounds to lose. I also don‚Äôt like the sporadic contact with your goal specialist. It takes a week to hear back instead of having a conversation in the moment as the program makes it seem. I also am not a fan of the group. I think grouping people by their goals would be so much better. I‚Äôm in a group with people who are not massively overweight and it‚Äôs hard to be open when people with 15lbs to lose are like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on week 3 and lost 10lbs already!‚Äù meanwhile, I‚Äôm on week five and I‚Äôve lost 3lbs. It‚Äôs so discouraging and makes me wish I could turn the group function off! 

I also don‚Äôt like having to weigh in every day. I‚Äôve been taught that this is not a good way to measure weight loss as weight fluctuates due to many factors and weighing in weekly is more accurate for weight loss. Also, as someone who is a recovered and now massively overweight anorexic, daily weighing is so, so triggering and brings back old habits but that‚Äôs my own personal hang up. 

Overall, I love the psych tricks and they are helpful but I don‚Äôt think the $44 a month is worth it for what I‚Äôm getting."	negative
75	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	I have struggled with losing weight all my life, stuck in the yo yo syndrome. Lose it, Gain more.  Have tried numerous calorie counter apps and worked with several nutritionists.  After completing a Restart program and doing a three week sugar detox, my mind was set to eat healthier.  My daughter recommended that I try Noom and I can‚Äôt be happier.  Noom is way more than a calorie counter app. It is based on psychology, science, and sociology. Boom!  The missing link to everything else I‚Äôve tried.  You have a personal coach who works with you to get you over hurdles, set goals, gives positive feedback and encouragement.  You also have a group coach and a group to share successes and setbacks.  You receive daily articles covering all kinds of topics: understanding the Noom color system, setting goals, becoming a portion master, taming your elephant and making your rider strong, how to get through the dreaded plateau, and so much more.  SO MUCH MORE!  The app makes it easy to log your meals/ snacks and  has a library of great recipes.  I‚Äôm starting my ninth week and am very happy with my weight loss and progress.  I have made good habits, eating healthier, moving more, sleeping better, and BELIEVING in myself.   Take a journey with Noom and see how it changes your life!  It has mine!	positive
76	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	I will start off by honestly saying, yes, this app has it‚Äôs issues. That said, I‚Äôve lost over 10 lbs in just 4 weeks and I look and feel better than I have in years! I‚Äôm currently wearing a pair of jeans that look brand new but they are over 5 years old because I haven‚Äôt been able to fit into them until now! Don‚Äôt listen to the negative comments. Those are from people who don‚Äôt need to lose weight or are not seriously trying to. I would never in a thousand years diet, but this program is so simple it‚Äôs not like dieting at all! No food is ‚Äúbad‚Äù or off limits, instead I‚Äôve learned to master what I eat instead of it controlling my thoughts. I still eat at McDonald‚Äôs and Wendy‚Äôs and even enjoy a full sugar dessert if I want. It‚Äôs all about budgeting your calories each day to make it fit. I never feel hungry. In fact, I‚Äôm honestly not as hungry as I was before I started Noom and I enjoy eating now more than I have in years!! If you have always wanted a smaller, healthier you, there is nothing out there like this program to get you there with the minimalistic amount of hassle, I promise you! Stop waiting! You get two weeks free and if you find me on Facebook and msg me, I will send you a link so you can get it for less than $20 a month!	positive
77	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	"I am so grateful to have found Noom! It is technically a weight-loss program, but it is more of a sustainable, life-changing program. It has taught me more about how I think about myself, my relationship with food, the physiological things in my body that impact my choices about eating and helped me be more aware of the environmental influences the influence my choices. Aside from the initial cost, the only investment I have made is my time and attention. I am the mother of seven, working, and finding time for anything as hard. Because of the simplicity/completeness of the app, I don‚Äôt feel like I am wasting my time at all. This isn‚Äôt something that I will have to be connected to forever because the whole goal is to teach us all how to do it on our own instead of getting us reliant on a program. 
It has been one month and I have lost 10 pounds in a way that feels sustainable, encouraging and supported. In addition to all of the information and help noon provides, I have also been connected to a Noom support group where we help each other and troubleshoot together. It helps us to realize none of us are alone and none of us are perfect, and that is totally OK. I would do it again in a heartbeat and I‚Äôm grateful for the investment that I made!"	positive
78	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	I am really enjoying this program!  I do believe (after 4 weeks of putting this into practice) that I am on the way to changing my eating habits.  The science of what we eat, why we eat, when we eat, how we eat is put into easy to read (and easily digested üòâ) short articles.  There is online group support as well as an individual goal coach.  You are challenged to try something new, whether it be a form of exercise, a new food, or mostly, the way you think about food.  Logging your food is easy and informative.  Calories are counted but the major focus is on what fuels your body and leaves you satisfied.  Noom synchs with my Fitbit and counts my steps.  I would have given it a 5, but there are a few things that could be improved a little (had trouble at first with synching my Fitbit, group ‚Äúthreads‚Äù are sometimes hard to follow - probably more to do with us not understanding exactly how a thread works - the ability to copy and paste a recipe from another site to determine how this enters into the food log.  I have lost about 8 of the 30 pounds I plan to lose.  I list this benefit last because, even though my original goal was to lose weight, I think the greatest benefit is how it has changed my thinking and eating.	positive
79	634598719	health_and_fitness	2	"t the app has so many glitches. 

Let‚Äôs start at step one: sign up. My sign up just DID NOT WORK. I downloaded the app, signed up, then went to log in. It didn‚Äôt work. Kept saying my password was wrong. My password was not wrong. I reset it multiple times to no avail. Contacted customer service, who again advised me to reset the password. Then customer service insisted the only solution is I provide a new email address. I did this, got the app up and running ‚Äî only to realize five days later the lauded ‚Äúgroup‚Äù feature was totally missing. Then I realized when the updated my email address they put me in the healthy weight program instead of the diabetes prevention program I signed up for! A day or so later I realize the coach only infrequently interacts. Then I reach out to customer service again to get help and answers. Twenty four hours later, I‚Äôve received zero response. My seven day trial ‚Äî which I only got five days because I could not log in, expires tomorrow. I think I have to quit before the trial ends because I don‚Äôt want to pay for an expensive and non functional app with poor customer support. I‚Äôm disappointed. 

I want to love this app. I love the theory. I‚Äôve tried everything, literally, in the past. I just want to be healthy. I know it will take a slow change of mindset and lifestyle. Noom seems to have many of those bases covered. If only it actually worked as advertised."	positive
80	634598719	health_and_fitness	1	"This app is incredibly buggy, so you can‚Äôt really use it. IT was completely unhelpful. They say they have 24/7 support, but the app says they‚Äôll get back to sometime during standard business hours. It‚Äôs all done over email, which is such a time drain when their ‚Äúfix‚Äù ignores the initial question and you have to ask again. That‚Äôs bad for an all app-based program. If you add a food that‚Äôs not in data base, which I had to do a lot in just a few days, it doesn‚Äôt work with their ‚Äúred/yellow/green‚Äù system.

It rolls out features over time, so you don‚Äôt even know what you‚Äôre paying for in the 2-week trial until you‚Äôre past the cancellation deadline. I got a ‚Äúgoal specialist‚Äù that was supposed to contact my once a week. (A chatbot, but with a photo of a person your ‚Äúchat‚Äù.) There wasn‚Äôt any information about when groups would be introduced, and they put off telling you that there are hidden fees for different parts of the program. They charge for basic access to the app in one lump sum. You have to threaten to cancel to get a monthly rate, and it‚Äôs far less discounted than the up-front rate. If you request your data be deleted, they have 30 days to do whatever they want with it before they‚Äôll delete it. 

You can access recipes, chat groups, and weight trackers on a ton of free apps. This one just has a lot of shady business practices.  The positive is that the lay-out of the stuff that worked was cute."	positive
81	634598719	health_and_fitness	2	I used the app when I was motivated, read all the articles, grazed over the self-questioning quizzes, etc. I found weight loss success for a few weeks but it was slow going. Anyway, after losing motivation and not opening the app for months, I anticipated on cancelling. However, cancelling my $99 auto-renew subscription required me to send a message in the app to my group coach, something that I felt was designed to make me feel bad and then not actually cancel. So I did not send a message and assumed that since I had received a new credit card from the time I signed up, Noom wouldn‚Äôt be able to charge me and I was in the clear. Well, I was somehow charged anyway and two days after being charged, I sent a cancellation request to my group coach, with an explanation of what happened. She fortunately did not pressure me to stay with Noom but given that I have not used the app in months and cancelled my subscription two days after being charged again, I thought the company would be gracious enough to refund the new charge. NOPE! I can‚Äôt find a phone number anywhere to politely dispute the charge. All customer service issues are dealt with thru messages in the app, thru their contact form on their website, or the generic support email address. Simply put, I am disappointed in the way this company has handled my cancellation and I am now out a hundred bucks.	positive
82	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	I don‚Äôt usually leave comments regarding apps or internet sites but just had to for NOOM. It‚Äôs only been a week but I can see why they have such great success. The approach is completely different from any others. They seem to really care about your progress and let you know that they are there for you by giving you one on one contact with a personal coach and others who actually follow up at least once a week to help you along the way. The online portion of the program is presented in a simple format that incorporates tutorials that are very easy to understand but very insightful. They help you to figure out what got you where you are today. Then they give you the tools to slowly make the changes in your day to day living to pull yourself out of the rut you may be in. They show you how to move on while avoiding the same old habits that created the rut in the first place. And they do it all while motivating you with a splash of humor that allows you to do this without the self recriminations that often accompany a person when they are just ‚Äòdieting‚Äô. I am really excited about this program and look forward to working with NOOM to ultimately reach my final goals.	positive
83	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	"I‚Äôve struggled with my weight all of my adult life. I‚Äôve tried many other programs, with no real long-term success. I do believe that is because other programs do not address your true relationship with food. Enter Noom! Noom projected I would lose the 30 pounds (my ultimate goal) within 4 months by following their program. I ate regular everyday foods, stayed within the nutritional ‚Äúcolor ranges‚Äù, got my steps in everyday, and did the 10 minutes of daily readings that help change your relationship with food. And POOF! Just like magic, the 30 pounds was gone in just 4 months!
Noom has taught me how to find true balance in all areas of my life, and my Goal specialist has been instrumental in my successes. ( She checks in with me 1-2 times per week). I am forever a changed person, and a happier person.
I am now at goal weight and will indefinitely continue to subscribe to Noom for the daily readings, my relationship with my goal specialist, and the accountability it has given me for making sure I am treating myself well.
At the beginning of this program, I honestly thought it was ‚Äúa lot of money‚Äù. But honestly, when I look at how I have changed on the INSIDE as well as the outside, I‚Äôm WORTH the money...and so are YOU!"	positive
84	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	I really like this program. At my age, I have been on just about every diet created. They all work but the weight comes back and then some. Most of us know how to lose weight. What we can‚Äôt seem to do is change the behaviors that keep us addicted to overeating. Noom focuses on behavior and little bit by little bit changing behaviors.  This a journey and marathon vs a quick fix. The program helps us understand that when we slip into old eating patterns, it‚Äôs just a bump in the journey not the end of it. I highly recommend Noom. The group you are assigned to can be a lifeline. I love my group. It‚Äôs people going through the same thing that I am. When one of us is struggling, everyone encourages. And when I am doing great, I can encourage someone else who is struggling. I think the group is one of the biggest factors in my persevering this time. I‚Äôm starting week 9 and have lost 14 pounds. I have a ways to go before I‚Äôm at goal. Remember, this is not a lose weight quick program. It‚Äôs a lose weight in a healthy way while changing behaviors program. I truly do not feel like I‚Äôve had to sacrifice on this program and it‚Äôs something I can see me doing throughout the rest of my life.	positive
85	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	"Update. I have now lost 6 pounds in 6 weeks. Slow, but I am more concerned with being healthy long-term than I am with speedy weight loss.  I dine out a lot at restaurants and parties and nobody can even tell I am nooming until I tell them because nothing is off limits!

I am 56 years old and very healthy except I was about 15 pounds  overweight. I was looking for something to help me change my poor eating habits and remind me to exercise more (and not a diet) and that is exactly what Noom does.  I make healthier food choices and I exercise more due to the accountability the app provides. I do not use the Goal Specialist or the group to which I was assigned. I basically only use the food logging and exercise logging.  I do like how the app provides a small amount of nutrition information and tips every day. By getting it in small amounts over a long period of time, it is much easier to absorb.  I also like that no food or drink is off limits because I feel that is unrealistic.  I have been using it for 4 weeks and I have lost 5 pounds. My plan is to use it for a year. After I lose 10 more pounds I am going to continue to use it for maintenance. Hopefully after one year the good habits will be ingrained."	positive
86	634598719	health_and_fitness	2	First, let me say that I did lose weight. I lost about 10lbs. However, the app AND ‚Äúsupport‚Äù does not live up to the promises. The coaching and goal-setting were the main reasons I signed up and I felt like the coaching was minimal and they did not help set SMART goals or have any way of tracking them. The group coaches did NOT keep people engaged and did not do a very good job of explaining how to use certain features. Overall, the coaching was poor. For the money, which is about the same as weight watchers, I expected more. There are a ton of free apps that allow you to track macronutrients and activity, this was no different. I also felt like there was a bit of information overload with the coursework. I have PhD level education and with a typical ‚Äúbusy mom‚Äù lifestyle it was a tad time intensive and was a lot of information to try to retain over a short period. All of that aside, the part that really bothered me was the auto-renewal. When I side up it seemed if i would have only the initial 12-14 weeks and that if I wanted to continue, which I didn‚Äôt, I would have the opportunity to self-renew. I really despise programs like this that even have an auto renew as the default. It‚Äôs really dishonest and I feel like i should have been given my money back for the auto renewal period, which I did not use. I was not. Over all I would advise anyone to proceed with caution.	negative
87	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	I started Noom 19 weeks ago not really knowing what to expect.   To say I am extremely thankful to The Noom creators would be an understatement.  I have met my goal weight of losing 30 lbs but the best thing I can share is that while they had me looking at what I was doing to gain weight and how I was going to react to unexpected moments of food, they helped me look at other aspects of my life to the why I was doing what I did.   Pre-NOOM, I was having anxiety attacks and blood sugar surges.  Now I haven‚Äôt had any attacks since I began the program and the blood sugar surges are non existent.    Noom helped me face some inner issues and learn how to handle everyday stresses that would cause me to mindlessly eat.   I would highly recommend the Noom program and urge you to be active in discussions and sharing the ups and downs of your journey.   Don‚Äôt be discouraged if you have a minor weight gain, just acknowledge it and move forward with the knowledge that it‚Äôs ok.   It happens even in the best of times.  I also loved that I could eat anything as long as I was careful to count it in my calories.   I feel the best I have felt in 19 years because I am not I overweight.   Noom has been a phenomenal tool for me!  I am now a Skilled Master Noomie!	positive
88	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	"So far I‚Äôve really loved this program! It‚Äôs approachable and easy to use! And every goal is a small change that is easy to make and builds toward bigger changes. They address nutrition and psychology, the emotions behind the habits, tricks to change our habits, and work on making long term changes that stick! It‚Äôs about sustainable weight loss. And instead of feeling deprived, you learn to truly enjoy the foods you love without a guilt trip or punishing yourself. 
I used to think ‚Äúeverything in moderation‚Äù was a brilliant idea but impossible and that I would never be capable of healthy moderation. I was making all healthy choices or all lousy choices and I thought those were my only realistic options. But this is the right tool to get there! It teaches you to enjoy things you like to eat without falling face first in a gallon of it. It‚Äôs everything you need to correct what was wrong with every other weight loss attempt of you life that didn‚Äôt work. This app is doing it right! 
Healthy moderation, easy-to-follow nutrition, group support and inspiration, and insights into what emotions, choices, and habits need improvement to get from where we are to where we want to be. It‚Äôs just brilliant."	positive
89	634598719	health_and_fitness	1	"I‚Äôm not blaming the app for only losing 1 lb over 5 weeks. I have been eating less than 1500 calories balanced meals and exercising as much as I can with arthritis. The lessons seem abstract and difficult to follow. The lessons are campy as written almost just to be different. Lessons could be less abstract and written in plain language but then again it would be difficult for Noom to charge $179 for a straight forward program with easy to understand language. You could get better value with weight watchers. I‚Äôve been dieting smartly and have not deviated from my guidelines. I read the lessons thoroughly but get little from them. I don‚Äôt feel the app is doing anything that I‚Äôm not already doing myself. Again I‚Äôm not blaming the app. I think the testimonials are over inflated.  I won‚Äôt renew.

UPDATE:I was thrown off the app by the coach. I posted a not so stellar review in the App Store not the group 2 weeks ago not blaming anyone and was contacted by support asking what I they could to resolve this. After two emails requesting a refund I received no response. I posted my my displeasure in my group today and was immediately thrown out of the group. I did not quit and I would have continued if I didn‚Äôt receive a refund of $179 or a partial refund. Don‚Äôt ever get involved with this app. Their administration is horrible and their not willing to meet you halfway. I will continue to post my review as often as I can"	positive
90	634598719	health_and_fitness	1	"As others have stated, you don‚Äôt get full access until you pay the $129 or other steep fees. The sign up process is purposely confusing, and unlike other apps, you don‚Äôt have a subscription that you can easily cancel from your iTunes or Google Play subscription list. I was committed, though, and paid $129 for 4 months. Unfortunately, as others said, they mark certain high-calorie foods RED even though they let you say fuller far longer, and the Coach is nonexistent, aka, responded once or twice in three months to what I actually said, and messaged only every couple of weeks. A joke. My guess is that it‚Äôs a bot. The company has a D rating from the BBB & its only customer service is a phone # that ‚Äútries to connect to Google Voice‚Äù when you try to call because (my best guess) the company is based abroad and its US presence is not fully realized, and thus not subject to our laws?
A true disappointment. I was charged an additional $129 for a second four months despite canceling and am disputing the charge through my credit card company. Pity those who provided their debit card numbers. At best, they have purposely deceptive practices; at worse, they‚Äôre illegally and knowingly fleecing customers and do not provide the full services they pay for. I‚Äôm astonished they don‚Äôt have more negative reviews, as they‚Äôre freely available elsewhere online."	positive
91	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	"I was skeptical about Noom. I‚Äôm a pretty healthy eater, so I didn‚Äôt think it would teach me much. But I was really struggling to lose weight, so I decided to do the two week trial, and lost 4 lbs! Now I‚Äôm one month in, and I‚Äôve lost 8 lbs. More importantly, I feel like I can sustain the changes I‚Äôm making to keep the weight off.
I have one specific complaint about the app:
The flow for logging your food and seeing your calorie distribution is annoying. A big part of Noom is not only staying under your calorie budget, but also eating the right amounts of red/yellow/green foods. So I will often plan a meal before I eat it, to make sure it‚Äôs in budget. But the flow is cumbersome. I wish they‚Äôd change two things:
1) let me tap the calorie bar at the top of the screen to go straight to the ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù screen. That way I can quickly see my green/yellow/red budget.
2) if I‚Äôm logging a meal and hit back/close, take me back to the meal selection screen (instead of all the way back to the daily to-do list). OR EVEN BETTER, make it possible to get to the analysis screen when I‚Äôm logging a meal. When I‚Äôm trying to plan a meal that‚Äôs in-budget, it‚Äôs annoying to have to go through so many steps to check my budget."	positive
92	634598719	health_and_fitness	2	"I liked Noom at first. But realistically, the articles get repetitive. My ‚Äúcoach‚Äù who was supposed to help me set weekly goals was MIA a lot of the time. In four months I set 2 weekly goals. I requested another coach and did receive one, but by the time that happened I was less than enthused about the program. And when the new coach explained how often she‚Äôd be in contact and still didn‚Äôt have direct suggestions, I mentally checked out.

I‚Äôd still give the app three or four stars if it wasn‚Äôt for how terrible the food logging is. The calories were wrong for almost every food I scanned, which makes me question the accuracy of the ones I didn‚Äôt scan. And despite months of sending in emails and checking off the box for wrong calories, not a single food I ate on a regular basis was ever fixed. And sometimes the portion sizes were ridiculous. Cup of jam? Who eats a cup of jam? Teaspoon wasn‚Äôt even an option. Finally, their weight loss program is designed around choosing the proper amount of red, yellow, and green foods, with the colors determined by caloric density. Which sounds great on paper. Until you have different flavors of the same item. One Mamma Chia was green, another flavor was red. Same calories and same ounces. So same density. But one is in the unlimited category and the other in the severely limit category???? How????"	negative
93	634598719	health_and_fitness	1	Honestly I‚Äôm disappointed. I‚Äôm fairly in shape and was looking to loose 10-15lbs to feel more myself I exercise regularly just have gotten a bit out of shape due to office life so I figured this app/program would be great support in doing so and provide that extra push I needed.  The app itself is fine, the program itself is nothing new and I rather like the green,yellow, red food monitoring system. Where I feel let down is my coach and group. The group is so annoying, supposedly you‚Äôre put in a group with people with similar goals and habits. My group is not even close to that it‚Äôs a bunch of people complaining about what they can/can‚Äôt eat and bragging about walking a mile a day.... With my group being a bust, I was really hoping that maybe my coach would provide some candid feedback and support on this journey. Multiple times I‚Äôve reached out about how frustrated I was about my scale not moving much(I have lost 5lbs over 2 months), and her advise was to focus on other signs of weight loss... after I quit my subscription and again told her I was frustrated she finally asked if she could give me feedback on what I had been logging and why my scale might not be moving as much as I want.... yes lady that is why I signed up for this aren‚Äôt you just suppose to be doing that? Maybe I didn‚Äôt read enough on this before joining but based on all the hype and great reviews I was expecting more.	positive
94	634598719	health_and_fitness	1	"This app is for those who want to lose a little weight but aren't in any rush. By that I mean if it took 6 months to take a little more than a few inches off they'd be okay. If you're looking for a decent amount of results for all of the hectic and unnecessary work they make you do then this isn't for you. For starters, I was already suspicious about the fact that bad reviews had five stars. In other words, they're paying to have people's reviews changed. There's no way so many bad reviewers messed up and didn't realize they hit five stars. Not bashing just saying what I'm seeing. As for my experience with the app, first few days I didn't even talk to my ""team"" that they push so hard for you to keep updating. Want to know why I didn't update them? 1.Because they rarely respond, 2. ""They"" is only one person. My second issue, the FAQ section is either in dire need of updating or its purposely misleading. The app doesn't even look like the visuals they use to help you. Support is a long cue of unanswered automated robots. If you decide to do the trial, make sure you have a quick way of unsubscribing. My guess is that they're just making it hard so they can get your money. The company has a great concept, they just weren't ready for so much success in such little time. Now everything seems jumbled and unprofessional. I was rooting for them hoping I was simply paranoid."	negative
95	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	"I‚Äôve been struggling with my weight for the past six years since Mean-o-pause played havoc with my metabolism.  I gained over 30 lbs and couldn‚Äôt get it off.  I‚Äôd try diets and loose 5-10 lbs and then gain it back plus a few more.  This was recommended to me in an online chat.  What the heck, I‚Äôve tried everything else.  To be straight with you, this is not a diet pill that will get you to drop 30 pounds in 3 months. I lost 20 in about 5 months.  I set my rate to turtle ( you can set your rate of weight loss on the app from very slow to rapid) .  Having experienced yo-yo dieting I know about 1/2 pound per week is the most sustainable. The articles are science based, referenced, and interesting.  They get to the real root of the problem, what‚Äôs in your head.  This is hard work, I won‚Äôt kid you.  This is about changing yourself from the inside out. Changing your relationship with food, yourself, your lifestyle.  
The coaches are great.  They are there for encouragement, to answer any questions, give you tips.  They won‚Äôt take you to the gym and make you work out.  

I‚Äôm very happy I tried Noom and will continue to use the free app to track my weight and log my meals."	positive
96	634598719	health_and_fitness	2	I‚Äôve used the MyNetDiary app off and on for a couple of years.  When it was time to start tracking again and take off holiday weight, I thought I would try the Noom app I had heard so much about.  The very first food I scanned into the app was listed incorrectly.  I found that to be true with many of the scanned foods.  Building recipes to log was cumbersome.  The main reason I wanted to join was the personal coaching and groups I had heard so much about. I heard from my personal coach two times in a week and a half. The second was because I had asked a question.  I asked another question yesterday morning, but have not received a reply back. As for the group support, you don‚Äôt get entered into a group until the third week.  Also, this app says it will sync with your iPhone Health App, but it‚Äôs limited.  It will not write nutritional information to your health app, like MyNetDiary does.  This is way too expensive for what I was getting in return.  Some people said they had trouble canceling their subscription.  You have to use the app, tap on the blue text bubble to send a cancel request to your coach.  I immediately received an automated message back saying it looked like I wanted to cancel and they would reduce my subscription to $19 a month if I would stay.  I canceled anyway.  I just don‚Äôt like the app.	positive
97	634598719	health_and_fitness	3	I found this program to be very helpful for about six weeks, but after that it seemed repetitive and lacking in the area of tracking growth and progress. The coaching was not at all helpful, and the groups were not as active/supportive as I would have hoped - just a bunch of twee housemoms regurgitating get-healthy cliches. I can imagine most of them identify strongly with the classic stock photo, ‚ÄúWoman Smiling Over Salad‚Äù. My biggest issue with this program is the oversimplification of food - it‚Äôs either green, yellow or red. There is no way to track macros, which is pretty freaking important to do if you‚Äôre trying to lose significant weight, because your body won‚Äôt get the point unless you‚Äôre feeding it the right amount of protein, carbs and fats for your body weight. Once I started tracking my macros in another app, my metabolism finally kicked into high gear. I‚Äôm not mad that I started with noom, because as I said, it WAS useful for a minute, but I wish I had known more about the structure of the program before buying an 8-month subscription, which they refuse to let me donate to someone who may need it more. Also, the harassing texts to sign back in after I have asked multiple times to have alerts turned off, is getting pretty freaking annoying.	positive
98	634598719	health_and_fitness	5	I gained 80 pounds over a course of years. In 2005 I gained and lost 50 lbs. I didn‚Äôt start gaining again till 2011 and saw each year I‚Äôd put on 10-12 lbs each year. Being in my sixties I was assured it was normal. Okay, I can put up with 30 lbs or so but as the years click by it was relentless no matter what I did. Until this year 2019. This year being some 80# over weight I was getting desperate. I was looking at Cool Sculpting and other such remedies. Obviously I needed help. I saw the Noom App advertised for weeks and thought there‚Äôs no way an App was going to help, obviously, I‚Äôm a hard case and needed something professional. One night like mindlessly watching informercials I read the information on this tiny App and decided to give a try. After all they were offering a 30 day free trail. If I didn‚Äôt like it or it didn‚Äôt work like they said they would refund my money. I started March 1, 2019, today is March 30th and I‚Äôve lost 20 pounds as of this morning. The information and support you get is better than any other program out there unless you spend 10 x as much. Try it please. If you follow the program I‚Äôm sure it will work for you.	positive
99	634598719	health_and_fitness	4	"I love Noom. I lost 13 lbs more than my goal and have kept it off for over three months so far. The program provides support, its educational, the writers are funny and entertaining. I love the quizzes and daily reading.  I learned a lot about food, my triggers and some of the science behind the what and why.  I also appreciate the understanding that we are human, not perfect and sometimes we go off track, which makes it easier to get back to it because it teaches you to forgive yourself. There is no weight shaming or comparisons to you with others. I learned that I was the only barrier to my success, and once Noom helped me understand why I got in my own way, I was able to push through and reach my goals.  I am not dieting, I no longer need to because I changed my relationship with food, and it‚Äôs no longer the toxic relationship I was always running from - that always caught up to me and pulled back down. Thank you for helping me change my life! 

My only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn‚Äôt allow me to refer others since my 6 month program ended. I have referred 5 people since then. I am a walking advertisement for Noom and would like some credit for it üòä"	positive
100	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	"I wanted to start running again since i used to in highschool and needed an app to track my progress as well as monitor my vitals/pace.  I would say im a novice runner.  Ive been using the NRC app for about two months now and I really like it!  Its tracks most of the important stats (especially when linked to fitness monitor in my case AW4). Keeps me accountable! and theres a bunch of different challenges and achievements to unlock if you are that kind of person.#goals I love them personally. It makes me want to run more and more. I cant say i love it since for some reason the new Cadence monitoring feature isnt working for me. I figured it would sync with my applewatch for cadence but i guess not. Ive resorted to using the built in ""outdoor run"" under activity app to track cadence among other things and compare both apps after.  Little extra work but i dont mind.  All in all great app to track your progress and keep you accountable, the guided workouts are probably amazing but ive never used them.   Give this app a try, if you are using it with a fitness  tracker, setup app and device properly! or you will end up with missing info.
Only other gripe is sometimes it doesnt show my heart rate throughout run. It does on my other app so in not worrying too much, could be since im running both apps at same time to track my vitals."	positive
101	387771637	health_and_fitness	4	On Oct 31, I ran 8.1 miles to reach the 100 km goal for the month.  As usual, I started the run on my Apple watch 3, so I could monitor heart rate and pace. I wear my iPhone X in a Nike armband for GPS. At the end of the run, it never synced back to my phone: usually just a few minutes after I finish a run on my watch with my iPhone with me, the run will show up in the NRC app on my phone so I can apply it to my running plan, and enter my effort, where, and notes.  It never showed up in my iPhone NRC app, so it looks like I did not complete the October 100km challenge. I called them about it, and they said it was a known bug, they were working on it, and would be in touch with me in a few days.  Today, I held the phone in a hand strap case so I could use the phone screen easily. I did a QuickStart Run (warmup), then a Speed Run (6x400m), and then ran home with another QuickStart run. For all 3, I had NRC open on my watch and phone, but _started_ the run on my phone, which in turn started the run on my watch!  This way, I could see ongoing heart rate on both devices, and could push the Lap button on my phone at the end of the 400m reps.  I do prefer being able to simply Start a run from my watch and Apply it to the Plan later on my phone, but for now, this is a work-around.	positive
102	387771637	health_and_fitness	1	"I suppose if you‚Äôre a casual runner of shorter distances this app is serviceable. If you‚Äôre even slightly more serious, read on.

I have an Apple Watch Nike+ S2 and the Watch app is absolutely horrible. Laggy all around. Every swipe takes a second to register, every tap happens a second later. Tapping to start a run takes seconds to actually begin. If you have a run countdown and the countdown does not complete before you drop your wrist the workout will not actually begin. Double tapping the screen during a run is supposed to pause your workout but you have to raise your wrist to wake the screen and then give it a few seconds to update the display before you can do so. Even then it can take a couple of attempts. And last but certainly not least if you finish a long workout (double digit miles) and attempt to save the workout the app crashes. If you restart the app it resumes the workout forcing you to pause the workout (adding time to your workout in the process) and try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it terminates and saves nothing. Yesterday I lost a 19 mile run. Gone. It‚Äôs far from the first time and I‚Äôm not going to go through it anymore.

I have given this app too many chances over years of it getting worse. I‚Äôm embarrassed to have pre-ordered the Apple Watch Nike+ S3. Even when it comes I will absolutely not be giving this app another chance. If you‚Äôve read this far, consider yourself warned."	negative
103	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	Hey my name is Danny, but I go by ‚Äúcommander daddy‚Äù I have been using this app for years. I‚Äôve always been going on runs and eventually decided I should figure out a way to track my miles. I stumbled onto this app early on. So as time went on and I continued running I eventually would post my runs to my Instagram, and eventually found out I had some friends who ran as well. We were able to share our miles and times which was cool to us. Then just before the new year was coming up I decided to make a challenge for my friends to participate in. The challenge was run 365 miles in a year. It‚Äôs not a crazy challenge for the average to everyday runner, however that‚Äôs not what I can categorize any of my friends as. They all have full time jobs and we‚Äôre are all athletes in other categories (skaters, climbers, fighters, etc). So anyways, everyone joined and we‚Äôve been running and tracking even harder ever since. It‚Äôs even become pretty competitive which is my favorite part. I think if you got a friend group even if you wouldn‚Äôt call yourself a runner you should download this app and try it. It‚Äôs good for growth of all kinds. Oh and now after this is all said and done I think I am considerably a runner.	positive
104	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	"I love how it‚Äôs been helping me train for my first 10k! It adjusts its workout to meet me where I‚Äôm at in my running experience which is really nice. 
A few things I wish they‚Äôd improve on:
1. Explaining their workouts a little. For example today I needed to run 4 intervals of 400m however I just had the workout going the entire time in between. I wasn‚Äôt informed that I needed to pause the workout in between intervals so by the time I was done it looked like I only completed 1 interval.
2. There are still some glitches they need to work through. There have been multiple times when I‚Äôve gotten on the app and gone to where my ‚Äúcoach‚Äù should be for my 10k training and nothing is there so all of my training has disappeared and there‚Äôs no evidence of it ever happening. Typically if I exit the app and try again 30 mins later my training will show up again. However I didn‚Äôt know that the first time it happened so I just started a whole new training plan which was a little frustrating. 
3. Sometimes I‚Äôll begin one of the scheduled workouts but when I finish it, it log it in/ appear as if I completed or even started it from the weekly overview screen. So if I want my plan to be marked as completed that day I‚Äôll have to manually go back and add another workout simply enter in my progress from the workout I just did."	positive
105	387771637	health_and_fitness	1	"Update after update Nike is adding useless features yet they still can‚Äôt make this app work properly on an Apple Watch. Ridiculous that this app is still an ‚ÄúEditors Choice‚Äù to boot when it‚Äôs just simply NOT WORKING! Same annoying problems as months ago when I last used it. Not synchronizing with my iPhone so my runs are lost, ending the tracking of a run in the middle of it, stopping and restarting the tracking of a run in the middle of it for no reason, not responding when trying to stop a run upon completion... Yes, it‚Äôs still complete and hopeless garbage. I‚Äôm amazed that so many other users seem to have similar problems yet the developers of this app still can‚Äôt find their way out of a paper bag and have it work properly on an Apple Watch. I‚Äôm also surprised that this app gets decent reviews. Are all those positive reviews fake? Come on, if it‚Äôs not synchronizing with your iPhone and you‚Äôre loosing the data relating to your runs, it‚Äôs just not working and it deserves ZERO stars, not even one star. 

Fortunately, I also rely on my Apple Workouts app so I can still track my activities even when the Nike Run app malfunctions. Given that the Apple Workout app has gotten better over time in terms of the features and analytics it offers, and is stable as a rock, I‚Äôm going to switch completely to it. No more frustration in dealing with this ridiculous piece of Nike garbage and, big bonus, I‚Äôm going to be freeing up 700MB of storage space."	negative
106	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	I‚Äôve been using this app before it was called Nike Run Club. I love it and it‚Äôs part of my daily routine. That being said there are some serious problems with the app that have sprung up. The Facebook cheers feature which many people have actively reported as not working still hasn‚Äôt been fixed after years of not working. But that‚Äôs not my major problem with the app. The guided runs usually involve this guy called ‚ÄúNike Global Head Coach Bennet.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think Nike could have picked a worse person for this job. His voice sounds like a high schooler trying his best to sound like a cool adult, and he is constantly speaking in this strange cadence and trying to deepen his voice to sound more inspirational. He says the most scripted, cheesy, lame uninspiring things completely taking me out of the zone. All this ‚Äúyou‚Äôre awesome, you‚Äôre already so great, and you‚Äôre getting better with every step you take‚Äù gets old really fast and is no way to motivate you to get better. If I‚Äôm already awesome why am I running? Please Nike, get us a mature, intelligent and charismatic guide to get us through our runs. Something actually inspiring and epic, not this drab, monotone mess. (Sorry Bennet.) You know who was awesome? Eliud. That voice and run was amazing, UNTIL coach Bennet had to come in and say something pointless. Ugh I‚Äôm done.	positive
107	387771637	health_and_fitness	2	"This app has everything to be hands down the best running app out there. However, starting the app on your phone won‚Äôt track your distance unless your phone is on you, EVEN IF you‚Äôre wearing your watch. Apple Watch S3 was designed with one of their main focus being phone-free workouts (Keep reading). 
Now, you can start the app on the watch without a phone BUT if you don‚Äôt have the AirPods, you won‚Äôt be able to hear anything while running, not mentioning you won‚Äôt be able to listen to music either unless, you know, buy wireless headphones. *** ****
To add on, when running the treadmill I like to put my phone on the dashboard so I can look at it while I run and keep my eye on my stats BUT this won‚Äôt track my distance because again, even though I‚Äôm wearing the watch the phone needs to be held in my hand or be strapped on my arm. 
I then start the run on my watch and WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I OPEN THE APP ON THE PHONE TO LOOK AT MY STATS? I get a message saying opening the phone app while the watch app is in use will start a separate run. Can‚Äôt win. I know the stats will display on the watch but having your phone in front of you is better stuff.
About every single running app in the App Store will let you use both your watch and phone as one and use the watch as tracking device whether the app was started on the phone or watch. Please listen and make an improvement üôèüèº"	positive
108	387771637	health_and_fitness	4	"I‚Äôve used the Nike+ when it was a sensor on my shoe in 2009. Now, I‚Äôve upgraded to the Apple 3 watch and iPhone8. The NRC app has worked well over the years and haven‚Äôt had any problems with the latest app upgrade. However, I‚Äôm have difficulties with my last run syncing to my phone and watch. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone is experiencing the same problem after the latest updates for Apple. 

My NRC phone and watch apps have my last run on Wednesday for 5 miles. I performed the OS update on Friday for my phone and watch. Saturday, I ran 9.30 miles with my watch. The app was working fine and recorded my run details and heart beat. I closed my watch rings for Move and Exercise and it recorded my run with NRC on my workout log. 

I tried to sync the run with my phone and nothing updated expect the update time. I‚Äôve tried rebooting each device, deleting and adding the app, and checking the settings. Nothing seems to work. I‚Äôm glad my phone‚Äôs Health and watch Activity apps recorded my run.  But I‚Äôm missing out on completing my Weekly NRC Challenge and record of my run. I hope it gets resolved soon since I have a half marathon coming up and would like to use my watch and not my phone on my race. Thank you for your time."	positive
109	387771637	health_and_fitness	4	"I‚Äôve been running since middle school and I always used Running2Win to log my runs, but since that site is a bit clunky and the app is garbage, I figured I‚Äôd try this one out. Since I‚Äôve been using it, I‚Äôve fallen in love with the UI and how easy the app is to use. The workouts from the ‚ÄúMy Coach‚Äù seem a bit easy, so I do my own and just substitute them, but otherwise the runs are great. I especially like the guided runs because it actually feels like someone is beside me and running with me, which is always a nice feeling when running alone when back from school. 

However, this app is not without some minor bugs, most notably in the guided runs themselves. For whatever reason and on multiple occasions, the guided run will simply stop and stay frozen at a certain time (usually 4‚Äô37‚Äù when I use it). While it could be written off as a problem deriving from another issue, I have an XS so it definitely shouldn‚Äôt be a hardware issue. Like I said, I really like the guided runs, but when they stop 4 minutes in, it gets a little annoying. Otherwise, pretty great app that I would recommend to people just getting into running or seasoned runners looking for an easy way to log runs (and keep track of shoe mileage)!"	positive
110	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	I love running, I believe in what Nike stood for, from its humble beginnings until now. A run is about being just a little bit better then you were the day before, it‚Äôs about freedom. About leaving stress, or the things that ‚Äúbog‚Äù you down behind. At least for that little bit of time you‚Äôre running. I feel like those statements also hold true for this app. The app is better then it was, and I believe it will continue to be better. In the future however I want to see the interface be more intuitive, less ‚Äúbogged‚Äù down. I want the freedom of what a run feels like to translate into this app. I love the coach runs, I love the podcasts with coach Bennet. I love the challenges. Running is about the individual and as soon as I log Into this app the center of it all should be about me/ the individual. Then secondly: intuitively be more apart of my friends running. One example is, I would like to see their run color, and be more interactive with them (I do like the ‚Äúcheering on‚Äù) and their trophy‚Äôs. Also I definitely want to see the run club be more local. Or be able to set up a run club meet locally through the app. I have a love hate relationship with this app, I have a billion ideas for this thing, but totally have faith that they will get it right. That it will be better tomorrow then it is today.	positive
111	387771637	health_and_fitness	2	I am a four year user of this app and I use it only on the iPhone (currently iPhone XS on iOS 13.2) not the Apple Watch.  Starting with the update to version 6.2, the app has been recording dramatically longer distances than reality.  I run the same routes frequently, and I have been recording runs with NRC, Strava, Endomondo, and RunGo over the years, and I know exactly how long each neighborhood route I run is.  NRC is now recording tracks that are approximately 15% to 20% too long.  An 8.5 km route this morning got recorded as 10.1 km by NRC. This weekend, I ran 21.1 km (not in a race) and NRC recorded 24.3 km. This completely destroys my pace calculations and I‚Äôm sure is not helping my NRC marathon training plan to adjust properly.  My other trackers do not have this problem.  When I look at the NRC GPS tracks, they are crazy jagged, looking like I am crossing the street back and forth every few meters, running into the middle of a house and back out to the street, etc. On all my other trackers, I can tell the side of the street I was on, and the tracks are nice and smooth.  If I run down the sidewalk, the GPS track looks like I‚Äôm running down the sidewalk. With NRC it‚Äôs like every GPS datapoint can be randomly 5 to 10 meters off from my real location and it makes me look like I was staggering drunk.  This all began with the upgrade to 6.2.  Please fix ASAP.	positive
112	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	This is still my favorite running app, by far. The old version of the app was still slightly better for me though. Nike fixed the issue with controlling music & the app from the headphone controls, which was my biggest pet peeve (this worked fine in older versions of the app, but was broken when the app went to version 4. The only remaining issue for me is that the app doesn‚Äôt handle music correctly if you are listening to another audio source before a run. I like to listen to audio books & podcasts in the car (I use the audible and downcast apps, not the official apple ones, maybe that‚Äôs part of the issue, I don‚Äôt know), but even though my music choice for the run is set to an iTunes playlist, it continues to play the audiobook/ podcast I was listening to in the car. The old versions (up to 3.x) handled this correctly, starting the iTunes playlist as soon as the run started. Not a complete deal killer, but it sure would be nice if they fixed that. Aside from that issue, it‚Äôs a great app. I‚Äôve been using it since 2006 (when it only worked on the iPod nano, and it still works great for my needs.	positive
113	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	I am very disappointed with my first experiences with Nike+. I just purchased an Apple Watch for the sole purpose of tracking my runs through the MapMyRun app training plans. The Apple Watch didn‚Äôt support using the training plans with the watch alone so I decided to give Nike+ a try assuming it would work seamlessly on the Apple Watch given that Nike is even part of the name of the Watch. I‚Äôve been very disappointed. First, moving from MapMyRun to Nike+ means loosing over 1300 miles of runs tracked on MapMyRun. This is super disappointing to have to start brand new with a new app and not be able to transfer past workouts over. Second, I love MapMyRun‚Äôs training plan but I was willing to give Nike+ My Coach a try. The feature seems great BUT I cannot use My Coach without bringing my big bulky phone along on runs with me. This is a huge development oversight on the part of Nike. The entire reason I forked out $477 for a Watch was to be able to leave my phone at home. If you are a serious runner you are using My Coach and running at speed a and distances that are not conducive to lugging around a bulky phone with you. For this reason alone I drop my rating of Nike+ from 5 to 3 stars. I‚Äôd love to love the app if you corrected these issues.	positive
114	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	I love Nike‚Äôs coaching program which helps me train for my half marathon. But there are two things I‚Äôm not happy about. One is a glitch and the other was a flaw in how they decided to count the interval sprints. First the glitch is that the runs don‚Äôt actually apply to the run on that day even though you hit start from the coach section on that day. Instead the next week when it asks you if you want to adapt your plan in accordance with your level, it asks you to apply the runs to a day but they don‚Äôt belong on that week, they belong on the week prior but you no longer have access to that week to properly do so. The design flaw: used to when you had HIIT days where you ran 7 200 meter sprints with 2:45 minute breaks (for example), you hit ‚Äúpause‚Äù after you completed the interval and it started counting your break time so you knew exactly when you needed to start again. It no longer does that. Instead you have to hit ‚Äúlap‚Äù to count the interval and stop the distance tracking for that one interval and then hit pause so it won‚Äôt start tracking the next interval. It doesn‚Äôt count during your break and the phones time doesn‚Äôt always show at the top so you can‚Äôt keep track of that very well. Very poorly thought out. Please go back!	negative
115	387771637	health_and_fitness	2	"I‚Äôve been using this app for 2 years now. I got the new update yesterday. This morning, my run outside showed up like it does when you run on a treadmill. It didn‚Äôt use the GPS at all. I‚Äôve double checked all my settings, both location services and in the NRC app, to make sure they were fine. If anyone knows how to fix this, I would appreciate it. This is the main thing that may cause me to switch apps.

A review that I have been procrastinating on for a while has to do with the coach portion of the app. When I started using the app, to set up a program, you had 3 options. I don‚Äôt remember the exact options, but something like build up to race, keep your pace, and crush your pr. I would like to see these options again, because any my coach workouts I set up don‚Äôt push my pace as much as I would like them too. The tempo run of slowly increasing your pace with each mile has disappeared and it was one of my favorite workouts. I would also like to see an option where the schedule doesn‚Äôt adapt to you. I am just one of those runners who needs a solid schedule that doesn‚Äôt change if I have to miss a run.

All that being said, I don‚Äôt have an Apple Watch to comment on that portion. I have loved this app and will continue to use it if the map portion gets fixed."	positive
116	387771637	health_and_fitness	4	"I‚Äôve been a loyal Nike+ member forever. I run for the joy of it (and to crush a few races) so I‚Äôm not as picky as the most hard-core, Garmin-loving runners out there. I had to take some time off due to injury and recently discovered the guided run. I‚Äôve done several and they‚Äôre amazing (def try the headspace), but for me there‚Äôs a fatal flaw. Once the guided run is over, the tracker stops, which is a complete fail on 2 accounts: First, any runner knows that you don‚Äôt stop at 5.87 miles. And even if I go to six, it doesn‚Äôt count unless my watch says so. Plus, what if I was having an awesome run and wanted to keep going? Or I planned an hour run but the longest headspace is 50 min? Or what if I planned 4 miles but i ran slow and my guide cut out at 35 min? I track my shoe mileage, so all of those 0.13 miles will start to add up. (Doesn‚Äôt Nike want me to buy more shoes?) Second, it stops your music too. I generally go a little longer to cool down and it‚Äôs annoying to have to actually stop running and turn my music back on. If the tracker/music kept running after the guide stopped, this would be nearly perfect -especially on long or difficult runs. 

Please, Nike!!!!"	negative
117	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	I really want to like this app. I‚Äôve used Nike for tracking for over a decade. For the occasional runner it‚Äôs amazing. However, I‚Äôm now training for races and find it unreliable. I‚Äôve been using their ‚Äúcoach‚Äù plan to train for a marathon. Every time the plan wants me to use Nike‚Äôs training app as part of the plan it doesn‚Äôt sync and makes me update the NRC app. The app says it‚Äôs updated so I have to delete from my phone then reinstall. This has happened 4 times. This last time the update deleted my plan ENTIRELY. My run data is still there but the plan is gone and I can‚Äôt set up a new plan because my race is only 6 weeks away. I also find the Apple Watch app insufficient as I can‚Äôt begin a coach run from my plan in my watch. So if running intervals, I have to hold my phone in my hand and pause it manually when I see I‚Äôve hit the distance, (200 meters etc). It will not appear on my watch.  If I try to set a distance from the watch to match my plan and assign later, the plus and minus buttons move the distance at random distance and I can‚Äôt set it at exactly 10 miles for example. In summery the coach feature is awesome in theory and incredibly frustrating in practice. For everything else I find it to be a great tool.	positive
118	387771637	health_and_fitness	1	"This app and Apple Watch would be perfect if they were just a little more user friendly. I actually want to give this more stars but the squeaky wheel gets the grease. Here are my 2 recommendations 
1) Please show cumulative times next to splits in the post run analysis. Garmin does this and it is awesome! 2) Please make an easier way to instantly pause the clock. This could be an Apple issue but if there is anyway to add some functionality to the app so that the buttons on the side of the watch can control the timer users would be very happy. With a touch screen swiping, double tapping, or waiting 2 seconds are just not practical ways to stop a clock when you‚Äôre on a serious run. Most runners try not to stop at all but if you are in an urban environment cars and people appear out of nowhere and require a little skilled time management. GPS is also far from perfect so if doing a time trial on a track it is nice to focus on finishing the run at the finish line and knowing your time rather than trying get the touch screen to work properly. If any Nike app developers read this please understand that little convinces like this make a world of difference for runners. It just seems silly that we can still get more accuracy out of a $30 dollar stop watch than a GPS enabled smart watch. Please focus on the basics first."	positive
119	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	Been using Nike Plus Run for 4-5 years. In the past it has been a reliable app. Others will have more functionality to them or cooler graphics and stats, but where Nike always excelled was in its reliability. Always opened, always worked, never failed. Until recently that is. When running iOS 13 and having the latest version of the app the time it takes from when you hit stop at the end of a run until the run loaded up got longer. Like almost 10 seconds long. Long enough to wonder if it was going to capture the run. But it would capture it. But not today. I‚Äôm training for a half marathon in three weeks and today I pushed myself to run 13.1 miles to make sure I could do it. I felt fast, I felt healthy and I couldn‚Äôt wait for the end to see what my splits were and to share the results with my wife and some friends. I hit the ‚Äústop‚Äù run button and waited. And waited and waited and waited. Finally after 15 seconds or so I looked down and the app had crashed. When I opened it up again none of my current run data was there. Like the run had existed only in head. Extremely frustrating. Reliability was always something Nike had going for it and today even that failed	positive
120	387771637	health_and_fitness	1	"I don‚Äôt know why I keep giving Nike the benefit of the doubt thinking that this app will be improved after every update. It has not improved. My reason is because considering that this is a run TRAINING app, it‚Äôs coaching feature is worthless. 

I started the coach feature and chose the marathon, and my first 2 week experience has been horrible. There‚Äôs no way to start a training day through your Apple Watch, always you have to start it with your phone. After that, nothing shows up on your watch, you have to open the app on your watch to start syncing with your phone after starting it on your phone. After I ended a run, it never showed up that the run was even completed, I then have to manually enter it in through the activity page. Why does anybody have to take so many steps to make this feature work when it should only take 2 buttons to start and complete the task. I called it quits when I had to do a 4x400 sprint interval workout. No syncing on the watch so apparently Nike wants you to check your heart rate and progress while your phone sits in your sleeve or pocket. 

For anyone that wants to train, either experienced or beginner, I‚Äôm begging you, stay away from this app. You will have a less frustrating experience by getting tips from someone who doesn‚Äôt run."	negative
121	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	ok so this app is THE BEST app i‚Äôve ever downloaded and honestly changed my life. i‚Äôve been using this app for a month now and let me tell you i keep discovering new features and have yet to find a SINGLE FLAW. the app is super easy to use, and has a ton of extra features i‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt know you needed. it has lots of motivating factors, such as the run levels, which are a great initiative to keep going on regular runs. everyone loves to level up right? the guided runs (narrated by coach bennett my king) make it super easy to start and finish runs, with coach bennett cheering you on (and sometimes andy my other main man) and with the predetermined distance or duration, you know what to expect. you can also join in weekly or monthly challenges with the whole nike run club community and the in app shopping feature makes it easy to find and purchase shoes and other gear. i highly HIGHLY recommend this app if ur starting to run more seriously or just looking for a good tracking app for ur runs. GET THIS APP it‚Äôll blow you away with all its extra features, layout, and accessibility. 10/10!!!	positive
122	387771637	health_and_fitness	2	"I hope Nike and apple read this and look at fixing the issues. I have been consistently using the app for the last two months. While it works well most of time but if you are long distance runner and want to track more than 12 or 14 miles the app is becoming unreliable. Today was worst. I started the run in the watch waited for the count down and stared running. Good 7 or 8 mins into my run I check the watch only to find the watch showing me the time as though I didn‚Äôt start. I press the app again only to find the app simply spinning on watch. I pulled out the phone and the Nike app said you have a run in watch. At this point my rhythm is gone I stop trying to figure out what is happening. Finally started the app again on the phone and started running. Now Nike assumes I have a 3k goal. Luckily it didn‚Äôt stop after 3k. 
I lost 0.7 mile of the tracking. Lost my rhythm on run. Ended up running more than my goal(ok that‚Äôs fine) but dealing with a buggy app in the middle of the run is super frustrating. Nike, just do it...right. Until then I have to switch to something else. After spending to get a Nike Apple Watch I feel let down in trust and reliability.  
Hope you read this and sure you have access to my data and fix it."	positive
123	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	I have been using this app since 8 months now on my watch which is the Nike version. It fits almost all my needs. I have been having many problems though. From time to time when I start it, a couple minutes in it says it can not track any distance since some categories in the health app have not been switched on. When I got to look, they are on. Turning them on and off will not work. The only solution I have found is to delete and download it again. The app on the watch is slow to respond and makes me attack the screen with my finger to get it to work after a couple weeks after I've downloaded it again because of the prior bug. When it finally begins, it takes a little for it to actually start. The app takes for over to load when you try to look at it while you're on your run. The app has improved since I've been using it but the designers really need to work on it. The only other thing I wish they would add is a race mode which you could select a distance of your race and would help pace you and record your race. Beginning and ending can be very impractical. Besides that, it has almost all the features I need.	positive
124	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	This app- as a concept alone- is super cool. I am personally motivated by badges and I love some of the guided runs a lot. I was super excited to do the personalized coach, so I gave it a try for 3 weeks to see how it would go. During that time, I was frustrated by some pretty minor bugs (notifications not disappearing once I had opened them, music stopping and not being able to start back up because the pause button was frozen- little things like that) but even though there were quite a few of them, I decided that it wasn‚Äôt worth stopping for that and tried to be patient with those bugs. However, the weekly schedule (personally) was not customizable for me. If I couldn‚Äôt run on the last day of the scheduled week, that scheduled run didn‚Äôt transfer over to the next week- the schedule continued as though I had run it. Then I got sick for a week and the schedule just continued to move on as though I had been running the whole time. Things like that don‚Äôt motivate me to keep using the app because I feel like by it being *personalized* it should also be a little more customizable to make room for things in life that you don‚Äôt really expect to happen.	positive
125	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	"There are two things that keep this from being the perfect app for me. 
1. The inability to use a run in my history towards my training plan. For instance, I did a long run today that for some reason didn‚Äôt sync to my training plan, so according to the plan, I didn‚Äôt do the run despite it being in my history. If I add the run manually to the plan it will show up in my history twice and my monthly milage will be inaccurate, plus the frustration of knowing I ran but seeing this week as an incomplete in the training plan. There should be in option to add an existing run to the plan for that corresponding day. 

2. This isn‚Äôt as big of a deal, but the social media aspect of this app is far from perfect. With Run keeper your friends are automatically able to see your runs with all of the attached data-splits, milage, pace etc. Nike went for more of a social media approach where you can take a pic and make a post with your milage, pace, and avg time but anything else would have to be added in the caption. Not a huge deal but I vastly prefer Run Keeper where my friends can see all the details of my run automatically and there are no adds blocking up the feed"	positive
126	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôve had periods of running here and there for almost a decade and used NRC since at least 2013. However, what really got me locked on this app almost daily and thereby an amateur runner is its wonderful guided runs. Audio guided programming based on a wide range of topics, distances, run types, and times as well as a newbie running series has eased me into running in a way I‚Äôve never had before. The Headspace collab was also an amazing treat and helped me a lot last autumn when I was dealing with tough personal issues. Running became a safe haven in the day and made me love working out again. Turns out running is about the only workout to do outside during quarantine, too. I wish the social aspect was improved natively on app so that I can engage with friends without seeming like I‚Äôm bragging or being annoying on Facebook or Instagram. Also, the apple watch version of the app needs some more work, but the mobile experience has been very meaningful for me despite some minor problems. The my coach function I could do without. Otherwise, love love love this app.	positive
127	387771637	health_and_fitness	4	The map that shows you pacing is exactally what I needed and it does it‚Äôs job on a phone perfectly. I recently got an Apple Watch series 5 and I was excited to hear Nike Run club was integrated with it, but in reality it wasn‚Äôt. The only integration was an easier pathway to start a run. When on a run your time fades away to the watch face and real time, making it unnecessarily difficult to check your pacing, distance, and time of run. Also, it is impossible to hit a lap button to distinguish for your self the times and paces for workouts that you take rests on. Track workouts become a pain and you can‚Äôt stop the tracking of the watch and still see the time going if you want to be able to check your pace during the workout. If you have a series 5, the default Apple workout app is much better. While it does not have a lap function, it does keep the important running information available at all times. In the end, if you don‚Äôt have a series 5 Apple Watch, this is the App for you. If you do have the series 5, there is almost no use in downloading this app.	positive
128	387771637	health_and_fitness	2	"I‚Äôve run almost 1,000miles with this app and used to love it when running with my phone. I purchased the Apple Watch Series 2 Nike+ Edition specifically to use with this app because I loved it so much and wanted to continue using the app on the watch. Long story short, it crashes regularly and doesn‚Äôt log my run properly, if at all! The GPS is accurate for mileage but the integrated maps don‚Äôt show the actual route I took or it‚Äôs really skewed! I have no idea how that‚Äôs even possible. Additionally, it takes me a minimum of 5 tries to pause and stop a run from my watch! This morning I have it one more shot but it took me 45min and 10+ tries to end my run. Not sure why I persisted, but I did. My only assumption is that it works better on newer models of the Apple Watch. I won‚Äôt be using anymore on my watch.

As for using the app on my phone, I love it. Works well, very accurate, and doesn‚Äôt crash. No complaints about the app. Plus I love that it gives me incremental stats and pace and allows me to adjust it to suit my needs. Training plans are good and the other guided runs are fun to use sometimes, but I typically follow other run plans, so I‚Äôm no expert on the guided runs."	positive
129	387771637	health_and_fitness	2	"While I love the idea of all the features this app offers, it lets me down ALL the time. No matter if I record a run on my Apple Watch or my iPhone it is literally a flip of a coin if it‚Äôs going to track my run and sync with my plan! I am so frustrated with it. I ran 6 miles last week and started the run through my phone off my plan/coach page within the app. I just checked the app to look at my progress and it does not show that the run has been applied to my plan. So much for the app adjusting my plan based on my progress! I crushed my 6mile pace (9:07/mile) and the plan keeps telling me to run at a 12:43/mile pace. Just so over this!
Also, the phone app and watch app never work together. If I want to see my real time data while running I have to start the run on my watch but then I‚Äôm guaranteed that the run won‚Äôt sync with the plan on my phone. It makes no sense that the run options on the watch have nothing to do with the plan the phone app creates for you. It‚Äôd be really nice for things to talk to each other. I expect a lot more from Nike!!
Please correct these issues and make it more user friendly to have a training plan and get the credit for doing the runs."	positive
130	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	When I first downloaded this app, the thought of walking a mile seemed so intimidating. So, I did my first jab at it, half expecting to delete this app in a day or two when I eventually gave up. Guess what, it took me 26 minutes to walk a mile. I walked, huffed, puffed, and waited for the signal ‚Äúworkout complete‚Äù! I then googled how long an it SHOULD take. 16 mins for my age/gender is below average. It then became a challenge. Day 2, I pushed, huffed, puffed, and made it in 24 mins. Well, fast forward to just 4 weeks later and I am able to complete a mile in 17 mins. Now, this isn‚Äôt an extreme feat by any means, but this is progress. I have shaved 9 minutes off a mile in a month. I feel better, I have more confidence, I feel more achieved. This is the best app I‚Äôve ever downloaded & if you challenge yourself I would even label it life changing. Because of this app (& my own hard work!) I was able to enjoy a vacation with my family for the first time in years. I wasn‚Äôt afraid of my physical limitations and was able to truly enjoy myself.	positive
131	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	"I have had this app for awhile now. I was excited to use it for my new Apple Watch series 3 after having a Garmin Forerunner 220. I was contemplating if I should because I really wanted a good running watch that was accurate. After using it for awhile and testing my Garmin against the Apple Watch it was pretty much dead on and accurate. I‚Äôm really happy with it and recommend it to all serious runners. But there is one thing that bugs me a lot. And it‚Äôs the physical button to start a run. I know that the side button and crown are key parts of working the Apple Watch during apps but it would nice to just push the button instead of tapping the screen and hoping it started. This I think having the side button be would be fantastic. I know I‚Äôm not the only one who would like this. Adding a feature for splits during the run for track workouts would be awesome. If this was in the next app update or a little bit in the future I would appreciate it s lot. Other than that I think it is great! 

Thanks!"	positive
132	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	Have been using for 5 and 10K training since I was starting from scratch and had never run a race before. For the 5k I definitely over trained and ran more than the personalized plan that the app offers. I did very well for my first race and finished just over my goal. For my 10K I have yet to finish the training plan but have already beat the goal oh a e for my race next month. I definitely have followed the regime this go round and have realized my legs aren‚Äôt over trained and are fresher for each workout (lesson learned). I also love that the app keeps track of your personal PRs, lets you compare mileage to friends, and gives you challenges you can sign up for to push yourself and make the higher mileage more fun. Also the guided runs are nice and a great way to try something new and a new playlist you may not have considered before. I would definitely recommended this for beginners just getting started or even intermediate runners looking for a way to switch up their running and training.	positive
133	387771637	health_and_fitness	4	I‚Äôve been using this app for about 5 months now with my Apple Watch series 3 gps Watch. Everything works great when you are doing anywhere from 1-6 miles. Once you start getting past that it starts getting extremely slow announcing mileage and times. What usually takes 5 to 10 seconds now can take more than 2 minutes and while your running it is extremely annoying. ‚ÄúTime.........40.........2.........minutes........20.........5.......seconds......‚Äù and so on. It can be over a 10 to 15 second pause between each phrase while its calculating the time. Also it stops your workout automatically at times. Today while running I was pretty sure I had ran over a mile without an announcement then I look down and not calculating anymore. Go back it and start it again and it says ‚Äúbeginning workout‚Äù like it‚Äôs starting a new one when I had already ran 10 miles. Luckily it continued from where I left off but who knows how long the gap was between it stopping then starting again. I think I‚Äôll look for a new running app now.	positive
134	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	"On the iPhone, I can close the app completely (to save battery) if I need to pause/stop my workout, and then continue/resume it at a later time (without technically ‚Äòending‚Äô the workout), but I am unable to do that on the Apple Watch. 

In other words, if I walk a mile in the morning, then take a break, and then decide to walk another mile in the afternoon (and so on), I can close the app each time w/out ‚Äòending‚Äô my workout, and then reopen the app later when I want to continue my workout for more mileage. Therefore, I can accumulate all my miles in one day -3 miles total (instead of three separate miles for three separate workouts in one day). 

For some reason, no matter how many times I ‚Äòclose‚Äô or ‚Äòforce quit‚Äô the app on my watch, a few seconds later, it opens right back up on its own and insists on appearing in my screen all the time. I don‚Äôt want to keep it open all day, as it will wear my battery down.  I also don‚Äôt want to ‚Äòend‚Äô my workout each time and then start a new one. Can this be adjusted or fixed in the future, pretty, pretty please?! Thank you!"	positive
135	387771637	health_and_fitness	1	3 years ago this app was perfect. I used to carry my phone in my hand to track my runs through the app and it worked great. I enjoy the feeling of community that the app provides. I‚Äôve become a more serious runner and started using a Series 3 Apple Watch to run. For a while everything worked great but I found that sometimes I would look down at my watch to check my stats and it wouldn‚Äôt actually be tracking me at all even tho I know I started the run. Or I would pause the app and it would glitch and erase my run as I never was running. The issue that recurred the most would be I would finish my run and try to synch it to my phone and it would glitch and the run would be lost. I always keep my app updated and I‚Äôm currently (March 2020) using the newest products from Apple (watch and phone). I‚Äôve tried many times to work around the issue. I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled the app...I disconnect from WiFi before I start. Nothing seems to work. After years of praising this app I can‚Äôt anymore. It‚Äôs discouraging to have a great run just for it to be lost. I‚Äôve started just using the activity app on the watch itself and it works great! I‚Äôve deleted the Nike App and will give them some time to hopefully improve.	positive
136	387771637	health_and_fitness	4	"I am on the Cross Country and Track & Field Team for my school. I run a 5k every summer and spring. I just found out about the app and had to get it. I started out with a basic mile around my neighborhood with a friend. I used my phone. The other day I was going to go for another run with the app but five seconds into getting on the home screen, the workout automatically started. 3... 2... 1... starting workout. I found this very difficult because I wanted to run 3 miles but I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to reset it and pick a new distance. I ended up leaving my phone at home and just running the 3 mile course in my neighborhood. Please make this a bit simpler to use.

On a positive note, the first run was amazing! I was able to sync the music on my phone to the app so while I ran I could listen to music without having to have two apps open. It even let me select my own playlist! 
If you are a runner or want to be I would definitely recommend downloading this app! Maybe the next update will make it simpler to use!"	positive
137	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	"I used to be a casual Nike+ app user, before the first Apple Watch was released. For the past few months, however, I‚Äôve been marathon training, using the My Coach feature on the iPhone app and wearing my Watch on my runs to track heartbeat and more accurate calorie burn. I‚Äôm disappointed the My Coach feature isn‚Äôt available on my Watch (Series 3 GPS), nor does my running activity (history) show up in the NRC app on my Watch. I‚Äôm also disappointed that the NRC complication on my Watch is useless because the Last Run & Next Run information doesn‚Äôt sync from the iPhone app. Please add My Coach functionality to the Watch app as soon as possible.

The app crashes / doesn‚Äôt track runs 100% of the time. I‚Äôve had to restart Audio Guided Runs from My Coach multiple times because it crashes a few minutes into my run. I‚Äôm paranoid now, so I reboot both my iPhone and my Watch before each run, and go through the Watch setup in the NRC iPhone app each time as well. It‚Äôs a huge time-waster.

Thanks for your attention to these issues. I look forward to the next update when they‚Äôre all fixed!"	negative
138	387771637	health_and_fitness	1	I have AW2 NRC edition so you would think using this app would be seamless right? wrong. Laggy and buggy ... can take several seconds and attempts trying to Start a run but it‚Äôs only downhill from there. Sometimes you get no GPS and your outdoor run displays like a treadmill run. Trying to Stop a run is the worst. It will routinely Pause but actually Ending a run is nearly impossible. My last two runs the App crashed in between Pause and Ending and I was stuck in a vicious loop where NRC kept trying to Start a run even though my actual run had not officially Ended. They both eventually showed in my feed but my distance and MM pace were both hosed. I have opened several tickets with Nike and it‚Äôs always the same: do you have the latest iOS and Watch OS and NRC app? Yes to all three. Then they advise to uninstall/reinstall, which I have now done several times yet there is never improvement and appears to be getting worse. Frustrating that Apple sells the NRC edition watch and there is zero integration... it‚Äôs just a 3rd party buggy app. There does appear to be more consistency on short runs but like other reviewers said, if u hit double digits it‚Äôs a crapshoot. Sort it out already Nike, this is ridiculous.	negative
139	387771637	health_and_fitness	2	"This app is great for tracking runs, but what I don‚Äôt like is that they took away some things that were great about the app. 
1. Show friends level and/or miles. One of the most driving things is to not be outdone by your friends. People work hard to get to a certain level. What‚Äôs the point if nobody can see it but you?
Bring back challenges. I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre gone completely or just hidden, but challenges were fun! It gets people moving who may not be moving. 
I‚Äôm not with all of the social stuff with strangers. I think the app is going in a direction of social media, but taking away from the social part of friends interacting with friends. I don‚Äôt see a need to share pictures of my run with strangers who could care less, just as I could care less about theirs. 
I also miss the part where we could get cheers from Facebook. That was motivation on your run. I used it all of the time. Then it was messed up where it posted a picture on my Facebook and and didn‚Äôt shut down the post when I was done running so people could comment on it all day....instead of just fixing that, I guess they just took that feature away completely."	positive
140	387771637	health_and_fitness	1	I‚Äôm an intermediate runner that runs 2 to 3 times per week. I‚Äôve been using Nike technology since 2009 when you had to use a chip in the shoe. This app is something to be ashamed of. It‚Äôs been continually over developed for the past two years. They constantly try to improve on things that are cosmetic or aesthetically pleasing, when really, all I want is functionality. sometimes, things don‚Äôt sync with my Apple Watch when I start a run on it, other times it completely freezes. On today‚Äôs run, The watch and the phone kept pausing and resuming my run about every 10 seconds. This was obviously enormously frustrating. Last week I had to completely log out of the app and log back in and order to update any of my runs. But when I did, it lost the entire log.  I constantly have to cancel and restart training plans, because of bugs. This obviously defeats the purpose of the training plan. Until Nike starts to get a tag together, I recommend getting Strava, MapMyRun, Runkeeper, or any other app that‚Äôs dedicated to running. frankly, Nike should just be ashamed of itself. As a Tier One athletic organization, especially one with such ties to technology, you would think it would be better.	negative
141	387771637	health_and_fitness	3	Plenty of bugs in the system.  1) Locks out ‚Äúpodcasts‚Äù on the iphone 7.  2) ‚ÄúSpeed runs‚Äù under ‚ÄúMy coach‚Äù give you a 3-2-1 countoff and then nothing, so you have to hold your phone in your hand while you race down the asphalt, watching your phone to see when you complete 200 meters, and then watch the clock to see when your recovery is done.  3) No way to delete runs (I had a ‚Äòrun‚Äô engaged while riding on the bullet train so it registered me doing a 20-second kilometer).  4) Guided runs need a little more guidance in ‚Äúhow to run‚Äù (e.g. stay relaxed, alignment and form, breathing, reducing shoulder or hand tension, watch the shoulder girdle, etc.) and less chatter with guests.  5) Difficulty level choices in the NTC workout, especially yoga.  6) The layout is not especially user-friendly.   Takes a long time to figure out how to navigate through the app, which is a pain when all you want to do is hit the trail.  Too much screen real estate is given to pictures of people running and not enough instruction or links for ‚Äúnext‚Äù move.   I‚Äôm always ‚Äúgoing back‚Äù through the feed to find what I want.	positive
142	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	"I have never been a runner. I exercise a lot, but rarely by running. Usually I go to the gym and get on an elliptical and read. As a law student it is the one time a day I get to read something I enjoy.

I am writing this at the end of week 1 covid-19. My gym closed 4 days ago and I knew if I was going to not go stir crazy I would have to make myself run. So I downloaded NRC to give it a try and just track my time and miles. 

The first couple days went better than I expected. Being able to keep track of my time and pace and distance I could set goals. I didn‚Äôt love it. I missed reading. But I enjoyed it more than I expected. I Then I tried a guided run. Instant love. I went to a basic first run. I instantly felt more confident in my pace and more encouraged. I no longer felt like this was something I was doing for my sanity being stuck inside all day but rather something I could come away feeling success and that I could continue to succeed. I can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow‚Äôs run!"	positive
143	387771637	health_and_fitness	4	"A few months back I decided to start a training plan with the coach option.  It has changed my life! I remember dreading my first ‚Äúlong run‚Äù of 1.5 miles. I just now finished a recovery run of four miles without any trouble at all, and I‚Äôm training for my first half marathon!

My only complaint seems to be a common one. On interval runs I have to constantly check my phone to see if I‚Äôve reached the required distance. When I have, I have to manually hit the pause button, and then keep an eye on my phone to see when my rest period is over. I then have to hit the start button again. Lather, rinse, and repeat. This gets old when you are doing a 16x200. It‚Äôs also difficult and distracting to do when I am sprinting. 

The app already had a timer, a distance tracker, and the ability to automatically pause a workout. I don‚Äôt know why these features can‚Äôt be combined to make for a seamless interval run. It‚Äôs the only thing stopping me from giving this 5 stars. Please fix!"	negative
144	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôve been using the Nike Run Club app for years to track my runs outside and in the gym. It was great to track distance, mile splits, and see my progress overtime. However, I never really used it for anything else. Today was the first day I used a guided run. I completed the Run Strong Repeat 30 minute speed workout and my god, have I been missing out. The voice of Coach Cox is absolutely amazing. It‚Äôs obviously convenient to have a coach tell you when to run for ninety seconds and when to start the 45 second recovery as opposed to looking at a watch or phone. The most unexpected joy of this guided run was Coach Cox‚Äôs encouraging and motivating words. I haven‚Äôt had a running coach since high school and I forgot how motivating it is to have one. I found myself smiling as Cox rooted me on and pushing myself harder when she told me to use my strength. It was awesome. I look forward to the coming NRC workouts that I will now use to improve my running!	positive
145	387771637	health_and_fitness	2	"This app is a fantastic tracker on the Apple Watch when it actually works. However, I'm finding it to be unreliable the majority of the time I use it. For example, I'll start a run, go for a couple miles, take a break to walk for a few minutes only to look down at my Apple Watch that I've only been going for two minutes. It doesn't make sense especially when I have auto-pause turned off and I have excellent cell phone signal. Additionally, the app lags a lot. Let's say I'm ready to cool down... I look at my watch to pause the app, but the app isn't quick enough to recognize that I need to manually pause it. Swiping to the left to do so seems like an interface flaw. 

Additionally, the voiceover companion is super loud and obnoxious. You can turn it off, but for some reason, the app doesn't save your settings over time. It's always frightening getting done a workout and having your watch scream at you. I appreciate the motivation, but this feature seems unnecessary. I can't imagine many people utilize it. Just give me my stats, I don't need a prolonged ""congratulations"" for something I do everyday."	positive
146	387771637	health_and_fitness	1	I want to love this app - after all it is the focal point of the Nike edition Apple Watch and I have been using Nike to track runs for over 10 years. Unfortunately though, the Watch version of this app is terrible. It takes 2-4 minutes for the app to load on my watch each time I open it (I get that annoying blinking yellow dot while it loads). The app frequently crashes for me on runs longer than 5 miles - sometimes at random and more frequently when I go to end a run. I have contacted Nike support multiple times and nobody has been able to resolve my issues. So incredibly frustrating and baffling that Apple would choose to partner with/feature such a glitchy app on an otherwise great smart watch. The phone version of the app is also lacking - I am unable to tell some basic things about my runs, like what time they started and ended at. Instead the app is too focused on the ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù aspect of running. It would also be great if they could use AI or some other technique to adjust for clear GPS issues - often my runs show me veering suddenly into the Hudson River or other abnormalities due to spotty GPS. Nike needs to focus on getting the basics fixed.	positive
147	387771637	health_and_fitness	2	I‚Äôve been using the Nike running app for almost 10 years. I always loved it. From the running plans (which they updated and the new plans are never the right fit) to the competitive aspect where you can see a leaderboard of all your friends. I love new cheering feature where your friends can cheer you on during your run and vice versa. But I‚Äôve been using the app since watch series 1 (I‚Äôm now on the series 3) and it‚Äôs never been a good experience. It freezes, crashes, I end my runs to soon from tapping when I thought it was frozen. Worst of all I just discovered even when I thought it was working, it wasn‚Äôt syncing my runs. I had 17 runs in October, Nike app says 14. I had 8 runs in November so far and Nike says 2. But I know because the activity app says I ran with Nike run. The other day after a run with my brother I told him about my issues and he said ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just use a different app?I've been using Nike run so long that the thought never occurred to me. Well today is the today. If they fix the issues I‚Äôll come back. But it‚Äôs too frustrating. Nike Run is now a flagship app on the watches so i expect better.	positive
148	387771637	health_and_fitness	5	"I began using this app in bursts over 5 years ago. Honestly, I‚Äôm way too heavily invested to change now. Still, overall I‚Äôve enjoyed the app. The ability to share with friends how many miles you‚Äôve logged can help keep you motivated when friends are in different cities/states/countries. I appreciated the previous online interface (long gone now) but with the integration to Apple Health I find the information still pretty accessible. I don‚Äôt have a watch that can sync with it so I can‚Äôt speak to that but running with my phone and AirPods has been fantastic. 

The only frustration I would share is during the coached runs the volume swings between the music and the commentary can be significant. I have attempted to use Siri through my AirPods to adjust the volume midrun and then the coaching stops. The run keeps logging but no more coaching which can be lame on hour-plus runs. I worked with Nike support and the problem never was resolved."	positive
149	387771637	health_and_fitness	1	This app is garbage. I run/walk in intervals to build up to run a full 5K and beat my times. I have walked/ran the exact same route and it has recorded me at different distances repeatedly. I took a picture. Not to mention the fact that I ran in 80%+ humidity to beat my mile time and the recording distance was all over the place. It recorded me only covering .03 miles for a distance and then once the mile time was up it suddenly added .12 miles to less distance while I was frigging walking. A lot of good that did me. It‚Äôs amazing how if I actually run, it can‚Äôt record for crap but if I walk it wants to claim I‚Äôm covering extra ground. Exact same distance with landmarks every single day, and different recordings every single day. Today it wanted to tell me that I only went 3.11 miles when all the times before I walked the exact same route and it said I went farther. Which is it? Because when I am timing myself I care about accuracy. The developers need to run outside in summer weather with humidity to see what it feels like to have a goal and have no idea if you are meeting it or not. Focus on my breathing in humidity or figure out what the crap the app is doing...those are my options.	positive

Problem number one.i just got the app and I played the first level and then I finished it with no problem no ads or anything and far on from that it was add town add music add games just sooo many ads! I tried to click the x on the screen to exit the add and when I hit it it replayed the add again and then added another add!!! ITS SO FRUSTRATING!!!!!  Problem two. Whenever I‚Äôm so close to winning but have less man it automatically puts more things to kill my men and then if I don‚Äôt win it plays five adds in a row for 3 levels I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a glitch or not but I hate it. Those or just two reasons why I hate this app and would be GLAD to delete it and I think if your just thinking about downloading this app you may want to reconsider that it is a big big big horrible BAD mistake to download but if there is any updates that help the game we‚Äôll see how that goes on. But for now NEVER EVEN LOOK AT THiS IT WILL MAKE YOU WANT TO HIT YOUR ELECTRONIC OVER AND OVER TILL THERES NO MORE PEICES OF THE CUMPUTER OR PHONE OR TABLET

So don‚Äôt even think about this app"	negative
151	1499812410	games	1	"Hello I got this game yesterday and I already see problems and with all this quarantine stuff in IL I can‚Äôt do anything else but play games. Problem #1 SO MANY ADS. I understand that you have to include ads but one after every time u beat the level? That is simply unacceptable. Problem #2 the levels are unfair. The bosses are way over my level and they get weapons all I get is two hands for punching. I level up the sword symbol thing and it doesn‚Äôt help defeat them. I personally do not recommend this at all this game is so boring and makes me angry. Thank you for your time. I will now delete the game. Have a nice day!

**forgot to add this: 4.6 is your rating? Do I look stupid? Read the dang reviews and tell me if that‚Äôs a 4.6 rating. Most of the reviews are 1 star. If you don‚Äôt fix all of these problems you lost yourself a player fix them and I will consider re- downloading in"	negative
152	1499812410	games	1	So, this whole quarantine thing leaves me no choice but to play games... but I‚Äôm not recommending this game! So there is SO many adds, but that‚Äôs only one out of several problems! Next the people that you have to defeat at the end of each level have weapons, I don‚Äôt! And this is obviously rigged, the person is always going to kill the same amount of people no matter if you hit the upgrade weapon button! NEXT, the obstacles take out your people, there is NO way to avoid them, that‚Äôs very annoying to me! So yes, I have no good things to say really, except that it is free, that‚Äôs literally it! THIS GAME IS BORING ANYWAYS, EVEN WITHOUT THE ISSUES! So I recommend not getting this! It is not a good way to spend your quarantine, or any time for that matter. DON‚ÄôT EVEN CONSIDER GETTING IT, A WASTE OF TIME! Have a good day, I hope that this review helped you to not waste you time on plain and udder STUPIDITY!	negative
153	1499812410	games	1	"1. Because of the ad overload, programmed to play after (just about) every level, the game often freezes. If I‚Äôm connected to WiFi it‚Äôs alright, but even then sometimes it wants me to watch one ad to open the surprise box but will make me watch two-three. 

2. I don‚Äôt really understand the point of collecting 10+ men but then putting a giant box right in the middle killing over half of my army. If you‚Äôre going to do that... shouldn‚Äôt you put it in the program where my people could jump or something? Quite a few levels, I‚Äôve had to end the round with 5 people, ultimately loosing, because of some poorly misplaced obstacles and the inability to avoid them. 

3. I don‚Äôt necessarily mind the ads. It‚Äôs a great game... the developers have to make a profit some how... y‚Äôall should program it to occur different. Have a banner on the bottom of the screens. Play a Ciro after you LOSE. 

4. The mystery box should be avoidable. I don‚Äôt care about the extra coins. Please make them as an option. (Play an ad to receive the mystery box) 

5. Please make this game more functional when not connected to WiFi. I feel like the game is programmed to run by its ads, and when they can‚Äôt play, the game malfunctions. 

Please fix in the next update."	positive
154	1499812410	games	3	This game is a type of game called ad-to-win. Watch ads, win more. The game itself has some moments when it gets jittery and your inputs don‚Äôt match to what actually happens on the screen. As for how much fun this app is? Mediocre, not happy or mad to play it. It does have some pros though. I do like the upgrades along with the character customization makes it feel more like a game than a money grab. As for me, I found that you only need a little skill to actually accomplish the missions. Would I recommend this app? Nope not really. There are much better apps out there that provide more entertainment. Lastly, the company who made this game, make your sound bites better. They are bad.	positive
155	1499812410	games	1	You can literally ‚Äúbeat‚Äù this entire game by unlocking all the skins within 2-3hrs if you choose to buy ad free for $2.99. The sad thing about this game is that you can‚Äôt see how many more levels you have to go it just never ends. And once you u lock all the skins it just keep reverting you to unlock the same skins over and over again. This game is not really designed for you to play it so that you can unlock so many items or something along that line, but it‚Äôs designed for you to buy the ‚Äúad free‚Äù features that‚Äôs all. Nobody wants to sit around and watch a total of a 1 minute ad every time you when or loose it gets frustrating so you end up buying the ad free ‚Äúversion‚Äù I honestly don‚Äôt recommend downloading this game at all unless you enjoy watching ads.	positive
156	1499812410	games	3	"This is a really fun game but each level is about 30 seconds long. After each level is a 30 second ad. Also after completing several levels you‚Äôre offered a gift if you watch a 30 second ad. The add is optional but the button that lets you decline the gift to skip the ad is the same color as the background and is difficult to see. All the other ads are optional. 

As far as the game is a really cool concept. It‚Äôs easy to pick up and fun to play. I just felt like it was really hard to get into it with so many ads. To me ads should be spaced enough so that 50% of the gameplay isn‚Äôt advertisements."	positive
157	1499812410	games	1	I got this game recently and besides the simple concept I quickly realized two things. One, the level system and boss fights are completely unfair, the bosses being way over leveled than me even though I leveled up way too many times to count. And just to lose to one boss, get it to half health and then verse it again, it‚Äôs just sad. Sometimes it‚Äôs three times. Point Two, the ads, good god the ads in this game. It‚Äôs just nonstop. After every action there‚Äôs an ad no matter what and sometimes you can‚Äôt even skip them. I turned off WiFi and cellular for it so I couldn‚Äôt get any more ads, it‚Äôs sort of better but still a pain to deal with considering ads are thrown to be the only thing that helps you in the game.	negative
158	1499812410	games	1	Every single time I finished 1 or 2 levels straight to Ad I love the game alternatively but the ads are more than enough so that made me want to delete the game over all it isnt that bad but little gameplay lotta ads isnt very fun especially when you feel like you cant see one more ad without screaming!!This game is not that bad without the ads it would have been fun like u join a group and the defeat the other team standard fun stuff but after like every other level a ad thats just annoying as crap!Im sorry if this is offensive but you gotta fix all these stupid ads!Most of the ads is the same ad please fix this and maybe Ill recommend downloading it again but if not you just lost a player.	positive
159	1499812410	games	4	So as you see the title idk what anybody is talk about! Why I gave you 4 stars is because you could use some fixing up!! Not trying to be rude cuz I play the game everyday :D! You could touch up on less adds it actually kinda annoying!  And add more obstacle course! It‚Äôs also kinda laggy which is a bit annoying! Add more levels and at least make them harder!! Over all I like the game! But could you add more hats or like add gems and we have to collect them? Or add figures that you can collect? That‚Äôs all love you game though bye!!	positive
160	1499812410	games	1	Don‚Äôt download it‚Äôs a waste of time! It is a fun game and i would play it again if it wasn‚Äôt like this. There‚Äôs an ad for double the play time, every level and the level is 30 seconds max. If you hit no thanks to watch another video half the time it will click it anyways. I hit the no add button once to see if i could buy it with coins and on my screen there was an option to buy the game. I exited it 3 times and it would not stop popping up! Then I tried to close the app and it confirmed the purchase (I have both of my thumps saved smh). I have to have a password set to get an app so thankfully I wasn‚Äôt charged, but it was glitching and clicking things I wasn‚Äôt. Pretty annoyed üôÑ	positive
161	1499812410	games	4	It‚Äôs a pretty fun game but it would be better if there were less ads and sometimes the boss fights are a little unfair because I collected as many people I can possibly get without hitting the traps but I still lose. Luckily the boss stays at the same level of health when you fight them again. It would be a massive improvement if the developers can make it online where we can fight other online players at the end. It was be nice to have more outfits instead of just a stick figure and if they can add weapons that would be awesome.	positive
162	1499812410	games	1	I think that the game could be more fun if they just stopped with the constant advertisements. It‚Äôs all the same, too, and it‚Äôs getting really boring to have to watch! Also, it‚Äôs ridiculous that if I get a present thing I have to watch an ad to claim it!! If I found it while playing the game, it makes no sense that I‚Äôd have to watch an ad to claim it! The game isn‚Äôt that long either, most rounds only last a few seconds and after that you get two ads stuffed down your throat. Maybe if the game rounds were longer it wouldn‚Äôt seem like I was being constantly bombarded with commercials! I love the idea but I think some things need to be changed!!!	positive
163	1499812410	games	4	I don‚Äôt normally write reviews but I almost didn‚Äôt download this game because of the reviews I read. I will say, the amount of ads can be annoying but I haven‚Äôt had the issue of an ad on loop. Also, I disagree that the bosses are too hard. I‚Äôm only on level 24 so I‚Äôm sure it will get harder, but I am enjoying the game. It seems easy enough to upgrade your weapon and shield to be able to defeat them. Anyways, I‚Äôm my opinion it‚Äôs worth the download.	neutral
164	1499812410	games	4	I know people are complaining about all the adds. That is fair. But you can skip all the adds (at least the ones that come up naturally without clicking a button for something extra in exchange for an add) after around 5 seconds. My only complaint is that I hear about different modes? Other than then just run and evade obstacles? If there are other modes I am not able to access them. Overall; good game!	negative
165	1499812410	games	4	This game is really good. I like the idea of it, but something just won‚Äôt connect. One reason this wasn‚Äôt rated 5 stars is because here‚Äôs how it goes: ad, ad, ad, ad, one level complete, ad, ad, ad, upgrade CP, ad, ad. Never ending ads. I‚Äôd practically buy ad free on this before I want 1million dollars. If this was the only game in the App Store, I would buy add free before I accept the offer of free mansion and free Lamborghini. Seriously, the ad problem is ridiculous.	positive
166	1499812410	games	2	"This game is kinda annoying 
#1: when I pass or do not pas a level it always puts on ads EVERY TIME and I hate it that is so annoying!
#2 the other bad part is that some of the obstacles are too hard for any of the kids to pass and then I just lose so that is annoying
#3 the third reason why is that wile it is doing ads when I press the X button it puts me in the App Store and thinks I want to download it but I do not.    And the good part it the game works with no WI-FI so that is good, well I hope this game gets an upgrade sometime soonüòÅ"	negative
167	1499812410	games	1	"The layout for this game is the same as all the others: you complete levels, get coins, use coins on ads. Same 5 levels over and over. 
They have a stat system to upgrade your attack, defense, and money. As far as I can tell, this is completely broken. As the levels progress, it does seem that the end boss gets stronger, but none of your upgrades seem to help. If they do help, the difference is minuscule. It‚Äôs just a ploy to get you to watch another video. 

The frustrating thing is, as with all these games, there‚Äôs so much wasted potential."	negative
168	1499812410	games	1	Had to watch an ad after the second level. An ad is one thing but there was no option to skip the ad. I didn‚Äôt choose to watch an ad for benefits like 3x coins or opening extra chests. It was a routine ad that I had to watch the entirety of for no reason. I deleted the app before the ad finished. Stop riddling these little games with ads like this. I only get them to waste time every now and then, not to watch ad after ad with 10 seconds of play time in between. The game not even that good for you to be tryna make people pay for no ads. üòï	negative
169	1499812410	games	1	"A free game has to make money somehow so they use ads. Thing is every level you complete, every reward you earn you have to watch ads. There‚Äôs this ‚Äòno thanks‚Äô option but it doesn‚Äôt seem to work. Every time I try to select the no thanks option it still plays an ad. The game itself is mediocre at best which isn‚Äôt too surprising.

This is another one of those fake games that focuses more on ads than the game itself and may try to luck out by making your spend money. Don‚Äôt waste your time or money on this."	positive
170	1499812410	games	1	Okay first imma just say the ads are everywhere when you beat a level, Ads, when you die in a level, Ads, i don‚Äôt think this game is fun either i have other games that have this and well, this may be one of the worst apps I downloaded. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs just too boring and many many MANY ADS!!! So please if you could just not make the other people have to watch so many ads EVERY LEVEL!? WHETHER THEY BEAT THE LEVEL OR GET DEFEATED!? I‚Äôm going to delete this app and well I don‚Äôt know if I will download it again probably not, just please no more ads.	negative
171	1499812410	games	4	"this is a super fun game to play when you‚Äôre bored. every time that i need something to do, i pull up this game and have a great time! there is a problem with the ads though. i think that having an ad after every level is a little too much. maybe every other level would be a little better...? there is  a lot of good things about this game too. first of all, it was free! something else i like about it is when you complete a level, your characters start to do a hilarious dance! it is really entertaining! üòÇ
overall, i think this is a really good game except for all the ads. most reviews rate this as the worst game ever, but i think it just depends on the person!"	positive
172	1499812410	games	1	I don‚Äôt like bashing a game usually for ads because it is free and usually I can just put up with it, however this really seems worse than most app games of this type. The ads are CONSTANT and many times you can‚Äôt skip them so you have to wait almost a minute after each level. I‚Äôm 99% sure you spend more time watching ads then actually playing the game and that‚Äôs just not worth it for me. I‚Äôm all for supporting free content and I usually don‚Äôt mind sitting through a few ads but this is just ridiculous	positive
173	1499812410	games	1	This game is seriously bad. I downloaded it because I thought it was fun, it actually looked like a decent game. When I downloaded it and played the first level, I was disgusted. This game looks like it was made by a child. It isn‚Äôt well made and when I tried upgrading it did absolutely nothing. There is also way to many ads. I understand that some is needed, but every three seconds I see an ad or get asked to watch an add. If you are thinking about downloading this, don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs a waste of time and will disappoint you.	negative
174	1499812410	games	1	This game I say is a fun game and all. But I have a lot of problems with this app. One, WAY TO MANY ADS!!! And every time I click the close button, the get this app thing shows up! I press done then clicked the close button, BUT THEN IT JUST KEPT ON SHOWING UP OVER AND OVER AGAIN!ü•µ. Two, It‚Äôs just SOOOOO ANNOYING WHENEVER STUPID GUYS AND TOO MANY OBSTACLES JUST POP OUT OF NO WHERE!!! THEN IT KILLS ALL OF MY GUYS EXCEPT THREE OF THEM!! THEN I HAVE TO FIGHT FREAKING FIFTY STUPID GUYS WITH THREE OF MY GUYS! In my opinion this app is the stupidest game ever. I HATE IT!!! Now that u just herd that review, maybe think twice about getting this app!üòè	negative
175	1499812410	games	4	I dont understand why everybody thinks this game has so many problems. 1.) they think that the bosses are too over powered, when I beat them every single time. They obviously don‚Äôt have enough people on their team. 2.) the ads...? RELAX PEOPLE! You get two games then one add. CHILLAX! In order to win the game, you should have a nice amount of people on your team. I personally LOVE this game.	positive
176	1499812410	games	5	I am in the middle of my first game .  The only thing that would make me delete is only if the ads are too invasive.  So far, this fun game is lively, relaxing and easy. The game I have kept the longest is Hearts üíï because no ad is longer than 5 seconds or so, which is plenty of time to choose if you want to download.	positive
177	1499812410	games	5	Ok number one:its very fun and entertaining because of all this quarantine stuff i am  very limited of things to do number 2:BARELY ANY ADS i was reading one review and it said every level there was a ad in my case i have only  gotten one and I've had it for 10 min i really recommend this game!	positive
178	1499812410	games	2	This could actually be a cool game if it didn‚Äôt have so many ads everywhere. Sometimes, it made you watch the whole 30sec long ad with no way to exit. Everytime you go through a level which feels like it takes 15 seconds there‚Äôs another even longer ad. You can never press the ‚Äòno thanks‚Äô button. Ad down the bottom even when you play. Just RIDDLED with them. Such a shame.	positive
179	1499812410	games	5	I love this game! I don‚Äôt really think there is that many adds! I like how this game is very unique and fun! It‚Äôs really addicting, I‚Äôve been playing all night! I gave this game five stars because I see nothing wrong with it! It‚Äôs super fun, I definitely recommend this app!:)	positive
180	1499812410	games	4	I think that this game is pretty fun and that some people are just over exaggerating. On the boss levels you just have to get enough people to beat them. The one thing I would change about this is the ads that pop up every four levels or so. But over all this game is amazing!	positive
181	1499812410	games	1	Apple should be ashamed for letting this game come out on its platform. We buy apple to protect us from this garbage. Garbage should be the title. It‚Äôs ads on top of ads on top of more ads with a little bit of game play and more ads. It completely horrible garbage game. Stop right now don‚Äôt it don‚Äôt put this on your phone so it will go away to where it belongs, in the garbage. The 4.5 rating has to be fake. Games like this don‚Äôt get ratings like that. It don‚Äôt deserve the one star. Garbage game. Stop making games your bad at it.	negative
182	1499812410	games	2	Each level is virtually the same, there is little uniqueness to each run which makes the game fun for the first day or two then very quickly boring.  After each run, you have to watch an ad to upgrade to wast 30 seconds... also, you have to rerun each level 2-3 times as the end guy is too difficult even if you get all of the extra guys	negative
183	1499812410	games	5	I love this game but when I first downloaded this when I finished the first level  it said I review and I was l was likeü§®‚ÄùI just downloaded this and it already asking for a review like bruh‚Äùanyway this is just day 1 so I‚Äôm gonna see when it asked me again bye random person :3 :)	positive
184	1499812410	games	2	I recently downloaded this game and it‚Äôs cool and all, it just has so many ads, even when you say no thanks to getting more coins you still have to sit through some type of ad.. takes the fun out the game because of the annoying ads that they force you to watch... yes ads are how you make your money but if you say no thanks to the ad then you shouldn‚Äôt be forced to watch one.	negative
185	1499812410	games	2	You‚Äôre forced to watch the ads at the end of each level because the no thanks button doesn‚Äôt work. It slows down gameplay significantly if the no thanks button were to work I would probably upgrade to a 4 star rating. But as of now, no matter how fun the game is I don‚Äôt want to play it if I‚Äôm forced to watch an ad at the end of each level.	positive
186	1499812410	games	2	Hello to everybody who‚Äôs playing or reading this so the first thing I don‚Äôt like about this game is the adds they pop up to much it‚Äôs very annoying and two the people they have no face they are just blue things that weird and the last thing is the blood part the blood part is scary to some kids and could have there health go down but yea i don‚Äôt really care if you think I‚Äôm wrong but yea	negative
187	1499812410	games	1	Most recent update made the game too easy.  With the new hero character it‚Äôs impossible to lose.  The only challenge is to lose on purpose by running into a wall. Was good with a decent challenge.  But now it‚Äôs no point to play. Ruined the game. It‚Äôs just an ad revenue game now.  The only point is to watch ads.   You can lose.  You don‚Äôt have to recruit anyone and won‚Äôt lose.  The only point of this game is to watch ads for the developers.	negative
188	1499812410	games	1	Take it from me, I got bored with this game after about 25 minutes. While the character animations and items are kind of cute, the levels repeat. The max level I got to was maybe 20. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the ads. I got shown ads every minute about. I had to turn off my data so that I could play the game with any kind of continuity. Just overall not fun. Pointless bonus levels. I don‚Äôt they even give me any extra coins.	negative
189	1499812410	games	4	So, I read the reviews and found that they are bad. Everyone complains about the ads. I figured, you can turn on airplane mode. In the boss battles, you just need to get at least 90% of people and you win. It‚Äôs a really good game! I hope there will be more challenges!	positive
190	1499812410	games	1	The ads are just overwhelming.  There is a permanent banner ad at the bottom, and forced ads after after super short level. The ads give you more coins, but even when you chose to skip those ads, you are forced to watch shorter ads.  It is unreal.  The game seems fun, but I can‚Äôt take how often the ads are forced on you.  I would have liked to play more, but just can‚Äôt - not with how many ads there are.	positive
191	1499812410	games	3	"just grouping up and trying to get through obstacles together but you control group movements

it got ads and i control my group and try to avoid being hit but i wasn‚Äôt in the space to get hit and my team still got hit

I would suggest like adding ore apace or adding more team mates in that one obstacle course area if possible."	negative
192	1499812410	games	1	30  second ad after each level. Then provided an option for an additional ad for more points or TRY AGAIN option in the smallest barely visible watermark font. Worse is when you press the TRY AGAIN the game decides to play an ad anyways. Definitely focused on annoying you with ads to the point you pay for no ads or delete it. 4.6 rating seems fake like most reviews on App Store.	negative
193	1499812410	games	1	I recently got this game and after 7 level deleted it. During thoughts seven levels I had already seen about 20 ads. There are way to many adsüò°! Overall if there were no ads I would probably give this game 3 stars because it‚Äôs free and fun, but the content is so original. If they could delete the ads and make the content more difficult then I might consider downloading this game again.	positive
194	1499812410	games	1	This app seems to be solely designed to collect information from your phone about you. Such as your advertising ID (who knew I even had one?), browser history, etc. I am sure there are numerous other click bate apps such as this! The number of stars it has received could also be generated to lure people into thinking it is a game, albeit disguised to collect and sell your info!	positive
195	1499812410	games	5	I‚Äôm asking the game if they can make so there‚Äôs two people on each side not robots and they race to see how many you can get then fight in the middle it would make the game a lot better	positive
196	1499812410	games	2	There‚Äôs an option to watch ads to get free upgrades but when you click on them nothing happens... the only ads that work are the ones that you‚Äôre forced to watch between levels. If you don‚Äôt want these ads showing up, put your phone in airplane mode and restart the app. You won‚Äôt see them anymore	negative
197	1499812410	games	2	"I recently just got this game and was excited cuz I wanted a game like this. But after the first level there was 2 ads I could not believe it. This continued on after every single level and I was so annoyed I would like the ads to stop NOW. Another problem was that the bosses had weapons like swords to fight, and our little guy had only ball hands.

This game is UNACCEPTABLE!!!!!!!!üò°"	negative
198	1499812410	games	5	This game is fun but I do not like the way the  people  turn it makes it so hard to turn left or right and I do not like it but keep making good games	negative
199	1499812410	games	1	Must have hundreds of fake accounts giving this game 5 star reviews because it‚Äôs terrible. I am not exaggerating when I say you will spend more time watching ads than playing the game. In game they give you the option to watch ads to double your coins, etc. but even when you choose the skip option YOU STILL WATCH AN AD. It‚Äôs just slightly shorter. Really makes the game unplayable	negative
200	1099771240	health_and_fitness	4	I came across this app accidentally. I was looking for A ‚ÄúHow To Do Squats With A Medicine Ball Routine‚Äù on You Tube.  I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with what I found and this app popped up. At this moment I am on the 7 day Trial try and so far I like what I have already accomplished.  These workouts look soooo easy to do. Ummm yes.... for someone who has worked out for a substantial amount of time!!  However, I am a beginner and I am waking up muscle I never knew I had. Mind you I am ‚ÄúONLY‚Äù 2 days in. If you do the positions properly you will feel all the burns etc. I go to the gym Tuesdays, Wednesday‚Äôs and Thursday‚Äôs because I do not have the machine I need for my torn ACL and Meniscus therefore I go. The app helps me do what I am not doing at the gym at home with the workout means I do have like the weights to incorporate them into the workouts slowly.  It is worth the 4.99 a week for 30 days.  No difference between a monthly charge you pay at a gym besides it being a little less. I was hesitant but at the same time the doubt comes from me doubting myself about being able to do this. Believe me it looks easy but you don‚Äôt know unless you TRY it!!  You have to start somewhere so I chose to download the app and do the workouts behind closed doors where I am not feeling as if I am being watched while doing my workout!! Kudos to the trainers who created this app.	positive
201	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	"I am beyond upset with the financial and customer service with this application. I‚Äôve consistently been overcharged. It is absolutely ridiculous that your ap promotes paying 4.99 a week, but I was charged 20 dollars on the same day on the 28th. Now, three days later on the 31st, which is less than a week I‚Äôm being charged another 4.99. This amounts to 25 dollars in one week, which is absolutely unacceptable. When I tried to voice my concerns and request a refund, I received an automatic email and then a failure to respond once I replied to the automatic email. 

There is also a malfunction with your software that forces me to subscribe more than once which results in you overcharging my account for multiple subscriptions. Even after I canceled the extra subscription and received a refund from Apple, the same issue occurred in a matter of a week. As someone who was truly enjoying this application and recommended it to many of my friends and family, I am deeply disappointed in the lack of customer service and regard for people‚Äôs finances. I will ensure to leave a review of my awful experience on any fitness website and on Apple as possible. I will also be receiving a refund from my credit card institution. I hope you all can improve one day. Sincerely, not happy.

PS: Now that I‚Äôm trying to leave this review it isn‚Äôt letting me because I rated it so low. You all are scam artists."	negative
202	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	I like the built-in timers ... and the intuitive use of the user interface, it‚Äôs so easy to drag up between sets.  The exercises themselves are ok, having done p90x and insanity when I was younger (I‚Äôm 56) I found their exercises well-designed, now I‚Äôm not up to that level and this app is seriously helping me get back to that ‚Äî maybe it‚Äôs not a fair comparison, but it‚Äôs what I have.  It‚Äôs not that the exercises are much different, but I find that they pay less attention to ergonomics and physiology than those systems ‚Äî especially for those of us who need some steps to get to those movements.   On the other hand, what this has that the others don‚Äôt, is the ability to adjust the load after each workout, very cool.  The other thing I wish is that they paid more attention to earn-up and cool-down and actually spent a little time on stretches before and after.  It‚Äôs not a bit deal because I‚Äôve added those on my own ... but as much as I like this app there‚Äôs small tweaks that would make it amazing for me.  I still give it a five star for finding an awesome app design that really helps me stick with it.	positive
203	1099771240	health_and_fitness	2	"First and foremost, I am a health educator and epidemiologist. I set my goal weight in this app and it claimed I would reach that goal through the customized 30 day plan. I figured it was asking my goal weight to set up a plan based on making proper progress towards that... but no, it actually claims it‚Äôs going to get you to your goal weight in 30 days. Unless your goal is 10 pounds or less, or you‚Äôre extremely morbidly obese and susceptible to lots of weight loss in a short time with discipline, there is literally no way that‚Äôs happening. Again, I am a health educator. For context, I would like to lose 25 pounds. The app says it would get me there within 30 days if I ate 1200 calories a day (HA). 

Also, you cannot use this app unless you pay for it. You just can‚Äôt. You make your account, do a couple beginning questions, and it takes you to the screen to sign up for a free trial which then will charge you 4.99/week (ridiculous), that‚Äôs how much I pay to be a member at my local gym.. let alone use an app with unrealistic, unscientific workout plans. Anyway, if you do not want to end up getting charged 5 bucks a week, you cannot use the app. You get stuck on the free trial agreement, and that‚Äôs it. I deleted the app a good 10 mins after downloading."	positive
204	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	"This app lifts your hopes so high when your hopes fall they break every single bone in their body. The app has a nice look and design and lets you customize your training level etc THEN when you're done putting in your name you have to pay or get a free trial! There is NO mention of having to pay in the description except for the fact it says In-app purchases which usually means you have an option to pay for something in the app. BUT NO you guys have to make the app free and make people download your app and then hit me with a MONTHLY payment to use the app. This is JUST a mobile app not a ""personal trainer"" as the makers of this app imply in response to another bad review. A personal trainer is a REAL PERSON who gives you advice, helps you with exercise, and has scheduled classes for you that they encourage you to physically come to. This is a simple planner with notifications and a little bit more than that, which has an unnecessary monthly fee. AT LEAST have a free version that only has a few features and then have an optional monthly payment for the whole shebang. I am extremely disappointed and the only reason this has two stars is because it looks nice actually SCRATCH THAT IM GIVING YOU ONE STAR. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE APP DO NOT RECOMMEND. I INSTANTLY uninstalled it. Fix this and don't respond to be with that copy and paste response."	negative
205	1099771240	health_and_fitness	2	So I downloaded the app after my doctor told me I needed to lose some weight. I saw this was a highly rated free app, i tried some workouts and the next day I get a pop up about the working out like a pro. Which I didn‚Äôt want because it wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for. I did not want extreme workouts. The Pro option is, well, an option! The app forces you to pay for it in order to use it basically! I was frustrated so I started the trial and when my trial was up it charged me for it, I didn‚Äôt receive any emails about it being over soon because it went to my spam folder. So now I lost my $5 and now that I cancelled the subscription, the Pro Trainer mode thing keeps popping up again and I can‚Äôt use it! If you try and buy it and hit cancel it moves you to a screen that says ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù But there isn‚Äôt even an option to click ‚ÄúYes I Am Sure I Don‚Äôt Want To Pay!!‚Äù It is an in app purchase, it is optional and you need to give people the option to say ‚ÄúNo Thanks‚Äù or ‚ÄúSkip‚Äù because I just was looking for the free and easy workouts, I‚Äôm not trying to become a super strong person, I am just trying to stay in shape! Please fix this problem and ad an ‚ÄúX‚Äù button to skip it! And if possible I want my money back because I am very disappointed!	positive
206	1099771240	health_and_fitness	3	"I used the first week for free and had no problems canceling the trial before being charged. For people who give l this app a low rating because you cannot cancel the subscription - you do it in App store app, where you cancel all other subscriptions, google for more info. 

The reason why I‚Äôm giving this app 3 stars is the following. The app promotes and gives an impression that you get customized trainings based on different names of workouts - Core, or Full Body, etc. I ended up purchasing the app because i loved that idea and also that it provided various challenges. However, after some time of using it, i noticed that the set of exercises does not really differ depending on the training i choose. For example, i‚Äôm recommended to do Core, Full Body and i also do a couple of challenges - for upper body and the other one for legs. So today i decided to check what exercises were planned for me for Core training, Upper body challenge and legs challenge. And i noticed that the exercises were all the same. So to train legs i needed to do crunches. Not sure if it‚Äôs a glitch or it‚Äôs meant to be that way, but i‚Äôll be looking for a different app where exercise sets do vary."	positive
207	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	I love, LOVE this app.  20 min per day, $5/week, in your own home at your pace when YOU want to work out. You can use the app while listening to your favorite playlist. All you need is a yoga mat! I‚Äôm in my fifties and devote a lot of my time to my family and work. I didn‚Äôt need a gym membership, I needed motivation. Seriously, give it a month. I lost 15 lb. in a month!  I do routines 5-6 days a week, and try to do 2 a day a few times/week...The transformation in my body is AMAZING. Rolls are melting off, replaced by muscle and sexy curves. There are so many exercises you can do! I love that there are real people doing the videos. No one talks to you, which is great, also!! You CAN read a detailed description of each exercise which is wonderful. I cannot say enough. You will become hooked. I loved the fact you can do in your home, and of course with the quarantine, you cannot pick a better fitness app. The tech support is super, too. What are you waiting for? Look great, feel great, be healthy and happy for $5/week. Thanks 30 day fitness! I truly run your fan club.	positive
208	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	I am a blind user who accesses my IPhone using Apple's screenreader, VoiceOver. I have been combing the App Store for a fitness app that I can stick with, and this seems to be the right one for me. The exercises have clear written instructions that are good enough for me to follow, without relying on video that I cannot see. The voice guidance is also very necessary since I can't rely on any visual cues, and honestly, who looks at their phone when exercising? Someone who's more focused on reading texts than burning fat, if you as me! The only minor glitch I have is when I swipe up using VoiceOver, sometimes I get stuck with an exercise for many many sets. Or at least, that's what I think happened with my five sets of side leg raises from Hell! Haha, thanks to this app, this couch potato really has no excuse not to incorporate some movement into her life, except maybe the fact that she really doesn't enjoy exercise, but I don't think any app has the magical ability to fix that. Thank you for keeping this app simple, effective, and accessible.	positive
209	1099771240	health_and_fitness	4	"I was doing the free week trial and I was doing a bunch of ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù. However I noticed that in  few of he challenges I was working on, the exercises were repeated. For example, I was doing the flat tummy and I got ‚Äúside leg raises‚Äù, I enjoy that workout. But when I went to do the arms challenge, I got this workout again. So my question is do you have a base of workouts and just random select them for a challenge or am I not knowledgeable of how side leg raises are supposed to help my arms get toned?
Besides that, I think the app is super user friendly and very straightforward. I would like to be able to go back on a few calendar days of the challenges because I accidentally finished one without meaning to and couldn‚Äôt go back and finish it. I know there was an option to finish it, pause it, and get back to it later but I wasn‚Äôt thinking and finished it so my workout for the day was cut short. 
Please please let me know because I would like to pay to use this app because it‚Äôs super cheap and awesome but not if the workouts are just the same for all the challenges. 

Thank you."	positive
210	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	"Your Ads are misinforming many people who are uninformed when it comes to their health and what ‚Äúideal‚Äù truly is. Telling people in your ads that 2-5% body fat is ‚Äúessential‚Äù is extremely wrong. It is extremely unhealthy to live at this % of body fat. It is not in anyway ‚Äúessential‚Äù or the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù amount. The only people that should be doing this, if at all, are professional competitive bodybuilders. However, they reach this ONLY for competition and don‚Äôt live with it for longer than a week. Many of them have reported a decrease in quality of health during this 1 week period (obviously). They end up going back up to about 10-12% body fat or even higher after competition. 

 Also, advertising that muscle isn‚Äôt ‚Äúweight‚Äù is also very wrong. I‚Äôm not sure if the creators of this app are english speakers, but in the ad it says, ‚ÄúPut on muscle, not weight‚Äù. People need to understand that when you‚Äôre building muscle you‚Äôre going to gain weight. Misleading people into thinking you‚Äôre going to lose weight while gaining muscle is not the best thing because they‚Äôll possibly lose motivation in their goal if they see that they‚Äôre gaining weight. It is totally healthy to put on extra weight, whether it‚Äôs muscle or fat."	neutral
211	1099771240	health_and_fitness	2	Like most people on the review board, I‚Äôm upset I cannot use the app unless I do the free trail. I understand it says ‚Äúin app purchases‚Äù but normally that means for other little things like to go to pro not the whole app in general. If you kept the app this way I‚Äôd much rather it just be the $10 at the start so it‚Äôs over with so I don‚Äôt get excited to try an app and then not even be able to us it. I suggest that the free trail starts automatically, with a notification that what they are doing is truly just a week for free and then at the end of the week have the pop up that is shown at the beginning of the app. I‚Äôm not going to agree to paying for something when all I‚Äôve done is put in my name and other basic info. Your giving little taste of the app before shoving a wanted payment in someone‚Äôs face so of course a lot of people will be upset by this. Even if the free trail was just a day it would be better then not being able to get into the app without agreeing to something. I‚Äôd rather spend those 10 dollars at my local planet fitness to work out there instead of it going toward an app that I probably would forget I even had.	positive
212	1099771240	health_and_fitness	2	It looks like a really good app that would help me out a lot but the con is I don‚Äôt want to be opening up my phone and stopping why exercise to check how long I‚Äôm doing it or be pulling it out of my pocket. This app would be 80% better if you offered it on Apple watches and such also. Easy to look at, don‚Äôt have to pull out my phone, and just makes the workouts seem more realistic. Because if I‚Äôm gonna e doing these workouts and I have to check my phone if I‚Äôm doing something right or if I‚Äôm doing it on time then it‚Äôs not worth it. This needs to be offered on Apple watches if I‚Äôm gonna be willing to pay 5 dollars a week. And that too. Way too much money a week for a workout that cost $0. If your gonna make it 5 dollars. At least to do it every month. But not every week because then your just taking money from clients. There‚Äôs gyms that charge less then this app monthly. But in conclusion the pro is that the workouts are things that will push you and that‚Äôs a good thing. So all together lower cost, make more accessible to other devices, and prove that the app is not just for clients money. Thank you	positive
213	1099771240	health_and_fitness	2	First of all, I really didn‚Äôt like paying $5 per week for this, but it did motivate me to actually open the app and do my workouts. However, I did think that was too much money for an app workout. Secondly, I liked the workouts at first but it was strange that the warm-up part of it was more intense than the actual workouts themselves. I‚Äôm not a fit person and actually injured my knee the second time I used this but I kept at it, pretty religiously at first, injured knee and all. I was doing three workouts per week at 20 minute intervals, using the lose weight exercises. It got really boring and tedious after a while to the point that I didn‚Äôt want to work out anymore. I also saw zero results. Didn‚Äôt want to spend money on this anymore because it got boring. I tried to change it up and do the gain muscle plan, but that had the exact same exercises as the lose weight plan. If you want to spend money on a workout plan that you can do at home on your own time, I don‚Äôt recommend this one.	neutral
214	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	Many people complain about the 5 dollars a week in which they would gladly spend the same amount or more on a cup of coffee in the morning. There‚Äôs a free 3 day trial which was enough for me. The app is flawless and although I haven‚Äôt used it long enough to see any major gains, I have gotten fitter and more agile. The workouts and exercises are easy to customize to be easier or harder depending on what you feel like. They even walk you through workouts and give you instructions. So far I give 5 stars for a great app. Keeps me extremely motivated, love it. Stop crying about the 20 dollars a month and try applying for a real gym and see how much they charge and the terrible contracts. This is a cheap gym on your phone, not everything is free to use, especially if it actually works. Buy it, use it, gain from it.	positive
215	1099771240	health_and_fitness	4	"So, this app is amazing! The variety of routines and customized workouts are great! I‚Äôm hoping to pursue some of the monthly challenges, mainly the belly workout, and it‚Äôs going good so far (I‚Äôm a few days in). I gave it a 4 out of 5 because I‚Äôve noticed the timer stopped a few times. I was doing a daily work out and saw halfway through that the timer was stuck at around 2:15. I tried to fix it, but it didn‚Äôt fix, eventually freezing and not letting me move on to my rest. Eventually the timer fixed itself, but I left the workout (losing all my progress) due to the issue. I will still continue to use the app, because it‚Äôs so professional and looks really good!

Overall, I recommend the app to anyone hoping to lose weight fast and in a convenient, healthy way, but I hope some of the bugs get sorted out (unless I did something wrong, then my bad)."	positive
216	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	"I read the reviews before getting this and I was impressed. Now I‚Äôm reading the reviews after using this app for 10 weeks now and people write such ridiculous reviews. Complaining that they haven‚Äôt lost weight even though they did it everyday, etc. Just a kind PSA: Every persons body is different!! Some people will lose weight just by exercising. Some have to eat healthier. It‚Äôs always different. I started this app 10 weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt lost weight but I feel healthy and that‚Äôs all I really care about and it‚Äôs all anyone should. It isn‚Äôt this apps fault if you aren‚Äôt losing weight so don‚Äôt blame it. I had no issues with how it charged me. It made me scan my finger print and it explicitly said ‚Äúpay $4.99 weekly subscription‚Äù and I accepted. Easy as that. 
Thank you for helping me get healthy!"	positive

218	1099771240	health_and_fitness	2	I know this may be weird coming from a 12 year old, but I do want to lose weight, and I can‚Äôt make a purchase because I don‚Äôt have my own money. I also don‚Äôt get to lose weight at a gym because I never get time to go with my dad, and no one can drive me. (I also hate going alone!) I‚Äôve been searching the web for some workout that might be some help for me to lose 60 pounds, and I ended up finding this app on an ad while trying to watch a video on big girl problems. (And for my age, I‚Äôm a ‚Äúbig girl‚Äù!) I clicked on the install button because it seemed legit and I wanted to try it out, but then I saw that I needed to pay to use it?! I‚Äôm only 12, so I can‚Äôt pay! It also says ‚Äò4+‚Äô on the app details, so I‚Äôm NOT too young! There wasn‚Äôt even an X button either, so I just wasn‚Äôt allowed to use this app! I‚Äôm sorry if I sounding rude, but I have tried almost everything to try and lose weight, but it‚Äôs not working and this app made it even harder! 2 stars! (I‚Äôm sorry.)	negative
219	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	The layout is perfect and keeps you motivated for completing workouts each week and doing challenges. My favorite things are that 1) has voice to tell you ‚Äúswitch legs‚Äù or ‚Äú10 seconds to go‚Äù and can do everything without looking at the app once used to it; 2) That the difficulty is actually accurate for someone who is a true workout beginner (FINALLY an app that recognizes burpees and jump squats are HARD!); and 3) you get to pick which one you want to do each day from a selection given for that week, and it says how many minutes to expect and can glance at the lineup of exercises, to see what you‚Äôre in the mood for, what‚Äôs sore, etc. Such a great app! I have kept it going almost 4 weeks straight now and love it. Always makes me sweat and get in a good workout from home.	positive
220	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	This app is amazing! It has everything you want if your like me they have something to loose weight and fat if you want abs or a bigger but they got that too and so much more! I love how this app lets little kids use it to you know I‚Äôm only 9 but I struggle with my eating and my weight and body fat but they don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm 9 and that‚Äôs something hard to find they just think no come one come all.I also love that in between workouts they have a 30 second test and then at they end they have cool down time but after all that they ask you how was this workout for so that they will know what you want.I think it is great how they also focus on just 1 thing too in challenges there‚Äôs one for summer body and other ones too.I think this app is amazing and I would totally recommend it!	positive
221	1099771240	health_and_fitness	4	"Overall I love the app but there are a few things that I would change.
1. You guys give the option to thumbs up and thumbs down a lot exercise but that doesn‚Äôt really do much. What I would suggest is that when an exercise is disliked there is the ability to alternate that exercise with a different one that basically works out the same muscles as the one that you thumbs down. 
2. You should also be able to adjust the amount of reps you do for each set of an exercise. I understand that you could change the difficulty of your workouts but doing this would allow for a more personalized experience
3. Some exercises require equipment. I do these workouts at home so I don‚Äôt have any equipment to do some of the exercises in my workout. I suggest having a no-equipment option."	positive
222	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	I don‚Äôt not recommend one because like this one person said it seems like it‚Äôs free but then when your done with filling in the steps it says you have to pay 4.99 monthly to get a fit body also my one of my friends got this app and paid and she did this everyday for 20 minuets and when her training was done SHE DIDNT LOSE WAIGHT AT ALL she was tried and exhausted she couldn‚Äôt move any bone in her body and her doctor recommended to work at the gym instead of working out at home and also this app is trash my friend went to the gym and she actually lost wait so basically I hope this app gets deleted because this does not help it makes it get your hopes up like ‚Äú oooh yes I can finally have a good body and get ready for summer‚Äù nooo it doesn‚Äôt this app only makes you lose 2 pounds every single day and Like I said DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TRASH APP AND DO NOT PAY ITS A WASTE OF MONEY !! If you want to lose wait and get ready for summer I recommend to go work out at the gym or get a professional trainer to lose wait !!!	positive
223	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	I use to do track in college but after 2 kids I gave up the gym life style I just walk 3-4 times a week. But I needed to loose some weight off my abdominal when I saw this app A huge smile came across my face like the grinch üòÇüòÇ this actually work wonders for me I am on my 6 day and I am already feeling the abdominal effect. I don‚Äôt see the cost as a problem. I believe it works in my favor because not many gym allows you to bring kids and as a single parent this app works in my favor. Like a home base gym just a finger screen clip away. so this app is a win win for me. When my free trial is up I will continue. The best part about it which I love is the cool down after that intense abdominal workout it allows you to just relax ‚Äúchild pose‚Äù is my favorite. It‚Äôs easy and efficient. Love it 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è	positive
224	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	I regretfully downloaded this app without actually looking into reviews. Just based myself off of the stars. You only get one week free trial and it automatically suscribes you for a renewal which is $5 A WEEK!!!!! Not only is the price outrageous, they dont have an easy way to unsubscribe through the app!!!! Youd have togo to your own phone settings and search up your subscriptions. Mind you, im having issues accessing my subscriptions from my phone. Now i have to contact apple support so they can help me cancel this before the payment goes through. Not only is this soooo hassling, they still have the nerve to explain on their app subscriptions info that ‚Äúthats how it works‚Äù!! Since were all used to downloading a FREE app and we are asked prior to accepting anytbing if wed like to choose the free trial then be charged then we can make an informed decision. However, downloading this app alone WILL AUTOMATICALLY SUSCRIBE YOU FOR THE FREE TRIAL AND THE ACTUAL $5 WEEKLY SUBSCRIPTION!!!!! THIS IS A MAJOR SCAM!!!! SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND DONT DOWNLOAD THIS GARBAGE!!!	positive
225	1099771240	health_and_fitness	4	I was over weight for many years and I wanted to maintain a body that I would not be embarrassed of, ashamed of, or feel I had to cover and hide from other people. I needed a work out plan that would help me feel comfortable and appreciate my body. This app has helped me reduce my weight in a healthy way and has made me feel happy about wearing a bathing suit with friends and not being worried that I look to fat in it or that I should be covering it up with a oversized jacket. I am now able to share clothes with my friends and actually fit in to them and I am happy when I go into a fitting room try on a piece of clothing and then realize I need a SMALLER size and not a LARGER size like I would have needed in the past. The app has changed my life for the better and I hope it does the same for you!	positive
226	1099771240	health_and_fitness	3	"There is some room for improvement. For instance, they give you a ‚Äúplan‚Äù for the week, but if you decide to do a different workout during one of your days, you can‚Äôt use that work out in place of one on your plan, and it looks like you missed a day. 
You should be able to do whatever work out you see fit. Having recommendations is nice, and I do like those, but I was very sore from the day before from raking and leaf blowing my yard, so I did something a bit easier, and it‚Äôs showing I didn‚Äôt complete a workout simply because I didn‚Äôt do one of their ‚Äúplan‚Äù workouts.
I also don‚Äôt like that you can‚Äôt put if you were unable to complete a set of exercises. For instance, there is a workout with 3 sets of 15 sit-ups each. By round 3, I did 10. But I can‚Äôt put that in. Instead it shows I did that full set, just very slowly. 

Things I do like:
Easy to use, and very clear on directions on how to do exercises.
There is a big variety of exercises to choose from, and lots of challenges. I just wish you could do those other workouts and it count towards your goal of working out however many days you set during the week.
It should be a little more customizable for 5 dollars a week.
I doubt I will continue with this after my free trial if these things don‚Äôt change."	positive
227	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	I have been looking for many different workout apps to see which one I like better and suits me best to help me lose weight. Well, when I came across this one, I thought, ‚ÄúThis one looks good and trustworthy. Why not try it.‚Äù And so I did. I entered in my info and all the other stuff and was ready to get started just to find, you can‚Äôt even use the app. I was beyond disappointed when I found that out. I refuse to pay money for an app, doesn‚Äôt matter what kind and I am not going to do the 7 day free trial because who can lose that much weight in 7 days? I mean, seriously? I would love to be able to use this app so I am going to say this. Hey developers, if you want some good reviews from people like me, who won‚Äôt pay or do a trial for an app, make it free and if they want more stuff, they can pay to be a subscriber. It really isn‚Äôt that complicated. So please, do something about this or we will all know why this app is really here. So you can just steal our money.	positive
228	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	This app tricks you into a free trial claiming you have access to 420 workouts while that may be true this app also claims you can cancel your subscription at any time which is odd seeming how you cannot find any buttons or instructions for that. i have deleted the app in hopes of cancelling the subscription but i have had to unlink my credit card to my phone because it keeps withdrawing money even after the app has been uninstalled.  As interesting and well put together it may seem it makes you pay an obscene amount of money over the course of two months that i‚Äôm not willing to pay on a subscription to any fitness program even in the real world.  This app really got me and I do not recommend using this app.  Unless you pay for it you cannot even view the apps contents.  I do not wish to receive a basic reply from the developer saying we apologize download again and try it.  It is copy and paste and is in my opinion disrespectful.	positive

Second, I love how the workout times or identifies the number of reps needed for each stage of the exercise! It was just wanted I needed and it really motivated me to keep doing my best. 
Lastly, I appreciate that the app only shows you one day at a time on the challenges. I am guilty of looking ahead for what‚Äôs in store and giving up because it looks too hard. This is my favorite feature.

But my second and third workouts were so wonky I‚Äôm going to have to cancel my subscription. I wanted intermediate workouts and it gave me extremely easy ones. I was half way through by the time I realized this one was easier than the last. I was going to just humor it but I had to quit the app midway because it got stuck and wouldn‚Äôt go to he next workout. I waited like 5 min. I figured something was wrong so X‚Äôd out of it and tried the next one. Again, too easy but fine since I had to start over and then it gets stuck on the last workout with the only option available was to quit. I hated that I couldn‚Äôt log or check my stats on these last two workouts. Then I went to the support page to try and talk to someone and the page won‚Äôt even load! Waste of my time & money.

I‚Äôd rather deal with ads, literally almost anything else than to pay $5 a week for an APP that‚Äôs supposed to help people get active and achieve their fitness goals. In my opinion it‚Äôs just a way to exploit people who want to be fit for their money, and it‚Äôs just a way to make it that much more difficult for people to find something they‚Äôd like to stick with to help them lose weight. Plus, the only response I‚Äôve seen from app developers is an annoying and generic ‚Äúwe‚Äôre so sorry this doesn‚Äôt work for you‚Äù copy/paste response. I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND DOWNLOADING THIS APP unless you‚Äôre willing to pay the $5 weekly fee.	positive
235	1099771240	health_and_fitness	3	The exercises are so clearly demonstrated, but their is not much guidelines as to what you should choose to further your workouts there is a long list of workouts and they‚Äôre not labeled with what part of the body they target, instead they are named after foreign city names that I can hardly recognize before I select each workout, I had to go through every single one and manually look at the workouts to see if those would help me achieve my goals, but no trainer actually guides you to choose more specific workouts tailored to your needs and goals... Also, although it doesn‚Äôt need to be nutrition based, I was hoping for some sort direction and advice on what foods can be better to incorporate in my diet to further enhance my progress. Yeah I hoped for a lot more.	positive
236	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	30 day fitness is an app where you can just basically work out for free with no equipment necessary. If you don‚Äôt feel like going to the gym, bring the gym to your room with just a click of a button and you will be exercising in no time. You will be more fit the way you want to be, and enjoy your body the way you want to be. 30 day fitness is beyond amazing. They have 30 day challenges where you can work out for 30 days, and see if you can keep up with the heat. I have been trying to go to the gym but I have obligations and things that need to be done, and now I can just get on my phone and follow the steps to becoming more fit and slim the way I like. üëçüèΩüëèüèæ	positive
237	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	This app is amazing!! Most of the time you tell yourself to work out and you just don‚Äôt. This app is basically like a gym that travels with you!! All the workouts are so effective and the calories lost are easy to keep track of! They time you on workouts and give you warm ups and cool downs which feel great for before and after! I have done so many workouts and lost track of time because they make me feel so good!! Definitely get this app $5 a week is not bad for how amazing this app is! It works so well and gives you workouts for how chill or intense you want to go! Basically like having a personal trainer with you at all times!! It is great and i love it so so much!! 11/10!!	positive
238	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	"Likes: how the warm up is set up. The voice calling out what was going on and giving intermittent countdowns was great! 
I got to view my workout and choose which one I wanted. 
They are very detailed in explaining how to do everything. And there are clips to show you also. 
You can set reminders and they were motivating :)
Dislike: when I viewed the work out it appeared that I was going to complete the activities in short burst (45 seconds) then move on. However, the first one kept going and going and going. For some one not use to exercise that can get old and tiring fast so I was disappointed it wasn‚Äôt the short burst that kept things changed up. Also there was no voice to keep me motivated like in the warm up :( it seems silly but that really helped. It was like a ‚Äúhey you‚Äôre almost there so don‚Äôt quit now!‚Äù And that would be good in the main part of the work out not just the warm up."	positive
239	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	"I‚Äôm 13 and this app is really helping me get in the shape I need for my gymnastics team. I love how you can choose your workout and what part of the body you want to work out. I have a couple of suggestions. Make up fun names, like instead of leg raises call them kick the air or something like that. It would make it more appealing to teens like me, and also can make you remember the name so you can do it later too. Also you should make a workout with nothing jumpy because I stay up past my parents and don‚Äôt want to wake them. I will do another rate after my 30 challenges. Going to start 1 today and 1 tmrw. The bikini body and the flat tummy
Ok that‚Äôs all thanks boo"	positive
240	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	Well, to begin... I was very excited to use this app. I looks really nice and helpful. I began to answer the questions it was asking and once I was done I was excited to start working out. But... that wasn‚Äôt the case... AT ALL. As soon i was done answering the questions it asked me to ‚ÄúGo Pro!‚Äù and pay $4.99 a week! First off how can I ‚Äúgo pro‚Äù with an app I never even got to try first. You would think it gave you the option to say no like most apps but it basically tried to force me to pay for it. I even tried closing it out and trying again but as soon as it reloaded the same thing popped up. After this I quickly deleted the app and said to my self ‚ÄúI think not‚Äù. I don‚Äôt recommend this app but I do recommend the makers of this app fixes that and at least let people you know ‚Äútry the app‚Äù way before you try to force someone to pay for it.	positive
241	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	"Ok so I‚Äôm thinking when I use the app I can start working out and at least USE the app, they didn‚Äôt even give me a chance to even use the app and this ad pops up and says ‚Äústart training like a pro‚Äù try one week for free, they give you no choice but to click on the premium plan, I‚Äôm thinking this app is for free and they are actually going to give me tips on eating right and working out..  NO! This is a scam they don‚Äôt give you a chance to even try the app out! I give this a one star! Fix this problem! I‚Äôm going to go download 8fit and see how that works, THIS APP WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME, PATIENCE, AND STORAGE!! Thumbs down üëéüèΩüëéüèΩüëéüèΩ
Edit: the people of this app gave horrible advice, basically guys this is not a free app they just want you to download it and when you do you have to pay! The reps one person literally copied and pasted the same words to each feedback, I dont recommend this app at all!!"	negative
242	1099771240	health_and_fitness	4	"The fitness plan aspect is great! Although sometimes I wonder if it is trying to increase the challenge after having used it for several months. I also wonder if they‚Äôve added any new workouts recently because they have been using the same ones in my workouts for some time. I like being able to switch out exercises within a workout but how about being able to create our own workouts? 

Having said that I think a good feature to add would be cloud sync. I have the app on my iPhone but would like to use it in my iPad but it seems unable to sync my profile to it. This would really make the app more user-friendly."	positive
243	1099771240	health_and_fitness	1	"It‚Äôs not really a free trial if you‚Äôre immediately prompted to subscribe with automatic enrollment. 
If you want people to actually try the app- have the first week open to everyone and then have everything after day 7 put behind the pay wall. I‚Äôm not even sure I‚Äôd like your app enough to continue using it after a couple of days- and who knows maybe remembering to cancel the subscription before it auto charges will just slip my mind. It should be considered fraudulent practices to insist on enrolling on a subscription without even allowing people to try the product risk free.
Have the free trial- sure- but guarantee it‚Äôs a free trail and not some malicious scam that benefits off of the mental ineptitude of its customers. I‚Äôm glad I know enough about ‚Äúfree trails‚Äù to not accept an automatic enrollment without even being able to try the product before enrollment. 
Such a scam.

Also- literally on their website the top question on their FAQ is ‚Äúhow do I unsubscribe from your product?‚Äù And they also list their full description of prices on the App Store- I find it absolutely hilarious that even their ‚Äúfree version‚Äù costs money. Never mind the fact that literally every price listed is to even use the service."	positive
244	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	Ive been a competitive athlete my whole life until I graduated, I was injured for a long time so it made it hard doing thing bc I was either training or icing. When I graduated I stopped working out bc I could finally walk with no pain since I was done training, it wasn‚Äôt until I realized how close summer was when I realized how much I actually let myself go, so many of my muscles were now half fat and I started getting a bit of a tummy, this app is helping me get my body back on track literally and figuratively!! Maybe next year I‚Äôll be without injury and in shape to start competing again!-thanks to this app of course!	positive
245	1099771240	health_and_fitness	4	"Pros:  I‚Äôm so glad to have FINALLY found a workout app that‚Äôs completely FREE!  So many others I‚Äôve tried in the past would only offer a free trial for, say, 7 days or so, but this one is free all year ‚Äòround.  There are over 400 different workouts/exercises to choose from; there are also challenge exercises, which specifically target certain areas on the body, and, in 30 days, you should definitely see results!
     Cons:  The only other feature I wish this app had was a free meal/nutrition plan.  However, that‚Äôs really my only complaint!
     Overall, I HIGHLY recommend using this app, especially if you‚Äôre a noob when it comes to all this workout stuff like myself!  ;D"	positive
246	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	Love this app! So user friendly and great work-outs catered to your own needs! Starts you off slow and steady which is great for a mama like myself, I haven‚Äôt worked out since my child was born almost two years ago and this app has rebuilt my confidence in working out. I just love how easy it is and it shows you exactly how to do the steps. For only $4.99/month that‚Äôs better than gym prices and I get a workout in the comfort of my own home! If you‚Äôre anything like me, you waste money on gym memberships without any idea of how to create a workout regime, but this app does it for you! Best $4.99/month i‚Äôll spend! Love it, and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love it too:)	positive
247	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	"As an ex-college rugby player, I‚Äôve spent most of my adult life in the weight room or running and mostly left the old standards like push-ups, plank, iron chair, etc  behind. 

Moreover, with the new COVID world in which we live, I needed a rigorous home workout to stay in shape - something that I could do without weights and get done in 20min or less per workout. After browsing online, I settled on 30 Day Fitness and could not be more thrilled with the results.  

I have been doing it consistently for a month and I can honestly say I‚Äôm back to looking like I did in my rugby playing days.  Not only does 30DF have the old standard exercises, but tons of new ones that I NEVER would have thought to perform or even known about.   And trust me, they are challenging! 

 Also, you can make it as easy or hard as you want as there are different difficulty levels that target different body areas of focus.  If you follow the program (and don‚Äôt cheat), you will see seriously great results.  I look and feel great!

Thanks 30DF!"	positive
248	1099771240	health_and_fitness	4	I started using this app on January 6, 2020. I was a couch potato with no stamina or fitness. This app started me out slow with small goals and gradually built me up to more strength and better endurance. I enjoy the variety of exercises and the feedback option with each workout so you can tone down or increase the intensity as needed. Each exercise has alternates that are easier or harder depending on your desired results. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about the app so far is some of the exercises require equipment, which I don‚Äôt have nor do I plan to purchase, and there isn‚Äôt an alternative. Great app for the money and definitely less expensive than a gym membership.	positive
249	1099771240	health_and_fitness	5	I love this app! I‚Äôve always had trouble working out because I don‚Äôt know the right kinds of workouts to do and it‚Äôs a lot harder to follow a workout schedule when you don‚Äôt have something to base it on. This app schedules your workout week and even has a bunch of other different challenges you can choose to do on your own. It creates your schedule based on where you‚Äôre currently at and how often and intensely you want to work out. And it‚Äôs more than half the price of a monthly gym membership, so it‚Äôs great for people who either can‚Äôt afford the gym or would rather do workouts on their own at home.	positive
250	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	This app is truly a lifesaver! I have an unusual manifestation of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and must stick to a low carb diet. I recently had a back surgery that went horribly wrong. I was forced to stay in bed for almost a month! I had to eat whatever was brought to me from the local restaurants and fast food joints. Prior to that, I had been on a strict KetoDiet for years! I gained 15lbs and felt terrible. After my recovery, I restarted my KetoDiet but the weight wasn‚Äôt coming off. I was also retaining water and I felt terrible. Then I learned about Intermittent Fasting (IF). Thanks to this wonderful app, I am losing 2lbs a week and I feel great! I generally do the 16 hour fast and then the 13. With the custom setting, I can do a 24 hour fast for religious reasons as I am a Christian and we are taught to fast and pray. But that‚Äôs my own personal decision. The custom Fast lets you use a slide to choose your own number of IF hours. So if your a newbie or might have issues with food, you can ease yourself into a full 13 hour or 16 hour or a longer period of IF! That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so wonderful about this app. You can also chose to count your IF hours up or down in order to keep yourself motivated.	positive
251	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôve been on a calorie restricted diet for years making very slow progress on my weight loss goal.  I decided to start recording the time of my last  food each day knowing that the time you eat may be as important as how much you eat.  It quickly became a burden and a clutter on my calendar so I went looking for an intermittent fasting app.  Since my original interest was just recording the time of my last meal I wanted a simple low/no cost app.  I found only one free app that didn‚Äôt have in-app purchases to goof up features.  Zero was that app plus it had the bonus of a 4.9 rating.  To my surprise this is a full featured app with a very high quality UI .  It has historical tracking of your fasts and can read or write to Apple Health.  The app had so much IF learning information that I began a 16:8 schedule.  I‚Äôm only on day 4 but my progress has improved while keeping exactly the same calorie goal.  No matter what your needs to track IF or TRF you are in for a treat with a professional app to assist you.	positive
252	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I have been using the Zero app since March of 2019 and have found this app very useful to reach my health and other goals that I have. The developers keep improving the app in many useful ways such as improving journaling, adding more knowledge to the learn feature and improving the stability and function overall. If you are wanting to track your first fast, look no further my friends this is the app to get. Also be sure to check out their Oak meditation app, it is amazing. 
One suggestion: I would love to see new features on the Apple Watch. For example have the fast tab show up on the Apple Watch that way I can quickly select the fast that I need. 

Also if you could please add the Oak app to the Apple Watch and have the ability to select and download a meditation or breathe to the Apple Watch. This would be awesome to have while away from my phone, that way I can put on my AirPods and do a quick mediation or breathe session while on break or lunch.
 Thanks for the hard work."	positive
253	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôve been intermittent fasting for about 2 years on and off. When I‚Äôm fasting, I find it extremely motivating to track my taste on Zero. I love that it has a few of the standard preset fasting times, but more recently I‚Äôve been using the custom fasts which is an excellent feature. I‚Äôve been back and forth on the 16-8 and 20-4 fasts so I set my custom to 17 hrs at the moment knowing I can build my way back up to 20 hrs. When I was regularly fasting and tracking on Zero consistently for about 3 months, I lost 15 lbs pretty effortlessly. I‚Äôve fallen off the wagon a few times but I‚Äôm back on now and am exciting to keep tracking. The UI is really beautiful and easy and I love that it automatically updates my weight from my Bluetooth scale through the Health app. The only update I‚Äôd like to see is to have a more interactive view with the recent fasts feature. I feel like this page could be more helpful. Overall, 100% recommended to anyone looking for an IF tracker.	positive
254	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôve tried countless diets and none of them ever felt good. I have severe anxiety and major difficulties with memory and would get torn between eating out with friends or sacrificing my diet, both options sending me into an attack. Until I found Intermittent Fasting. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve felt truly free and in full control of my eating, with the added bonus of giving me tons of energy. And there‚Äôs no way I would‚Äôve been able to lose as much weight (20 pounds in less than two months!!) without this incredible app. It‚Äôs simple, efficient, sends beautifully easy notifications, and even has a dark mode. The app shows you how many people are fasting with you, has options for the different kinds of fasts, helpful information, and much more. If you‚Äôre even remotely curious about weight loss, control over eating, or IF at all, you need this app. It costs a whole 0 dollars, so why not give it a shot?	positive
255	1168348542	health_and_fitness	1	One of my favorite apps. I used it all the time for my fasting journal. I just got done deleting it after the new version forces you to login your personal information‚Ä¶ Not something anyone wants! I kept declining and every time I declined it would refuse to allow me to set the timeframe in custom fasting option. If I did not allow notifications it also prevented me from doing a custom fasting option. it now tries to link you through Facebook etc. All the different options that you added cannot outweigh the fact that you‚Äôre definitely mining for more information on your customers and this is a deal breaker. I‚Äôm not going to be forced to give my information and allow notifications when I don‚Äôt want them. The old version I just entered what time I started, what time it ended and it worked fine now I have to go look for another app or some other means of tracking my progress for fasting. Whoever came up with this so Called upgrade needs to have their head examined. People do not like being forced into corners where they have to allow notifications and or give their personal information!!!!	positive
256	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"Fasting is like meditation for me - really difficult habits to stick with.  This App has helped keep me motivated through the tough times, through the periods of hunger that would have made me give up in the past. I love the visual aspect of the timer, the prompts to force me to check-in on how I am feeling, the data, and the articles and virtual ""support"" peeps.   The app has made visible times of the day that give me the most trouble and tips from other users have helped me deal with them.   The bottom line is that the fasting has created a stepped improvement in my energy levels which has carried over into my work productivity and relationships with friends and family and coworkers.  I eat when I get home at 4pm and end up making much healthier food choices (food has never tasted so good after a 20+ hour fast).  This has become the too App that I engage with throughout my day."	positive
257	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"The previous version of this app had a much more refined UI. I gave the previous version 5-stars while I give the current version 3-stars.

This version is still functional, and it provides more information. That said, the current UI is unnecessarily busy and lacks simple but powerful elements of the previous version. 

One of these elements is when a person reached their goal the whole UI would change from the red to green. While this is a seemingly simple thing, it had a powerful effect on my experience. With the current version, I no longer get the satisfaction from glancing at the app during my day following reaching my goal nor do I get the resultant motivation to keep pushing on beyond my minimum goal. 

Another example is the interface for initiating my fasts. The previous version of the interface was more simple and in my experience more inviting to initiate a fast. For me, it was actually a small joy to press start on the previous version. Now I am faced with several pieces of unnecessary data surrounding the start button. It fees more like a chore than a pleasure now. There is too much noise surrounding the experience I am seeking

I really value this app, and I believe it can help people. I hope these deteriorations and others are addressed and not worsened. The first version was so much closer to nailing it"	positive
258	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I just love this app. I chose the 16/8 fast and this app makes it so easy to fast. It will tell you the ending time based on when you start your fast whatever time that is and whenever I feel like breaking my fast before the time I look at how much time I have fasted and how much time I have left and just drink some fasting tea or bone broth and keep doing it!! I also placed reminders to let me know when I had gone halfway or to just check in to see how I am feeling while fasting. I love how it has the tracking that lets you know how many days you have fasted and the badges given for the days you have fasted. My next one will be the 25 day one and it is coming fast. After that is the 50 day then the 100 day and so on. It will be a great since of accomplishment to meet all of those goals, all thanks to this app. I love it!! Thank you so much!!!	positive
259	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I was introduced to this app by when I started intermittent fasting. This app takes all the guess work out of figuring what time to break or start fasting. I needed flexibility so that I don‚Äôt have to stick to an exact time every day. When your ready to fast you press start fasting and it will indicate the time you will need to break your fast based on which fast you choose. You can also customize the type of fast that you want. The app also lets you know how much time you have gone over past the scheduled fast if you don‚Äôt break when your scheduled to. Whenever I have my last meal then I press fasting and the count down begins. Even if I stop eating at 2 o‚Äôclock in the morning the app will tell me the next time I need to break my fast. This app is extremely helpful and has been so useful in my journey with intermittent fasting.	positive
260	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"About this app or about fasting in general, go for it. 
This app is a very well designed helper with first time fasters. If you cut yourself off, and forget to start the clock, you can edit the start and stop times by tapping the corresponding number on the screen. If you forget to start the app- or that you intended to fast at all, (hello me) there is a gentle reminder shows up on your lock screen. 
Overall, I started a 16/8 and feel amazing, AND I‚Äôm cutting out (yikes!) thousands of calories I‚Äôm not eating in the evening. I‚Äôve been starting around 4p and although the app congratulates me for completing at 8am, I go for a few more hours. I‚Äôve found I‚Äôve lost weight, but most of all I have more energy, I don‚Äôt crash midday. Yes, at night I feel my stomach whining for food, but I know if I get thru it, I will feel great in the morning. 
Try fasting, try this app."	positive
261	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	First started using Zero in November 2018. The app was less tricked out then. But I lost 48 pounds and Zero came along for the ride. Really helpful. After a while fasting became so natural that I gravitated away from Zero. Unrelated to this, I started putting on the pounds again after managing to keep the weight off for a whole year. Just yesterday downloaded Zero again (love what you did with the place), set me a 24 hour fast and, whereas in recent weeks I really struggled on my own to even skip dinner, somehow a stupid app helped put me on the right path again. Just completed my first 24 hour fast, about to embark on a second one today (probably risky but I want fast results). Anyway. Awesome app. Something about that nice orange timer that help lock down that commitment. Can‚Äôt explain it. Thanks to the whole development team though!	positive
262	1168348542	health_and_fitness	4	"I love this app. And never had an issue with until yesterday. I haven‚Äôt been able to basically use the app. I‚Äôm giving one star only because when I click app support there‚Äôs no way to tell them about a bug. So hopefully they see this!!

What‚Äôs happening is the app is having a really hard time starting/ ending a fast, changing a fast, and keeps kicking me out of my account. I hit end fast and it‚Äôs saving them with an incorrect time and type of fast. For example: I ended my 13 hour fast that started at 8:25 but then saying I have ended a 18:6 fast while having a 18:6 fast still on going from 10 pm. And while I can edit the times from the journey section I can‚Äôt edit the type of fast. Gave 1/5.

Edit: With the new update everything was fixed!! Thank you so much! Now a 4/5 because I‚Äôm unsure if they improved how to report bugs."	positive
263	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I follow a keto diet and lifestyle and eat in an 8 hour window. Zero helps me track my 16 hour fasts. You can create a custom fast time period and then press Begin Fast when you‚Äôre done eating for the day. When you meet your goal, an alert pops up to let you know you have been successful. I am VERY grateful for this alert because I would probably forget to eat otherwise. My appetite has really diminished on keto, and since I‚Äôm a First Responder, I can‚Äôt risk rushing off to a emergency and suddenly realizing I‚Äôm famished and haven‚Äôt eaten in 20 hours (it‚Äôs happened and it SUCKZ). Zero helps me remember that I‚Äôve given my body a rest from digestion and it‚Äôs time to refuel for the day‚Äôs adventures. I simply get my meal ü•ìü•¶üç≥ü•ë‚òïÔ∏è, press End Fast, and chow down. After dinner I just repeat the same steps. 
So simple and so effective üëçüèº"	positive
264	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I absolutely love the app, however I would like to recommend adding in the ability to make your custom fasts longer than 24 hours. Specifically for those people who love doing longer fasts, such as 36, 48 and 72 hours. I myself am a big advocate of longer fasting, however the moment I got my iPhone, I knew I wanted this app. The sunset counter is amazing and the app is beautiful. But again, I‚Äôd love to be able to track and be notified of fasts longer than 24 hours. Seeing the pop up say that my fast is up is the most satisfying feeling in the world. Thank you for such an amazing app and keep up the good work!

EDIT: This review was typed up BEFORE the 3.0 update. This app literally because the BEST fasting app on the market as soon as they allowed the custom fasts that go as long as 7 days. üòé"	positive
265	1168348542	health_and_fitness	2	Previous version did what it did and did it perfectly ‚Äî no bloat, no issues. Now? Boy. Slow to open, interface is overdesigned and inconsistent, you need an account (and to agree to the customary sure-to-get-worse-over-time-once-selling-your-data-becomes-lucrative privacy policy) just to use the thing, and occasionally things like notifications just don‚Äôt work. Why do I need to know that 85,000 other people are fasting right now? I don‚Äôt, certainly not if it means the app is slow to load every single time I open it. This isn‚Äôt a social network, it‚Äôs a utility. Would rather have paid for the previous version of the app than get this trojan horse for free. Sticking with it for now, if only because the watch app hasn‚Äôt been mucked with (yet), but I‚Äôm also looking around for alternatives, which I never felt any need to do before this update. Zero version 2 seemed too good to be true ‚Äî free, polished, no strings attached ‚Äî and I guess it was.	positive
266	1168348542	health_and_fitness	3	I really liked this app when I started using it last week. I like being able to track my progress with my fasting and it‚Äôs exciting to see that I make it each day. However, the app kicked me out today and I was unable to log back in. I thought I had signed in with my google account originally, but when I logged on that way, it signed me up for a new account. So I tried my regular email address I use for these types of things, and Supposedly I was putting my password in wrong, but I tried the reset password button several times, and it never worked. After messing with this for an hour and a half, I finally gave up and signed in again under the gmail so I could get the app working again. Sadly all my progress recorded is lost. :( if this happens again, I‚Äôm done with the app and re-rate at 1-star. Hopefully this was just a one time glitch.	negative
267	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"This app is amazing! It‚Äôs well organized and it really helped me so far with my fasting and weight overall! Because of its organization, it‚Äôs been really easy to find what I need, like if I want to go on a 13 hour fast, just a click of a button and bam, it starts recording and setting the time. Along with some tips and answers that some might have on the ‚ÄúLearn‚Äù page, that really helped me find out what I‚Äôm not and what I am supposed to do while on a fast.
 This app also lets record down weight changes, moods, and reminders to keep track of how you‚Äôre doing and such which I find really helpful!

Again, overall, I would definitely recommend this app for anyone who wants to lose weight by going on fast or just experiencing a fast."	positive
268	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	Very easy to use which I love in an app. Shows you how long you have left down to the seconds, minutes and hours. Shows you how long it‚Äôs been since you last fasted. Keeps record of how you feel when you‚Äôre done with a fast, or you can simply skip that. Also if you break a fast early you can keep it recorded or delete that fast. Has a history of how many fasts you‚Äôve done and if you reached the time goal for those fasts and how far you reached on those time goals. Very easy and fluid and beautiful interface. Easily the best fast tracking app that I‚Äôve used. Also shows how many people are fasting at any current moment! 385k are fasting using the app today which is incredible. Thanks creators! Love this app	positive
269	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"What else can you ask for? This app was created people focused from 2 men. One with the idea of how to bring this idea to life and one with the savvy background of how to build and manage a successful application. The two together started on this endeavor to create what you see now. 
The flexibility of fasting times are a must for me, which this app has focused on. 
It‚Äôs all about options and how to incorporate a healthier lifestyle into your way of life. 
Some things to keep in mind: all diets are lifestyles and are not meant to be a short term fix for a long term problem. 
The concept of fasting goes back to our primordial days where food was scarce and people ate in binges- which goes to show that the body can withstand long periods of not eating and still maintain health. 
Recent studies have shown the health benefits of maintaining a regimen of fasting and I encourage you to read up on the articles that have been posted through this application. 
I also enjoy the fact that all the data syncs seamlessly into other health apps, like Apple Health. Other apps don‚Äôt have the capability to do that yet. 
In conclusion, if you want a healthier lifestyle, you can‚Äôt go wrong with the ‚ÄúZero‚Äù app."	positive
270	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I have one problem, night time snacking. This has been a huge roadblock for me in achieving my fitness goals. And nothing helped. I tried writing down motivational quotes to implement this, trying to be mindful about this, but ultimately I‚Äôd give in and eat that small chocolate square. But then one chocolate square isn‚Äôt enough, so I‚Äôd eat the entire chocolate. Regardless of failure in achieving goals, this is clearly unhealthy. 

Then one friend recommended this app. I started using it for circadian rhythm fasts. Which is more natural (eat dinner and then don‚Äôt eat anything for next 13 hours) to how I assume humans must‚Äôve lived as hunter gatherers. The gamification of this has motivated me greatly and at the same time I‚Äôm also achieving my weight/health goals. Can not recommend this app enough."	positive
271	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I‚Äôve enjoyed using this app over the past three weeks, though I‚Äôve been fasting intermittently alongside keto since August with my wife. The interface is simple and doesn‚Äôt get in the way of what I want to do. The export feature is easy to use.

The lastest update includes a disclaimer, which is a professional move by the publisher. Please read it carefully. Don‚Äôt attempt the 16-hour fasts without careful study and speaking with a health care professional. Much of the science behind fasting is positive, but certain conditions may complicate.

My one recommendation on improvement would be to add a widget for quick glances at fasting progress rather than being forced to jump in and out of the full app. Perhaps this could be a feature requiring payment."	positive
272	1168348542	health_and_fitness	4	I like that I can start fasting and just keep the clock going (as I am doing extended fasting) but no matter how far I go, it‚Äôs not counting the days. I started a 96 hr fast last Saturday and when I broke it to eat, it showed all of the hours under Saturday. Like....why? It‚Äôs covering days, why not show that my goal is 24 hours and I completed x many days? If they can fix that, I will change this to 5 stars. I haven‚Äôt found any other free apps that will allow me to have an open clock on fasting and track it for me...so I do really like the premise for the app. I just wish it tracked the days as well as the hours. At first glance it looks like I did a long day Saturday and then ate until my next fast started on Wednesday- when I was fasting the whole time and only broke it to eat something in a 5 minute timeframe.	positive
273	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I love this fasting app and the amount of updates it gets.

Here are a few things I wish for:

1. The ability to edit the ending time of the fast, without having to manually cancel it out and then restarting it with extra or decreased time on the end time.

2. The ability to manually enter dates for fasting statistics. The newest update added the week, month and year stats option, but it‚Äôs skewed as you can‚Äôt get stats just for the year of 2020 or for the whole month of let‚Äôs say February. It will give you results for the whole month of the day you are searching. So February 16 would be January 16-February 16th, that needs fixing.

3. More badges/challenges, and the ability to know what they are. For example January had two challenges but I wasn‚Äôt aware of them until they popped up at the end of the month. I love to be rewarded for fasting and it gets people engaged and it‚Äôs great fun to unlock and strive towards goals and get a cool badge in return.

I jump back and forth between 68 and 92 hour fasts on a constant basis and open this app multiple times a day to keep myself grounded and staying proud in my fast. 

Just love the app. Keep up the great work."	positive
274	1168348542	health_and_fitness	4	"The iOS app itself is great and I couldn‚Äôt imagine a more simple app. I personally love the UI and the color theme works very well and is appealing. The preset most commonly used fast times are a nice bonus for people to get started with and being able to add custom fast times are a no brainer

The AppleWatch complications leave much to be desired. I originally downloaded this app because it‚Äôs one of the few that has a complication for the watch (making it easier to start/stop fasts). However, the complication is just a basic progress bar (no numbers) which makes it completely useless if you regularly fast and can just glance at the time gauge progress. I really hope they invest in better complications which would really make this app stand out amongst competitors"	positive
275	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	This app is ALLLLMOST perfect. I love everything about it so far, especially the accountability aspect and fun factor. What I really, really wish were added features is being able to share your ‚Äúbreak fast‚Äù meal with people who are fasting within the app, the ability to communicate with each other and being able to share or not share journal entries...All of which would help to motivate and help those that are struggling by being able to reach out to each other for added guidance, help with meal planning, recipe ideas, maybe even a way to keep up with your water intake. All to create a lasting fast community that will slow to get bored. I‚Äôd then give it ‚Äú10‚Äù starsü§©. Keep up the good work. You‚Äôre doing awesome!	positive
276	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I love Zero, it‚Äôs become probably my most used app (other than social or navigation apps). It helps me stay on track with my fasts and the fast notifications motivate me to reach my fasting goal. I also like that I can link to AppleHealth and track my weight loss. The education section of the app is a nice feature as well - I like reading updated research and articles on fasting methodologies and tips/tricks for successful fasts. Intermittent fasting has worked more effectively for me than any diet/exercise regimen I‚Äôve used in the past and the Zero app has played a big role in that. I have a long way to go to reach my health and weight goals but I am confident in my ability to reach them and I know Zero will help me on this journey.	positive
277	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"The app was so simple and user friendly until recently. Your update has made it unnecessarily more convoluted. People want simple interaction w/ their fasting app. Not a working relationship. Please consider simplifying it again. It should be visually ‚Äúeasy on the eyes‚Äù

The app has helped me so much with accountability by the way. Ive been recommending it to everyone i discuss fasting with. Hoping the next update gets rid of the unnecessary frills. Thanks.

Cont: wife and I just downloaded the fast-habit app and it‚Äôs features are what this app used to have... All of your recent negative reviews are echoing the same thing. I‚Äôll even gladly pay the 2.99 to not have such an account and arduous working relationship with my fasting app"	positive
278	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I have never written an app review before. But the design and functionality of this app is so beautiful I just had to. I started intermittent fasting to try and change my relationship with food and eating. This app has done just that. Even on days that I don‚Äôt want to keep doing- seeing how many people are fasting at the same time as me- or that I‚Äôm already 75% through is so encouraging. I‚Äôll check my streak, or the soft green that shows how many times I‚Äôve made it through. Now- I barely think about it. I eat less, but I just think about food less. I‚Äôve learned that so much of my eating was just boredom plus dehydration. And I‚Äôve grown comfortable with not needing to feel uncomfortably full. This app is simply the best.	positive
279	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"This app is super easy to use and does exactly what it should. If you forgot to start/stop when you did IRL, you can easily edit the time after you press the button, and the customizable notifications of when it‚Äôs time to start/stop fasting help with that, too. Apple Watch integration is also simple and clean, with a complication for those of us who are counting down the seconds until it‚Äôs time to eat.

The curated list of articles and videos is great for people who are new to IF.

One thing that‚Äôs a little tricky is if you mistype a weigh in, you have to go into the Health app Weight show all data and delete it there, but once you figure that out, it‚Äôs easy to fix."	positive
280	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I've lost weight and body fat with Zero.

I very rarely leave reviews for apps, but Zero deserves the five stars I'm giving it. The app is simple, intuitive, educational and gameify's the fasting process so you're more likely to stick to your daily fast. The main screen features a ""fasting ring"" which closes when you have achieved your chosen fasting time. There is some psychological reward about seeing your fasting ring become full and knowing that you did a good thing for your long term health.

I also really enjoy the curated charts, graphs and statistics in the app. It helps me to get a better sense of my overall health picture. The app does integrate and pull data from the Apple Health app (if you allow it, of course).

Finally, one of my favorite features is the education tab that brings forward a lot of very educational articles when it comes to fasting. I really enjoy Dr. Attia's daily/weekly vlogs in which he talks about health, fasting and current events.

Overall, I've noticed a difference with my body composition and can owe it to the beneficial effects of fasting aided by Zero!"	positive
281	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	This is a great app! I was new to fasting but read up on it. I started using Zero to help me. Zero is the reason I‚Äôve done the 16:8 fast just about every day (minus a few Saturday nights) since January. I really don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve stuck with the fast without this app. Sometimes the timing weirds out on me, but, as I just learned, editing of previous fasts is available. Yay! But I somehow lost a day, I don‚Äôt suppose there‚Äôs a way to add one? I‚Äôm a bit bummed because it messed up my longest streak.‚òπÔ∏è Every so often, when I‚Äôm not fasting, it shows that I am. It‚Äôs like the end time doesn‚Äôt take. That‚Äôs happened to me a few times now. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a perfect app for tracking fasts. Thank you!	positive
282	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	According to Zero, I've been officially fasting for 47 days. I did a few trials of intermittent fasting before discovering the app through a subreddit, so I thought I'd give it a try. Glad I took a chance on it. It's simple, informative, aesthetically nice, and actually feels like a motivator in those tougher fasting periods. I also like that it has resources to keep you informed while you're fasting. If I could make one feature request, I think it'd be awesome to set certain fasts for certain days (for instance, 18:6 on the weekdays with 16:8 on the weekends). Don't know how hard that'd be, but it'd be cool if it was in a future update. Other than that, the app is great and I don't see myself leaving it anytime soon.	positive
283	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I love this app.  I‚Äôve been experimenting with fasting to see what works best for me. This is super easy to use AND to edit days and times if you forget to start or stop a fast.  I wish it had pre set options for longer fasts, BUT, you CAN just start a fast and then let it go for days.  It will record it in hours and minutes.  Most days I shoot for a 20 hour fast and then sprinkle in a few 1 day fasts and then occasionally see how long my body will let me go.  (So far only to four days, but it gets a little longer every time I try and it is an amazing and empowering feeling to know I have that in me). Anyway, the app works well for keeping track of my fasting efforts!	positive
284	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"This App is Amazing and the best fasting App!! What I like about it is It‚Äôs clean and simple design which is so important to me. 
I don‚Äôt have to toggle through a billion pages to get to the setting that I need. There‚Äôs no clutter and users have the ability to edit if you make a mistake and hit the wrong thing üôÇ
I‚Äôve changed devices since the 2.0 version.
I love the new upgrades coupled with keeping the integrity/quality of the App. Everything is easy and assessable under the proper category. Like most Christians, I use it for spiritual reasons and just want to track my fasting and weight. I started originally during resurrection season. It really helped me get throughüôÇ 
Zero listens to the user"	positive
285	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I really appreciate this app. This one is hands down best! I have tried other fasting apps that are so confusing they are ridiculous! Not this one! Found it a few months ago after having already begun time restricted eating. Started 16:8 in August 2019. (Finally! Haven‚Äôt looked back! Best lifestyle change I could have ever made for myself!)Have lost 21 lbs and so far have maintained that loss. Logging in with Zero helps me stay focused and on target. The articles are helpful and informative. So easy to use twice a day! Metrics are clear. I can‚Äôt say enough. It‚Äôs a great community to be a part of, too. I really feel supported. It continues to get better. Highly recommend üëçüèΩ	positive

This has been a go too and i am constantly sharing my fasting w friends so it keeps me accountable! I have great will powere and improving self-discipline as my back up when willpower dies, This Has Mentally Helped me stay on track and reading theninfo offered! Love it sonfar! Doing what i need it to do and thats not eat when i am not hungry or just bored and habits i am kicking!	positive
287	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I found out I LOVE this app. It‚Äôs that little jolt of excitement when you‚Äôve reached your goal and accomplished something. It even congratulates you! It‚Äôs super simple to use. Customizable. And has great, short, informational articles about fasting in general.

Background: I was skeptical at first b/c I‚Äôm skeptical about anything related to fasting. However my bestie has been a long-time proponent and seen great results with multiple types of fasting modalities. So I was growing increasingly curious. Even though I don‚Äôt have her ‚Äúover-the-top‚Äù enthusiasm for fasting, I have had success when sticking to a 16:8 eating regimen, but was having trouble doing it consistently to see those benefits. This app helps me stick to my goal."	positive
288	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"The thing I love about intermittent fasting is the ease of it. You don‚Äôt need anything, all you need is to remember to not eat. I like trying new things and love the flow guys, so I downloaded the app. Man! It‚Äôs such a nice way to get my data tracked. Love the simplicity of the design. Love the sense of community you get from seeing all the people who are fasting at that time as well.  Love the learning section as well, it presents valid information that has need redacted beautifully. Love the journal component. 

If I had one wish: I would ask the makers of zero to create a zero like app for meditation. I would love to track my meditation data now as well.

289	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I always wondered how the heck do we really know what‚Äôs happening in our cells. Well these scientists really made a true discovery that is real. I have been doing this fasting and it is now my way of life. Not a quick fix. I feel amazing it‚Äôs crazy how swollen I was and didn't even know it. Make sure you drink lots of water. This app is amazing. Also make sure you drink vitamins. I can‚Äôt tel you how much better I feel and also I already lost 5 lbs in the weekend I started this. Try to jump start your metabolism and do a color cleanse. This will only work if you eat healthy Whole Foods. Don‚Äôt eat junk! Get the app! Change your life. Read the research. ‚ù§Ô∏èüíôüí™üèºüí™üèº	positive
290	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"My favorite thing about this time is is simplicity to use, and the fact that the yonder doesn't end until you tell it to. You set a default goal, and it alerts you when you've reached it, but the timer will run until you press the Stop Fasting button. This is great because no matter what your default setting is, you never have to change it based on your schedule or if you want to go for longer than usual or shorter. The default time does serve as gauge for your fasts (your past fasting info is on screen below the timer) which is really nice!
Also the color scheme is very lovely, pleasant to look at."	positive
291	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I like the Zero app a lot. All that you need is easily accessible and with just the right amount of information. The timer is a color ring that closes as you move along in your fast, with a count up or down - you choose. Your fasting history is a selection to the right - that keeps your daily, weekly, monthly... statistics and journey. You can choose an available IF option or custom your own. And there is ample information and links in the ‚Äúlearn‚Äù section on various fasting protocols. 

If you‚Äôre fasting regularly, the Zero app is a great companion. I certainly think so, and I‚Äôve been fasting daily for 6 months."	positive
292	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I like the new update, but I wish that the history did not show the current fast that I am on. To see the fast that my current fast is going to replace, I have to click on the full history and count back seven days.  The previous version did not include the current fast in the history. It also make it confusing because it shows the current fast on the history which also has the average fast, but the current fast is not part of the average. So, please change it back to version 2.0 where the active fast is not on the history section.  :)	positive
293	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"This app has motivated me to stay on track. I was a fan from the start, I loved the simplicity but still get myself wishing it had a bit more functionality. This latest update has everything I want. It‚Äôs still so easy to use but the new extra features and connectivity with my other health apps takes it from helpful to amazing. 
I also love the science section. It makes it possible to stay informed and current from legit and reputable medical sources. When I feel a bit unmotivated I read an article, listen to an interview or watch a video to remind myself how important this is for my health. 
Thank you."	positive
294	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôve been doing IF on and off for a while but this app has served as a gentle reminder and motivator to keep me committed. I was recently diagnosed with high blood pressure and, like many of us, could stand to lose a few pounds. I like the simplicity of IF. No need to track what I eat; just eat during a set period of time. I definitely do feel hungry at times, but I just check this app and ask myself if I can wait until my eating window opens. The answer is usually yes. I stopped fasting while on vacation in Hawaii‚Äîbut just started it up again when I got back. No guilt about taking a break. Every day is a new start.	positive
295	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I really do enjoy using this app! It‚Äôs simple to use, has a dark mode, has helpful and informative articles.

My only complaint is that it‚Äôs common knowledge that people shouldn‚Äôt fast on their period. I don‚Äôt want to lose my streak just because I have a period. Is it possible you guys could add a feature or a switch that I can activate when my period starts, and it freezes my streak or something? I guess I could just click that I‚Äôm fasting even if I‚Äôm not on my period, but that feels counterproductive to what I‚Äôm trying to accomplish with fasting.

Anywho, thank you guys for such a great app!"	positive
296	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"My Son recommended the Zero app for losing weight, I didn‚Äôt think that I could fast like this.
Turns out, with the help of Zero app it was much easier then expected. You learn very quickly that you were eating out of habit and far too often.
This Zero app is great for retraining yourself not to slip in bad habits. I went in for a check up and my doctor ran an EKG test and told me that I had to lose weight because I actually had 2 small heart attacks. I weighed 237 lbs when I started 4 days ago. Now I am down to 231 lbs. 6 lbs in 4 days! As my Son said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre guaranteed to lose weight sticking to the Zero app.‚Äù"	negative
297	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I have several decades of weight management under my belt and have tried multiple styles of eating and workouts.  Based on chronicling my journey, it is clear that not eating after 8 pm was key to weight management for me. Then almost a decade later from that epiphany based on my personal data, I learned about the science from Dr. Rhonda Patrick -  this was because of circadian rhythms and time-restricted eating. 

The app is an easy-to-use tool for accountability and journaling. It also allows you to be more precise about the ‚Äúcircadian‚Äù part. If you have an Apple Watch, you enjoy even more conveniences from the app.  Great design work!"	positive
298	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I just started intermittent fasting and while it‚Äôs difficult to get used to, the app makes it so easy to keep track of my hours and weight loss. I am so thankful for the fasting timer alerts, to both end and being, because while I naturally stop eating before my 8 hour window, I always forget to start the timer. And that last couple of hours are always the hardest and I do my best to avoid staring at clocks, so getting those notifications for endings are super helpful.

If anyone is looking for a user friendly, simple but effective app to track their fasting, I 100% recommended this app!"	positive
299	1168348542	health_and_fitness	5	"I love this app it helps me track my fasting much easier! I also like the new feature with the goal weight however I think maybe a little adjustments could be made. I don‚Äôt know if it is just me but I watching my scale drop is a satisfying thing! Yet because I have an ambitious goal my weight doesn‚Äôt seem to fluctuate much from the graphs. I was hoping that by changing my goal weight maybe the scale of measurement on the graph would also change but nope. With larger scale increments it keeps me alert about what I eat during my eating window because a bit of gaining is magnified as a steep incline. 
Thanks for the great app though!"	positive
300	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	Hi! Your app is fantastic. I‚Äôve used different meditation apps over the years. Calm addresses all of the issues I had with previous apps and puts everything (sounds, music, reading, and guidance) in one place, which is amazing ‚Äî thank you! What would be great to add to the library of guided meditations is a version of the 7-days of Calming Anxiety specifically for people who are homebound. My elderly grandmother was very social, very active her entire life, and is now homebound. She needs to lower her anxiety, but I can‚Äôt share this program with her because phrases like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing you need to do, nowhere you need to be, nothing to fix‚Ä¶‚Äù etc. are actually what is depressing her. It‚Äôs a more difficult problem to solve, I know, but if there‚Äôs a way to write a 7-day program for people who don‚Äôt need to slow down ‚Äî slowing down is their problem ‚Äî and also ensure that the reading is engaging, not too soothing; otherwise she‚Äôll fall asleep, which she does because she‚Äôs depressed. This would help more than elderly people; many people struggling with recovery from operations and chronic illnesses have similar issues of immobility. I just don‚Äôt want to give her something labeled ‚Äúfor the elderly‚Äù or that references a life situation, because her‚Äôs isn‚Äôt going to change; it‚Äôs not temporary. I‚Äôd love for it to be called something like ‚Äú7 Days of Calming Anxiety at Times of Immobility‚Äù or ‚ÄúMeditating When You Can‚Äôt Move.‚Äù Thank you for considering this!	negative
301	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	"I mean what I said in the title. I‚Äôve tried synctuition, headspace and this other popular meditation app... None of them even compare to Calm. I love calm. I knew I was hooked when I tried their free trial and did my first session. That‚Äôs how amazing this app is. I recommend this app to anyone that has ears LOL I‚Äôm always telling my brothers and sisters to download it. It puts me to sleep every night like a BABY. I‚Äôm truly amazed and so thankful for this app. It‚Äôs easily worth the investment every single month/every year because it‚Äôs an investment for your mental health. For me that‚Äôs always worth it. I love the sleep stories, I love how LONG the meditations are (up to 45 minutes) headspace‚Äôs longest meditation is only 15 minutes or something like that. That‚Äôs terrible. 

What would be cool in the future to see is: more personalization for each session. 1. Being able to pick the background music (whether that‚Äôs actual music in the background or rain, or the beach) not all meditations offer this option and I think it would be great to be able to choose! I also think that being able to adjust the volume of the background sounds and the volume of the voice, that‚Äôs one thing headspace did right‚Äî they offered this. 

I love this app and I‚Äôll always love it. Thank you. My favorite things to listen to are the guided sleep meditations, these really help me fall asleep. ‚ù§Ô∏è"	positive
302	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I used to use Headspace for meditation (which is a fine app - especially if you‚Äôre just getting started) but Calm has helped me take things to a whole other level.  The Headspace meditations were essentially all the same - there are maybe four variations but he cycles through those four and you get the same mix regardless of what series you‚Äôre working on (stress, anxiety, work performance, etc).  I feel like the Calm meditations go much deeper and I‚Äôm noticing a huge difference in myself after switching over to Calm.  Historically, I‚Äôm somewhat self critical and I have a higher than normal baseline for general anxiety (although I wouldn‚Äôt say that I have an anxiety disorder by any means).  At times, these things make me impulsive or reactive in certain ways that I don‚Äôt like.  I feel like I‚Äôm much more self aware after switching to Calm and I‚Äôm able to identify when I‚Äôm experiencing certain feelings and deal with them in a healthy way.  Aside from that, I‚Äôm much more enthusiastic about my meditation practice and I‚Äôm meditating more often since I learn new skills every day rather than sitting through the same old boring meditation.  Calm gives you a toolbox with multiple different tools that you can use in various situations.  I love it and highly recommend it to anyone.	positive
303	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I absolutely love love love this app!!!!‚ô•Ô∏è once I could not go to sleep so I turned on some of the calm music and I fell asleep 10 minutes later. I was amazed. I have been getting better sleep since than. Also whenever I am feeling stressed or anxious about someone or something, I listen to one of the daily calms or the next day on the meditation trial. Right away it‚Äôs as if you were brought into some beautiful relaxing world where there are these voices saying ‚ÄúIt will be ok no matter what. This will pass.‚Äù And it does its amazing how calming and peaceful this app is. Next, mood check in. The mood check in helps me express and release good and bad feelings and thoughts. Enjoy the good ones and let go of the bad ones. It even gives you a chance to write a little about them. It‚Äôs like your own personal diary, but way better. Last but definitely not least, I Believe this app can make you a better person. To be happier, to live life longer. It can be a real life changer. And just know that it‚Äôs never to late to start fresh again.  It‚Äôs never to late to change yourself. But most of all, it‚Äôs never to late lo be the big change in the world, that you have wished for. And calm can help with all of that. This is a total recommendation for anyone.	positive

It has changed my perspectives and state-of-mind in ways that have been beneficial to every aspect of my everyday life and well-being, in a countless number of ways. By committing to the habit and genuine effort to a mere 10 minutes of meditation a day, I have observed a significant change to the way my brain works and handles day-to-day tasks and situations. I have gained peace-of-mind, appreciation, more quality and meaningful time spent with my family, the ability to approach things in ways that are more practical and productive and less stressful.... And this is just to name a few ways meditation has been useful and life-changing. My 10yo son insists on using it before bed every night in order to help him unwind and get a better night‚Äôs sleep. I use it for tension relief and to soothe migraines, or to calm myself down when I‚Äôm angry or upset. The mind is so powerful and can truly enhance one‚Äôs quality of life and well-being in ways you could never imagine possible. By obtaining a better mindset and maintaining the ways in which your brain works and thinks, you can come to realize what sort of impact it can make on your overall health, happiness and life.	positive
305	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I am a high school teacher at a high preforming high school in my area.  My students are often so stressed out and sleep deprived I feel so helpless to help them.  This year I decided to dedicate one day a week to meditating before we started class.  We do this every Thursday for the first 10-15 minutes of class. The response has been so positive from my students I am thinking of doing it two days a week next year.  The students LOVE Thursday!!  They have told me it‚Äôs the favorite part for their week.  Some students have even gotten the app for themselves.  I have heard so many times this year, ‚ÄúI needed that!‚Äù or ‚ÄúI needed to hear that today.‚Äù  After on session one of my boys said, ‚ÄúMan I was so upset about losing those 5 points on my English test and now I have let it go.  This really works.  What did you all think about?‚Äù  You know you are doing something right when teenagers open up and start talking.  Thank you for this product and allowing me the opportunity to give my students at least 15 minutes a week to destress, calm down, learn to love themselves and just breath! Can‚Äôt wait to see what the future has in store for me and my students as we take this CALM journey.	positive
306	571800810	health_and_fitness	4	"This App is my absolutely favorite to use when I‚Äôm going to sleep. I got it solely for the sleep stories and I‚Äôm absolutely obsessed. It‚Äôs like being a kid again and getting a beautiful story read to you by a soothing voice. While I use the app mainly for sleep stories I‚Äôve used the meditation, background music, and breathing exercise options on the app as well. I used to use Headspace for a lot of my meditation sessions but with Calm having so many additional features I switched over fairly quickly. 

The only problem I have with this app is that I can‚Äôt set up a playlist/cue of the stories I want to fall asleep to. Sometimes I can‚Äôt fall asleep right away so I have to go through the process of unlocking my phone, setting up another story, and trying to settle down once again just to set up another story to be read. It quickly becomes irritating, especially on nights when I can‚Äôt fall asleep easily and have to go through the process of setting up an additional three stories and eventually giving up in the end. 

So if that can somehow be added then it‚Äôll get my full 5 stars. But having nights where I‚Äôm on and off my phone throughout the night definitely makes me feel frustrated enough to keep it at 4 stars."	positive
307	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I recommend this app to anyone looking for a meditation app. I have even given gift subscriptions to friends looking to mediate because they are so in tune with their clients needs. They are always looking at feedback, offering content to meet needs and finding things to offer I didn‚Äôt even know I wanted. The narrators are wonderful & plentiful so if one doesn‚Äôt cut it for you, you can change. There is also calming sounds, perfect sleep stories and A daily check in to see how you feel and offer suggestions on what might help. Their Master classes are great for learning things like mindful eating, better sleep, how to relax, and even improving your performance in life. All star narrators like Lebron James, Matthew McConaughey, Lucy Liu, Bindi Irwin, Bob Ross, Jerome Flynn, Leona Lewis, Jason Kidd & more read sleep stories & give advice on how to improve aspects of your life. Sabrina Carpenter & Sam Smith give music mixes to help you sleep or relax. They even have a calm body to help you wake up, warm up/cool down from your workout, reset for the afternoon and wind down for the evening. This app is for your whole body not just your mind. Keep up the amazing work Calm. This app is worth every penny.	positive
308	571800810	health_and_fitness	3	I recently re-downloaded this app and like the free features (when I downloaded it years ago one of my favorite features was ‚ÄúScenes,‚Äù so as long as I have access to those for free, this app will stay on my phone). However, it‚Äôs a bit annoying that I now have a ‚ÄúDaily Calm Perception‚Äù notification on my screen that is locked and that I can‚Äôt remove. I don‚Äôt purchase app subscriptions, though I would be more than willing to support this app by individually buying content I was interested in as one-time purchases). If you don‚Äôt plan on allowing users to buy content separately, can you please at least give us the option to only view non-subscription content if we wish (with no content we can‚Äôt access clogging up the screen)? I read another review stating that some of the music was available to non-subscribers. It all appears locked for me. Can you clarify please? Also, are all 7 days for any of the meditations unlocked for free users? I just listened to the first day of ‚Äú7 Days of Calming Anxiety‚Äù but I don‚Äôt think I can listen to the second one (or even repeat day one w/o subscribing, which is a bit ridiculous IMO). Please consider alternative payment models in the future. I‚Äôd love to support the app, just not with a subscription.	positive
309	571800810	health_and_fitness	4	"I have had this app for more than a year and have very much enjoyed listening to many stories, perfect for lulling you off to sleep. I enjoy/prefer non-fiction stories and have heard all offerings multiple times. I find the whispered stories super creepy‚Ä¶ But maybe thats just me. I haven‚Äôt listened to any music selections.
For the high subscription price though, the app should be nearly perfect, when in fact there are features missing. First, I wish that they would allow you to remove the stories that you don‚Äôt care for from the ‚Äúplaylist‚Äù so you wouldn‚Äôt have to sift through them each time you look for something you want to listen to. Additionally they are EXTRAORDINARILY SLOW to add new stories so consequently I have listened to the same ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù stories many many many times. I wish also that there were an option to list stories by ‚Äúnewest‚Äù so if they do add a new one it will readily be evident. The ‚Äúnap‚Äù stories should not be listed with the ‚Äúsleep‚Äù stories, since those have a ‚Äúwake up‚Äù feature at the end.
With a few minor tweaks to allow a user personalize their preferences and more frequent content updates, this app could be exceptional."	positive
310	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	"I am a lifelong insomniac. I spend most nights staring at the ceiling for an hour or more before I fall asleep if I do at all. This app has helped so much in getting myself into ""sleep mode"" and calming down & stopping my brain from rewinding the day or cycling through the next day's schedule. I occasionally listen to music but I mostly stick to the readings. My only request is to get Matthew McConaughey to do more readings! I have tried listening to others and they just don't work. I'd say my biggest complaint is they are all reading as though they are reading to an audience that's awake and aware. They are either too loud (even on the lowest setting) or reading with too much inflection which excites one rather than lulling one to sleep. MM knew his audience and his reading is in a very soft tone, his voice is calming and relaxing and he also seems to lower his voice as the story goes on, barely above a whisper by the end. All in all his is the perfect presentation and the only one I can fall asleep to! So please keep this story in rotation and if you can convince him to do more, please do! Otherwise I am content listening to the same story night after night."	positive
311	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	"I found this app because someone I know recommend I try it for the sleep stories. I‚Äôm
a very busy person and my mind tends to race and sometimes I just can‚Äôt turn it off when I‚Äôm trying to sleep or relax. I tried one of the free sleep stories and I sacked out pretty quickly. I also tried the free background soundtracks and music when I was trying to concentrate. All worth the price of free admission. But then I tried the mediation. I‚Äôd always thought of meditation as new age mumbo jumbo. But many of the smartest people I know all have stories about when they started doing it and how it changed their life. So on a uncharacteristically unbusy Saturday I decided to try the meditation course. And now I realize how simple and profound it all is. It‚Äôs essentially just having then skill to not let your thoughts control how you feel. Not letting your emotions get the best of you. Once you can control your impulses, you are a different person. It‚Äôs really life changing. This course starts slow and you can see real benefits after a week or so. I know have my own story about when I started meditation and when my life changed for the better."	positive
312	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	"Over the last 5 months, I‚Äôve been on a journey of personal growth. There was a lot that I was complacent about in life and I was tired of it. At the beginning, I had heard from my brother about meditation and all the benefits of it. I was half-invested, not sure if I believed all the claims (I hadn‚Äôt read any studies). So, I tried it a couple of times, but hadn‚Äôt had that meditation where it clicked yet. After a couple months though, I did some more research and started to meditate more regularly. 

While I am finally feeling more comfortable meditating alone, Calm helped guide me the entire way. There have been so many days where the messages and techniques from Calm have been extremely impactful on my life. The creators of this app did an absolutely fantastic job. And that‚Äôs not to say that the ultimate goal is to only meditate by myself. After a couple of days of mediating on my own, I love to come back to a guided session of the 21 days of calm and hear a message/lesson again. 

All in all, I highly recommend using Calm if you want to learn great techniques of meditation and also be inspired to improve and grow as a person."	positive
313	571800810	health_and_fitness	4	This app was created to help people who are struggling with anxiety, daily stress, sleeping problems, or even depression. The app has many different resources and techniques given to help people. It has breathing exercises which can help people who are dealing with anxiety or stress. These breathing techniques are proven effective by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques. The app has calming music to listen to while doing work or to help fall asleep. For someone who is struggling with depression the app gives many tips with the focus on mental health. These tips are how to maintain a strong mental health.  I downloaded this app since I saw a lot of advertising for it. My first impressions of the app were just okay. Once I figured out how to navigate around the app and use all of the features I began to enjoy it more and more. One of my favorite features about the app is the stories to help you fall asleep. One of the parts of the app that I did not like very much is that you have to pay to get a majority of the features. Although they do have a free 7 day subscription, I feel that you need to use it longer to get a good effect from the app. Overall I think that app is pretty cool and interesting.	positive
314	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	"I LOVE this ap. I had a near death experience (NDE) a little over a year ago. The emotional path that can follow was a little tough, as was seeing and feeling the imperfectness of being a human more intensely. Thanks to a few friends who had raved about meditation apps at a family reunion (not mine), I search and found this ap a few weeks after the NDE.  I love the effective, short Daily Calm meditation (~10-12 minutes), so easy to fit in, so effective in creating a calming break for the mind which can bring at least a moment‚Äôs peace, and can also help bring a much longer peaceful perspective reset. There‚Äôs even a three minute emergency meditation, nighttime sleep meditations, specific areas of interest series as well as wonderful option of Master Classes. Check it out. My longest streak (it tracks this for you) was 27 day, just after the NDE, but some were just a day or two before I miss a day or two. 
Focusing on the breath ... your breath ... following it. So effective. And the reflections at the end, with the beautiful daily picture ... are daily gems. Thanks to Tamara Levitt, thanks to Daily Calm."	positive
315	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I picked up Daily Calm after I realized my insurance had such a high mental health deductible that it would effectively never cover weekly therapy sessions. So I looked for other ways to get through a really stressful series of major life events including the death of a family member. I thought I‚Äôd try meditation. I‚Äôve been using this app to guide short mediation sessions about an average of four times a week for over a year and it‚Äôs genuinely helped me. I can honestly say I‚Äôve gained a life skill that I use every day even when the app is closed - closing my eyes and focusing on the breath for a few seconds even while I‚Äôm on the train or in a waiting room or about to go to an intense meeting at the office. This app isn‚Äôt the only way to gain that skill by any means, but it‚Äôs the one I picked up and it‚Äôs been pretty great. If you‚Äôre going through a hard time, the other things that have helped me the most with the depression and anxiety are gardening, hiking, in-person tabletop gaming, and cannabis microdosing. Crazy sounding combo, I realize, but I‚Äôm in *such* a better place than I was a year ago. Thanks for helping, Daily Calm.	positive
316	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôve been using Calm for about two years now; It is hard to believe I‚Äôve logged several hundred meditation sessions. My mind still wonders. A lot. AND: I‚Äôve strengthened several key muscles: concentration, clarity, equanimity, friendliness (which I learned about from Jeff Warren‚Äôs incredible 30-day meditation course included in the app).  I‚Äôve recommended this app more than any other (I‚Äôve tried, enjoyed, and positively reviewed several of the popular meditation apps), and I‚Äôve heard from even occasional meditators that it has improved their skill and outlook. Another thing Jeff taught me: you don‚Äôt measure how effective/useful meditation is based on how many times your mind wanders when you sit, you look at how often and how smoothly  you  find yourself applying the concepts and activating the muscles you gain from sitting. The number of times I smile and notice something in a typical day is in the dozens. This app has definitely enriched my daily experience. It is worth trying, it is worth paying for, it is worth prioritizing in your life. (May you be happy; may you be strong; may you feel like you belong.)	positive
317	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	Ever since I tried the free version of Daily Calm I knew it was exactly what I needed. I have used the premium subscription for a year now and Calm has more than met my expectations but exceeded them by far. Every morning I am in guided meditation with Tamara and then I do the gentle morning wake up stretches which have made a huge difference in the pain I used to have from my back issues. I do the chair stretches at work and the back care exercises when my lower back is hurting. I also listen to the sleep stories every night and fall asleep before half the story is over. These stories are so soothing and relaxing. And there are so many different stories and meditations to choose from. I can‚Äôt wait to delve into the talks given by experts regarding mindfulness and breaking bad habits, etc. I just wish I had more time to spend on Calm because I enjoy it so much. It has been worth every penny and i just renewed my subscription. Daily Calm is exactly what I need on a daily and nightly basis. I absolutely love it and look forward to another year with these wonderful people in this amazing app.	positive
318	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	Do you experience any stress in your life? Or, perhaps your life is spinning out of control. Or, if not, you may find yourself somewhere in between. The Calm app does not solve life‚Äòs problems but it does help reframe them to give us a better way of living with and living through our problems. One of the greatest features is the Daily Calm which is a 10+ minute meditation. This does not mean zoning out to some strange mantra and pursuing another mystical realm! Instead, the user is guided through various styles of mindfulness. At the conclusion, guidance is given on how to approach life or reframe our issues in order to better live life rather than life dominating you. If you do choose to subscribe, there are probably hundreds of targeted series (and growing)-/ everything from sleeping better to dealing with relationships with others, dealing with loss and even dealing with yourself. Using this app consistently (I use it frequently, not daily‚ÄîI sometimes forget or get caught up in my business!) will surely help you not control your life but learn to not be controlled by your life.	positive
319	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I absolutely love this app. I‚Äôm a Christian and a senior in college. Previous meditation experiences have made me so uncomfortable because they ask me to recite something or meditate on something that goes against my religion. This app doesn‚Äôt do that! Also, I struggle with the epidemic in out world of Hurry Sickness (google it. It‚Äôs a thing.) I do too much, say yes to too much, worry myself, stress myself out, and don‚Äôt give myself quiet time. This app reminds me to care for my heart and brain. I meditate daily, every morning using the daily calm. I then do a timed meditation and spend time in prayer and meditating on my God. Starting my day like this makes me so prepared to deal with the hurry of life. I also do at least one other meditation throughout the day. I love the sleep meditations. I haven‚Äôt tried the stories yet, and I‚Äôve been using this app for several months. I think I‚Äôll focus too much on the voice and story to fall asleep. So! I just do a guided sleep meditation. I have no requests for how to fix this app. The price is reasonable and I‚Äôve had no issues with the app.  10/10 recommended!!!	positive
320	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I never knew much about meditation until a mentor introduced me to the practice. It is exactly that, a practice. I found it difficult at first to stay focused but found that it came more easily the more I did it. I became hooked and noticed the positive impact it had on all aspects of my busy, hectic life. I knew I wanted to continue guided meditation and my mentor recommend finding an app that I liked. After trying free-trials of several apps I knew hands down this was the one for me. The selection of background sounds, and her soothing voice were exactly what I was looking for. The length of sessions are sufficient to fully relax and recharge yet not too cumbersome to fit into a busy schedule. I come to look forward to the sessions at the end of each day as my ‚Äúme time.‚Äù  I like that there are pre-programmed sessions aimed at specific topics or goals and there are daily sessions as well. The fact that the app keeps track of my progress helps to keep me motivated to never skip a day.   I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this app, well worth every penny!!  I am hooked.	positive
321	571800810	health_and_fitness	3	This app has really changed how well I sleep.  And for that I am truly grateful to the developers.  They definitely deserve all the accolades the app has been receiving.  I do have one major criticism thought that I wish I could get them to pay attention to at this time.  They apps content is very limited in comparison to other similar apps.  The major area of limitation is the sleep stories section.  There are only a handful of sleep stories that can not even get you through a month of nights without having to listen to the same stories over and over again.  Many users I know are focusing in on the sleep stories section because they work.  However, all have the same complaint as I do; just not enough stories and having to listen to the same stories over and over again.  Hey for little kids, this particular flaw is fine. Heck, I have read the Fantastic Mr. Fox to my youngest literally over a 100 times to get him to sleep.  For us adults, the developers of calm need to realize we need more variety in our sleep stories.  If this app only had more, I would be elated to change my rating to 5 out of 5 stars without a days hesitation.	positive
322	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	My father died March 4, 2019, of vascular dementia and Parkinsonism. This app got me through a year of grief and anxiety - the likes of which I had never experienced- so deep was our hurt watching our father die so slowly and losing him bit-by-bit over time. His sickness was made more stressful because my parents live in another state and I was driving 12-hours every weekend to get to them. Plus, I was in grad school, working full-time and had (still do) very involved children in both high school and college. Beginning last summer, the grief and worry was becoming so great that I couldn‚Äôt breathe. My mind was racing so fast, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. Even using prescriptions to sleep and relax, I knew I needed more help so went online, really, sort of desperate. I found ‚ÄúCalm.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt miss many days meditating after that. The sleep stories replaced my prescription meds for sleep (eventually), and Calm was an anchor as the end for Dad got closer and when he died. As a college professor, I recommend it now to all my students. I see Calm as an essential part of my healthy life.	negative
323	571800810	health_and_fitness	4	Okay, I will be honest this app is so relaxing. At first, I thought that it would be some kind of boring app that wouldn‚Äôt have any use‚Äî well I was wrong. This app is so good. There are different types of meditations that you can do for seven days, sleep stories that will make you fall asleep, classical music, relaxing backgrounds that you can change anytime, yoga lessons, and to just breath normally. I started about a week ago, and I have been so relaxed after that. I don‚Äôt get as mad when my lil sis hides in my room and steals things, I don‚Äôt get as frustrated when my parents ask me to do double chores with no extra allowance. But there is something that I will have to point out before you download this app‚Äî most of the things are NOT free! Most sleep stories are not free, most meditation thingies are not free (you can only have one sample then every other day is locked, ask of the relaxing music costs money, it is the same for the yoga. You need to buy a year‚Äôs worth of unlimited pro, month, or week. To me it is kind of unfair, but they still allow a few sleep stories and I can get relaxed even without the pro needed.	negative
324	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I am loving Calm. It is perfect for where I am right now. I love the 10 minute daily calm. I look forward to the new topic each day and 10 minutes is a very manageable amount of time even in my busy schedule. I am working through the 21 day beginning meditation series as well. I like that I can do the daily calm each day and then add a 10 minute beginning session when I have time. Tamara‚Äôs voice I find very pleasant and reassuring. I like being able to choose some soothing background sound like birds chirping or fire crackling. And finally I am enjoying the sleep stories and find they are helping me fall asleep more quickly in the evenings. The only negative is I‚Äôm not too fond of the music selections. I find most of the music to be somewhat jarring and irritating rather than soothing. I would love if some peaceful soothing music were added as options. So right now I just don‚Äôt listen to the music. Overall, this app has been fantastic for helping me learn to quiet my mind and stop destructive thought loops. I am definitely feeling calmer and more present than ever before.	positive
325	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	It almost seems like everyone in the world has anxiety and depression nowadays. I do t want another problem like addiction to drugs so I was endlessly in search of alternative help. I just want to be more in control of my emotions. Hormones play a big part in my emotions. An instance that makes me furious, sad, depressed, hopeless, and aggravated one day could be the same instance on another day and it wouldn‚Äôt bother me a bit. Due to my fluctuations in emotions due to hormone changes I didn‚Äôt want to take pill(s) daily. So I stumbled across this app and gave it a try. NEVER LOOKED BACK. It‚Äôs wonderful for stopping me in my tracks and calming me down. But you do it often and the lessons follow in your life. I love love love the coach‚Äôs voice. I am a private person and don‚Äôt share my feelings which is helpful to some, but I don‚Äôt need to when I practice with the help of this app. You can choose how much time you want to spend. A lot or a little. There‚Äôs even an ‚Äúemergency calm‚Äù selection, I haven‚Äôt used but am saving it for when I need that best friend to say ‚Äúeverything is going to be ok!‚Äù	positive
326	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I was skeptical at first because of the prices for the subscription deal, but my dad did the math and it‚Äôs actually not as bad as it looks. Still a bit pricey, but not bad. My dad used to be a computer programmer, so he knows why people use the subscription payment model. I‚Äôm using the app right now and it has helped me so much! I have really bad anxiety and cope with distractions poorly.(I‚Äôm medically diagnosed with A.D.D. and Asperger‚Äôs syndrome.) I have a better understanding of why apps do things like this. I mean, if you were a developer and made something that helps people, wouldn‚Äôt you want to have something in return? I think most people would agree that they wouldn‚Äôt want to make a product and have people not pay for it. Gotta pay the rent somehow. I‚Äôm still not a fan of that kind of payment system, but I‚Äôm more informed about it thanks to my dads former experience of being a computer programmer. Like it says in the title, once you get past the subscription, the app does its job beautifully.	positive
327	571800810	health_and_fitness	4	"This app has been incredibly helpful for me; the focused texts are simple enough to be absorbable / not distracting in a state of meditation, when you need it most. The 7 days series is excellent. The texts themselves are poignant with the exception of some cultural references Ive heard (honestly, I don‚Äôt think this is any place to mention what Amanda Palmer from Dresden Dolls thinks) - trying way too hard with that.
My main issue which has kept me from being able to use about 50% of the guided meditations, including Daily Calm and most other practices, is that I just can not bear the speaking voice of Tamara Levitt. I‚Äôve tried & tried and i just can‚Äôt. It it is probably just me but she really rubs me the wrong way in how mushy and drippy her voice is...it comes across as disingenuous but I realize that the intention is exactly the opposite. It would be really nice to have at least one other choice for each program - ideally the other one would be more neutral. It‚Äôs a pity because I like the content very much, but otherwise, with no adjustments of added narrators it will probably keep me from renewing my subscription."	positive
328	571800810	health_and_fitness	4	I really like your sleep story‚Äôs everyone I started I‚Äôve been at least getting to fall asleep faster but I know you can‚Äôt do much about this but I just can stand the guy who is in most of the story‚Äôs I want to read, his name is Alan sklar or something like that and some other boys I can‚Äôt remember the names of I just want to tell you so maybe you could make most of them girls because I think they have a more smooth voice witch in Science is proven to be better to listen to at night and it soothes people to listen to witch in most cases reacts to better sleep including me but in all I think you app is helping millions in ways you can‚Äôt imagine better sleep can help with better minds you could save lives if they have better minds they can think before they end there life sleep is extremely important all you need to do now Is get a good add that will intrigue people that need help and they won‚Äôt just turn the volume down on the adds they will listen. Please take this into consideration I‚Äôve already lost someone to choice of death you could save people from that. Yes it might seem impossible Just TRY.	positive
329	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	My doctor had shared with me about the benefits of meditation.... I needed something to help when I was anxious as well something to help me relax. Shortly after that doctor visit I found the Calm app. It's been almost 2 years. It had been a stressful day and there was an introduction to the app and I took the 10 minutes and did the breathing and really focused on relaxing. I went back to work and I immediately told everyone about Calm.... I have been using it ever since! The time I meditate is my time to focus, to breathe and to just be in the moment. I had horrible insomnia and started the body scans... I tried the sessions without buying the subscription but soon found that I wanted more of the sessions after I did the first; so I bought the subscription and have never regretted it once! It's been a godsend. I love the bedtime stories and the daily Calm.... there is so much on this app that has helped me. I love that the app is adding new things. Thank you Tamara for sharing and helping me bring peace and calm into my life!	positive
330	571800810	health_and_fitness	2	I love the app! But that‚Äôs a lot of money. I think there should be an app that thinks about the people using it more, because some people can‚Äôt afford this including me. I‚Äôm trying to look for a app that helps with my anxiety and this app is great but I don‚Äôt have the money to get what I need on this app. This seems like a little much to charge $70. This helps people‚Äôs stress, anxiety, depression, and more. There are a ton of options you can use which is great if you have $70. You should have more free things and give more price options. Like you could have a certain amount of money for a week or a month or even even a few months, not just charge to only get it for a  year. And you could lower the price for a year even if it‚Äôs just by a few $. This might attract more people to the app and you would make more money. You would probably get better ratings too. If you have the $ to spend on this app spend it! It‚Äôs not going to be a waste of your $. This has sleep stories for people of all ages including kids, it has all different kinds of sounds, it has meditation, and it has breathing exercises. GET THIS APP if you have the money to spend for it. It won‚Äôt let you down.	positive
331	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	"1st off, I TRULY appreciate the app giving me time to try its features before asking for an App Store review. I absolutely HATE when you've used an app for all of 5 minutes and then it asks you to rate it. Absolutely awful, how would I really know? This app gave me the time to explore it and use it for a good week before asking for a review. Bravo!

As far as the app itself, by session 7, I REALLY zoned out into the meditation and almost put myself to sleep I was so calm. I remember when I first began I was anxious to check when I would be done. But by the end of the week, I was surprised we were done already. I'm excited about that. 

The music is calming, the guidance is very calming and helpful. And it's very easy to use and I love the reminder and quotes at the end. Again, I can't rate this app highly enough. I hasn't even asked me to upgrade to the paid version yet so I don't know how much it costs to continue meditating but I sure hope I can afford it. They deserve being compensated for the labor of this app!"	positive
332	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I have had anxiety for about 7 months and recently, has been growing.  I try to do as much as I can to calm myself down when I feel anxious.  I have seen ads about this app before, and wasn‚Äôt really convinced at the time.  However, I recently was shown an ad and thought to my self if I should get the app.  A few minutes later, it‚Äôs on my phone.  I really admire the people behind this game for creating an app for people like me, and it makes me feel hopeful that there are still people out there who care about others like this.  I also really like how even though they present you with calm premium, that they still have many options to choose from with out spending a single penny.  So, to conclude my review, I just want to say how I think this app will help me.  I am going to continually come back on the app for at least a month, and I can foresee me feeling better because of it.  I believe this app will help me a lot, and I would like to thank the creators again, for making this app.	positive
333	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	"I love this app!  I was struggling with anxiety and restless nights as I am working full time and going to school full time and couldn‚Äôt seem to quiet my mind at bed time. The meditations, sleep stories, and ambient noise have all helped me tremendously.  I‚Äôm getting the best sleep since I can remember.  

I do have one suggestion, though.  As they are meant to do, the sleep stories often get me to sleep, but once the story ends, it is just silence.  The ambient noise helps me to stay asleep, but I can‚Äôt find a way to have the ambient noise begin once the sleep story or meditation session ends.  It would be great to be able to make a playlist of sorts where ambient noise automatically kicks in at the end of the sleep story or meditation session. That way, if I‚Äôm already asleep or very close to it, there is no need to go back into the app to turn on ambient noise, risking the light from my phone putting back to an awaken state.  

Thank you, Calm!  Everything else about this app is fantastic and has truly benefitted me and my mental health."	positive
334	571800810	health_and_fitness	2	Today I found myself in a EXTREMELY stressful situation and I needed to be calmed down. I decided to download this app because I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I read the reviews and a lot of people were complaining about the locked features. I thought it couldn‚Äôt be that bad. I was wrong. Almost everything helpful is locked. I found myself not only stressing out about the situation I‚Äôm going through but this app. Now I know it‚Äôs not a lot of money but even if it‚Äôs like a couple cents a month, I stress about it. I‚Äôm not poor or anything it‚Äôs just that I have a lot of anxiety. I mean a lot. This isn‚Äôt a very helpful app if almost everything helpful is locked. All the music is locked which would help me the most. Very disappointing but I gave it an extra star because if we had some helpful things, it would be an amazing app. I saw a response to a review like mine saying that they make it so expensive so they can keep building the app. Omg these people who made this aren‚Äôt very smart. Have you seen all the 5 stars? If you make it cheaper, there will be more people buying the app and then the reviews won‚Äôt be as bad and you‚Äôll have even more money. $70 is just outrageous.	positive
335	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	"Having used this app for a couple years now, I have some experience that has changed me. I have learned that breathing well is as important as good blood flow in your veins. People don‚Äôt naturally think of it as important because our brains do it unconsciously and we don‚Äôt have to think about it. But when we stop to take a moment and breathe, we find that heart rate shifts, emotions are regulated, and perspectives change. It actually feels quite miraculous. 
As a Christian, I know that many people are leery of (even the word) meditation. However, it is my joy to carry the message of truth regarding meditation. Meditation (ie using my own breath) has carried me through hard times and bolstered my energy when I‚Äôm weary. It is using the body and breath to be the recharge, the Gatorade, if you will,  to the soul. Even Job 33:4 says, ‚Äúthe Spirit of God has made me, the breath of the Almighty gives me life. ‚Äú  
Breath is profound and simple all at the same time. Our breath is a gift and I believe a life lived well, tends this gift."	positive
336	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I was recently diagnosed with IBS. My GI recommended doing daily meditations to help relieve some of the stress and anxiety that can exacerbate my symptoms. I read some research articles on the topic and found one included in the American Journal of Gastroenterology which showed that meditation significantly improved symptoms in women with IBS. I decided to give meditation a try. As a busy medical student, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would have the time to make meditation a daily practice. I have made time for meditation each day since my diagnosis 2 months ago and have found it to be very helpful, especially when I am having a flare-up. It really has allowed me to break that vicious cycle of symptomatic exacerbation worsened by anxiety about my symptoms flaring up. Obviously, other lifestyle modifications (e.g. diet, exercise, sleep, and even medication) might be necessary to control and/or alleviate symptoms. I have had to make other lifestyle modifications too. Thus far, meditation has been a very effective aid in my IBS management. I highly recommend the Calm app!	positive
337	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	This is a must have app if you have bad anxiety like me and other things but there‚Äôs just one little problem.... THE PREMIUM I got this app recently and I‚Äôm already loving but there‚Äôs ones that I think are really cool but it says start 7-day free trial and if I forget about having it then I sorta wasted my money for nothing. But I also had  a little suggestion, you could still have the trial and that stuff but I was thinking of like having a little thing were each time u do one you get like 5coins and you can use them to unlock more and maybe still have some free and but ya, like make it to we‚Äôre you can unlock more sessions and stuff by like saying yay you got 5 coins great job! Just to like be like good job you completed a session, just to like make them feel happy, so ya that‚Äôs what I have to say but other than that this is a must have app hope you guys take my advice and I hope this app will have and update about my advice thank you tho!	positive
338	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I never, ever write reviews. But I am SO grateful for this service. I had awful insomnia for the longest time. I‚Äôve been using the Calm app for a month and I recommend to anyone who will listen. It just takes 10-30 mins of sleep stories and I‚Äôm out for the whole night. It‚Äôs been such a blessing. I don‚Äôt use the meditations or ambient noise, it bugs my husband, but I just go to bed 30+ mins before him and by the time he comes up to bed I‚Äôll be out cold.  I will happily recommend this app to any friends and family that struggle with falling asleep. I love the sleep stories. The price tag is well worth it and I use it almost every night.  I wish Matthew McConeghey would do more of them that were less distracting because his voice is soooo soothing but his sleep story is like distracting because of the content. I love the Jerome Flynn stories though, I listen to them frequently. I wish you would do more of the Alice in Wonderland series, it‚Äôs sooooo soothing. Thank you for such a great service!	positive
339	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I struggle with anxiety and insomnia. I've meditated on and off for years and felt better but recently had lost interest in my usual mantra meditations. I'd been thinking mindfulness would be good to try but couldn't quite get myself to spend hundreds of dollars for official classes. A friend told me about Calm and I decided to try it. I was surprised by the high quality of the instruction. It's like having a guru, therapist, and wise friend all in one. After a week I decided to pay for the full version. Incredible value for money. I've meditated every day for two months and been able to bring mindfulness to many areas of my life - my job, eating habits, and social interactions. Those are all still a work in progress but becoming more aware of how my anxiety affects me in those settings is a huge first step. I also love the sleep stories and music. I love knowing that if I wake up in the middle of the night I have this great tool to help me break the gerbil wheel of worrying thoughts and fall back to sleep.	positive
340	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	Two days ago, I ran into a specialists office panicking over clogged ears. Stupid, right? That‚Äôs how anxious, panicky people are. We think we are dying all the time. Went to bed with clogged ears and anxious. I was hoping a good sleep would calm me down enough for the next day. Nope. Woke up more anxious than normal with those clogged ears. While driving to work, I had a sudden urge to go to the ER and beg for anything to calm me down. I am one of those people who does not want medication, but I was desperate. I saw Calm on a commercial last night and didn‚Äôt think it would benefit because I was in bad shape. I tried the free version and it was ok, but i wanted more and I‚Äôm glad I did. I did the first day of 7 days of calm today and it helped me immensely. I no longer felt like jumping out of my skin and i got some relief. Every now and then, I feel a little anxious but I can now calm myself down and get back to work. And this is just day one. For those who are suffering greatly, keep and open mind and try this.	positive
341	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	About a year ago, I was teetering on the edge of what felt like insanity. I had just moved to a new town, had no friends beyond my significant other, I was struggling to find work, I was deeply depressed, and considered suicide at one point. I was searching for help outside of what I knew, so I tried downloading this app. I accidentally purchased a years membership and was initially infuriated by the sudden lack of funds, as I was also struggling financially at the time. Little did I know, that this would be the start of one of the most important journeys I have ever embarked on. I started out slow and found that the daily calm meditations were helping me look outside of my own perspective of how terrible I thought life would always be. Today, I meditate daily, sometimes with the app, and sometimes without. I never imagined that I would be able to fit this into my daily routine, but I am so happy that I paid for that membership. I will definitely be renewing it for years to come.	positive
342	571800810	health_and_fitness	4	I‚Äôve subbed to Calm for several years now (current streak 620 days so I use the app) and while there are more repeated daily meditations than there seem to be fresh ones, it‚Äôs ok. I get it, content takes time and resources. But... the unicorn status of this app and its pricing structure seems to emphasize the ultimate goal is to make oodles of money over delivering on the mission and stated aims of the app. This is sad... I get you want to make money, but it‚Äôs just not right to limit the free trial so strongly and to continue to price gouge subscribers when the app isn‚Äôt as fresh and slick as it used to be. It‚Äôs bloated with so many aspects (calm kids, masterclasses, sleep stories, music, and meditations) that it‚Äôs almost trying to do too much. Please add a search function because with all the content it is hard to find the simple body scan or loving kindness meditations easily. Yes they are favorited but after so many years even my favorites are bloated! To anyone offended that calm pulled advertising from Tucker Carson I suggest the loving kindness meditations...	positive
343	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I stumbled blindly into using this app. First was to help me sleep with the sleep stories and now for the past 7 months using the meditation section, it has changed my life entirely! I‚Äôve literally been reborn. It was a painful transformation as I let go to all that held me back. All that I was before has grown so much. My perspective has shifted and I‚Äôm no longer so frustrated when things don‚Äôt go as expected. I am now just breezing through life and things just seem to fall into place when I least expect it. Not fighting the flow of life anymore thanks to this app. I have a committed daily practice now and I don‚Äôt ever see it going away. Now if I could ask for one thing it would be a section added for fertility. None of the other fertility meditations are seem as good as these are. I can only imagine how well this app could do them and the woman who could use the support and guidance through trying to conceive to birthing a child. Please please add it to the app. üíó	positive
344	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I had been wanting to start meditating and wasn‚Äôt sure where to begin. While telling a friend this, she told me her holistic physician had suggested that she try the Calm App. I downloaded the app and began my Journey with Calm. It was a stressful time in my life. I wasn‚Äôt sleeping well and my thoughts were going so fast through my head. I used the sleep stories in those nights I had a hard time falling asleep or when I‚Äôd wake up and couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep. The sleep stories were very helpful. I also started meditating 10 minutes a day. There are a wide variety of meditations even on the free version. The app also helps keep you informed on how often you are using the App. There are specialists in different fields that do informative series. I could see how I was using my skills that the App taught me to help keep myself calm and present through the day, so I subscribed for the year. This opened up even more features. You have nothing to loose by trying Calm and everything to gain.	positive
345	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	I have a lot of trouble falling asleep. Since I began using the Calm app, I can listen to a sleep story, and by the end, I am relaxed and drifting off to sleep. I have really enjoyed the calming voices of most of the storytellers; however, last night, when I listened to Candace Rardon‚Äôs narration of the Temples of Shodoshima, I found her voice to be too high-pitched to promote sleep. I kept listening only because I found the content of the story interesting. I would suggest that narrators modulate their voices to a lower, more sleep-inducing pitch. Anna Acton is a good example. Her voice is wonderful. She narrates perfectly, is very relaxing to listen to, and modulates her voice at the end of the story to help you fall asleep. I also especially love to listen to Matthew McConaughey, whose voice is very calming. Please give us more from him. In addition, since it takes me a good while to fall asleep, I would appreciate more longer stories, about 40 minutes in length. I do highly recommend this app.	positive
346	571800810	health_and_fitness	1	Why do you have to charge $70? I loved it two years ago when it was cheaper. I got sick and had to let it lapse and now I go back to get back to the app to find it‚Äôs now so expensive. You won‚Äôt even look at my comment because you‚Äôll see all the other comments and skip mine because it‚Äôs solely about money in an already greedy world. You don‚Äôt even offer a monthly plan. Otherwise, I would have given a five star!!! But the cost turns my stomach on principle! There are many people with high anxiety and insomnia that this app might reach and help, and you‚Äôd be doing such a great thing for those people if this wasn‚Äôt so expensive all upfront! I thought that was what Calm was all about....helping! I‚Äôll look for another 5 star app! I will be deleting this app. You even took away the content I downloaded from when I had paid!!! I know you have to make money, but $70 and no way to do a monthly plan means you‚Äôre going to loose people. But with all the 4‚Äôs and 5‚Äôs, you won‚Äôt care about and comments that have to do with pricing as I‚Äôve seen your stock answer to the other complaints about the same issue!! So people who can‚Äôt afford don‚Äôt count to you! Until they do, you‚Äôve lost my business!!	positive
347	571800810	health_and_fitness	1	I‚Äôve had this app for about 2 months and absolutely loved it until recently.  When I purchased it something happened and they charged me twice for the app.  There wasn‚Äôt a way to contact them so I asked my credit card company to reverse the charges and they did.  Coincidentally at almost the exact time that the charge was reversed my app started performing horribly - it started killing my battery, literally to zero, after only playing 1 story.  For example, reviewing the battery usage indicator on my iPhone 10 says I‚Äôve used the app for 1 hour and used over 80% of my battery.  I have restarted my phone numerous times, loaded all the Calm updates, and have reported the issue to them via their help center.  I don‚Äôt believe in coincidences - I haven‚Äôt seen any reviews here that indicate this is an issue with anyone else.  This app developer must be a rouge programmer in his/her garage - scary stuff.  I‚Äôm going to get another refund if this performance problem doesn‚Äôt magically disappear.  And then I‚Äôm going to develop an app just like this to sell for a much cheaper price and compete with this product.  Shame on the price they charge for this app - that I have read in the reviews.	negative
348	571800810	health_and_fitness	5	"After a year of nothing but stress, I felt that I needed a way to take control back and give myself some peace of mind, calm and some sleep. I tried the free version for a few weeks and loved it, so I went ahead and purchased it, and haven't looked back. I usually do the daily meditation in the morning and one of the program meditations at night, followed by a sleep story. While I still feel that I am not sure I am any better at meditating, I do feel more at peace and calmer.

I do wish for 2 things for this app: 1, that they tell you or give you an idea of what to do with your mind's eye once you close your eyes. For me, it is worse than my thoughts. But my husband and I came up with 2 different ""views"" (i.e. a meadow near a brook with dandelions to put my thoughts on and ""blow"" them away during my next breath - the visual of seeing them float away helps put them to rest). Now that I can focus on that I can focus easier on the breath.

And the 2nd thing I wish this app offered was a dairy of some sort. At the end of each session, you ask how it was, but I want to also comment on how I was - was I distracted, or did I feel that I improved. Being able to see the progress helps the progress along. It also would be a good thing to look back over and see if certain lessons need to be re-explored.

But even without those, I think the app is great and have enjoyed using it."	positive
349	571800810	health_and_fitness	1	"This is probably a wonderful app if you have the money for it. But I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out whether it would be worth the money, and now that they have pulled a sneaky trick I probably won‚Äôt. I had been trying it out while deciding whether to buy in and pay for ‚ÄúPremium.‚Äù I have liked the limited parts of the app I have been able to access, but was hesitating because the app is kind of expensive for me. Unfortunately, when the app was updated they locked some of the aspects that were previously open. This doesn‚Äôt seem to be in the spirit of the intention of the app. If it‚Äôs purpose is to bring more ‚Äúcalm‚Äù to the world, why would they do something so frustrating? There are other meditation apps out there, so I guess I‚Äôll keep looking.
PS - After going back and looking at the reviews, I can see that this one review probably isn‚Äôt going to be noticed by anyone. There are only a few negative reviews, and like mine, they are mostly complaining about the high cost and the general ethos behind offering such an app at such a cost. Apparently this is a great app if you have the money for it, and there are a whole lot five-star reviewers who can afford it."	negative
350	304878510	social	4	"My girlfriend and I are long distance so we call each other on the daily until she visits. I‚Äôve used Skype over other apps and I have to say it has it‚Äôs ups and downs. 
Pros: You can expect calls to work perfectly as long as you both have good internet connections. Even when you internet slows down you can still see each other but the quality drops so you can load the video. As someone who‚Äôs used Skype for years I‚Äôve noticed on newer phones that selecting things actually works unlike on slower phones where its stutters and takes time. 
Cons: They‚Äôre pushing too much with emojis and filters and stuff. Why do I have an option to take a picture in the middle of a Skype call? I can literally just turn on my camera and show the person. I have to press speaker all the time when I first make a call and I‚Äôm constantly pressing the camera button and waiting forever just to close it. After a call I‚Äôm literally asked every time how the quality was. Stop shoving things in my face please. I just wanna call, not see every ‚Äúgreat feature you have‚Äù. Personally I don‚Äôt use 90% of the things Skype has to offer. I just call and turn on my camera. I wish it would focus on that and keep it simple. I don‚Äôt wanna have a 1/8 of my screen covered by something I don‚Äôt use. 

Please just make calling easier, it‚Äôs starting to make me think I should switch to Discord."	positive
351	304878510	social	4	"I‚Äôve been using Skype for more than 11 years now, through its ups and downs. Just finally installed the most recent version on my iPhone X, so haven‚Äôt used it for a few months now. This version is more stable, and higher quality than I‚Äôve seen from Skype for a while. When we first started using it, talking back and forth between Japan and the United States in 2008, it was the only game in town and it was great to have! 
Over the years though, especially shortly after Microsoft took it over, it got really glitchy and frustrating to use. Now, using it for a half hour video call to Russia, I have basically no problems with it. Sound quality, video quality, ease-of-use, all basically very good.
My one issue, and the reason I only give it four stars instead of five, is that the screen sharing isn‚Äôt working as expected. Looks like the functionality should be there, but simply hitting the share screen button took me to a dialog box which asked about which app I would like to record. Record? I tried that, but all I did was, well, record. Looks like maybe there‚Äôs just some sort of disconnect, perhaps easy to fix, in the software. 
Overall, very nice to see that Skype is once again a viable option!"	positive
352	304878510	social	3	"i‚Äôve used skype on and off for a few years. i think of skype as ‚Äúthat video call app‚Äù because originally it was just to call people as either a video call, audio call, and ‚Äúchat‚Äù(because nobody really uses it) app. i feel like with all these new updates skype is using up valuable space both on said persons phone which instead they could be using on improving the quality of the apps features. not making new features and icons and lists and tips that nobody is going to use. 
second, regarding (video)calls, whenever i call someone skype has a tendency to randomly turn off and the screen goes completely black. this only happens when i use skype. i would like this to be fixed because it‚Äôs really bothersome and pisses me off all the time. on that note whenever i (video)call someone i always(and i mean ALWAYS)have to turn on the video or sometimes both the video and speaker even though it‚Äôs a video call and should automatically do that because it‚Äôs a video call. 
anyways i think originally this was a great app because it was so simple and easy to use, but now there is so much going on the real point isn‚Äôt there anymore and is constantly being altered. please fix the glitches i addresses in this and thanks."	positive
353	304878510	social	3	"This is why we use the app ‚Äî to make video calls or phone calls to loved ones. Connections are inconsistent, depending upon where one or both parties are situated in their respective locations. With cellular coverage and WiFi (most times, combined) this shouldn‚Äôt even be an issue. There should never be dropped calls nor lagging connections. 

I don‚Äôt want to constantly scroll through screens; asking for money, taking 10 random pictures of the app screen nor use emoticons while I‚Äôm talking with my loved one. Please remove those options or at the very least, make it difficult/impossible to do so while simply talking to the other person. Not everyone wants to use video or speakerphone all the time; some of us prefer the old fashioned way of talking to someone on the phone. It‚Äôs inconvenient to have to stop mid-conversation all the time to see what my ear is up to, seeing what random page I‚Äôm scrolling through unintentionally.

These are things we care about; connecting with those we love. Focus on those things; the quality of this particular aspect - the central aspect - of your service. Cool that other things are offered but please make those secondary things inactive while we‚Äôre on a call."	positive
354	304878510	social	3	Definitely an overall good calling app. I‚Äôve used things like FaceTime and Snapchat to make video calls before, but they just don‚Äôt work as well. Skype usually seems to load no matter what, unless the connection is extremely poor which isn‚Äôt the fault of Skype. One of the main drawbacks is all the buttons littering the screen. Like many other reviewers have stated, things are a bit over crowded, especially for a phone app. My screen is small enough as it is and I want to see the person I‚Äôm talking to. That‚Äôs the point of the video call. My biggest gripe here is the poor internet connection notification box. Can we please move the poor internet connection notification box? It pops up right in the center of the screen! Thanks for telling me I have a poor connection, but I don‚Äôt understand why something can‚Äôt pop up in the corner. This notification blocks my whole entire screen so I can‚Äôt see who I‚Äôm talking to. This just makes me want to use an app that doesn‚Äôt tell me about the strength of my internet connection (because I don‚Äôt care about that information anyways). It would definitely be a five star app if these few problems could get addressed.	positive
355	304878510	social	4	I live in a rural area where my cell phone mostly does not work, and the small local phone company here has expensive rates for unlimited long distance ‚Äî even if I call the next town over. I use Skype (I have a Skype phone number), ooma, or WhatsApp, to telecommute and call out of my limited area. Skype is better than ooma because the quality is usually good and I can reliably make outgoing calls or connect to meetings such as via zoom or gotomeeting. Sometimes my internet connection strength seems to fluctuate though, and my Skype calls break up or echo and distort. My biggest criticism is that people I call may see a long 01 number with no name and without my correct location in their caller ID. Sometimes they do see my correct information but mostly not. With the current deluge of robo calls, this means often recipients are cautious about answering my calls. Overall as a telecommuter, I am happy to have Skype ... without it, connecting for meetings and doing business would be a lot more difficult and expensive.	positive
356	304878510	social	4	"1) My experience with Skype over the last six years has been very good on both my laptop and my iPhone. I mostly use Skype for calling telephone numbers. Indeed, I have listened to lectures by dialing a phone number and experiencing excellent connections for hours at time. 
2) With this app on my iPhone, the volume and clarity are particularly good with 50-mps wifi on my end. 
3) Some other times, the volume of the other person has been a bit low, but I was still able to understand what the other person was saying. 
4) The only funky thing that I have found with the app was when I wanted to add a secondary email address to my account. I read help first, but it seemed to be out of date since the navigation information in the help text didn‚Äôt correspond very well with the app. Eventually, I deduced that I couldn‚Äôt use the app to update my email addresses. I had to chat with support and login in to the Skype website to make the modifications. Most apps allow you to change email addresses within the apps."	positive
357	304878510	social	4	I‚Äôve used Skype for 2-3 years now and it wasn‚Äôt really that bad. I used it everyday to call and text my friends. But there‚Äôs a slight problem. There are always these suggestions I can use if I send a message or someone sends me a message. I press the button that these aren‚Äôt useful, but they keep coming back! I dislike the suggestions because I accidentally keep pressing it and it immediately sends and makes my friend confused. Also, whenever I call someone, it won‚Äôt even let me turn off my phone! It is so annoying because when I turn off my phone so save battery while calling, it immediately hangs up. Whenever I call on the computer and go on another tab at the same time (like playing a game), it affects my game. It freezes my game all the time. Also, my Skype just crashes when I call on the computer. It immediately closes the tab and hangs up. It gets me and my friend really irritated. I love this app but it just has a few problems that needs to be fixed	positive
358	304878510	social	3	"My biggest complaint is that anyone in the chat can do whatever they want with it. One person can start a group, and another person can change the name, picture, group members, etc. Which means anyone who wants to be annoying can just remove people for ‚Äúa joke‚Äù or whatever. Anyone can kick you from the call or the group, no matter who that person is, or whether they‚Äôre toxic or not. I tolerate them because they‚Äôre not all bad, but then they pull something where they try to remake the group, and remove anyone who disagrees. Only the one who made the group should be able to remove people from the call/group, and edit it in any way.
I know that isn‚Äôt the app‚Äôs fault, it‚Äôs the person‚Äôs, and that the typical advice is ‚Äújust don‚Äôt interact with that person‚Äù but in this situation that‚Äôs not possible. It‚Äôs a group where everyone is at. The entire ‚Äúfriend group‚Äù. While a new group can be made, there‚Äôs nothing stopping the same thing from happening again/continuously. Please add a function where only the group maker can screw with the settings, thank you."	negative
359	304878510	social	4	Alright so I use Skype all the time and I love it because it has such a good quality of sound and it‚Äôs significantly better than the normal phone call. I love that it‚Äôs fairly easy to use and that you can change the colors of your background to match your personality behaves who doesn‚Äôt want to express themselves?!?! Anyways, I literally love this app but there‚Äôs only one problem. Why don‚Äôt I get any notifications while I‚Äôm on a call??? I‚Äôve missed some very important messages and I‚Äôve almost been grounded on many occasions due to the fact that I‚Äôm not getting the notifications while I‚Äôm in a call. And what‚Äôs even worse is that my boyfriend has been using Skype for WAAAYYYYY longer than I have and he‚Äôs had this problem the entire time he‚Äôs been using it but just never said anything about it. Alongside of myself, all of my friends have the same problem and was wondering if that minor problem could possibly be fixed because it would life a lot easier. Thank you very much.	positive
360	304878510	social	5	I have been on Skype since 2002. For sixteen years, this has been my favorite app as it has kept up with the improvements in technology. Over the past years, I have been on international trips and Skype has kept me connected to my family and relatives in 3 different countries. The quality of calls has improved a lot over the years, too - sparing me from huge amounts of phone bills. However, I believe that the key is to have a decent internet connection. I am really impressed that is now being used widely both for personal and business communications. I have had lots of job interviews through call conferences. Love the emojis as they also keep up with the times, i.e., diversity. I can actually choose the color of the skin of the clapping hands or see different options on couples. I can go on for the many ways Skype has been an essential part of my life through the years - forever loyal to you! Thanks, Skype üëèüèºüôåüèº üçæ.	positive
361	304878510	social	3	"Been a good choice for the many years I‚Äôve used Skype to talk with friends and for business call. Clear connection sound, versatile chat, group calls, group chats, etc. do recommend for people needing any type of free voice app or for group calls. But I‚Äôm always having problems with Skype. Everytime I update it, it creates a new problem that disables it from being reliable. Maybe it gets fixed or not but seems best for me to never update it. I once waited for maybe 10 updates or so and never had any problems. Then finally updated it because I got a new phone. Ever since updating has only caused me more problems. Maybe not the case for everyone but I wish I never updated from the obviously stable version I had. 
Faced with connection issues, failed calls, dropped calls, no ringer when called, screen overlay not disabling, multiple call glitches where I‚Äôll be in a call and it will pop up asking me to hang up and accept the same call I‚Äôm already in. Many problems but over all a good app that I would recommend."	positive
362	304878510	social	1	"My boyfriend and I are long distance and for over a year now we have used Skype to call every day. Skype used to be perfect and we had no issues in call. Sometimes there would be quality drops in the video but that was just due to internet connection. We could also hear the background noise and it was very loud and amplified it was hard to call with that. 
Now when we call for the past 3 months or so after a major update skype has never worked. This app has become so horrible for us. One of our ends will go mute and the audio won‚Äôt work during some calls and I can‚Äôt even switch my camera anymore or go out of the app because my side of the video will go black. He can still see me but I can‚Äôt see myself and other times his video will go off if I go into our chats and come back. Background noise is still a huge issue and is just as bad as it was a year ago.
 I have become so frustrated with this app due to its recent behavior and I‚Äôve tried to put up with it but it bothers me so much. It has made our calls so unpleasant and I am highly dissatisfied and we will both be moving to discord to call from now on."	negative
363	304878510	social	4	Skype is a very useful and helpful service for international calling. Confusing interface.  When you click the iPhone button to tune your screen off, the Skype call terminates.  This means, unlike a regular phone call on iPhone where I turn the screen off, continue my conversation, and put the phone in my pocket with headphones all the time, the Skype app will automatically hang up on whomever I‚Äôm talking to.  This is especially obnoxious with international customer service phone calls where I had to wait 30 minutes in a phone queue, and then accidentally hung up on the customer service rep I was talking to.  They can‚Äôt call me back of course because Skype generates those electronic web phone numbers, which are not associated with anyone‚Äôs device, and so I‚Äôm screwed.  Please change this feature, Skype!  Make the app continue the phone call when an iPhone user clicks the power button to sleep their screen.	negative
364	304878510	social	3	I did not wish to criticize what was the very first ever communication system that I discovered saved me loads of money and had a voice quality better than my fixed line calls. It was also very simple to use. You open the app you click on contacts you click on the name of the person you want to call, video or not, and you hear that most unique calling sound and the contact answers and you do your thing. That‚Äôs how simple it was and it became a system to shout about. Somebody tried to fix perfection and now it has so many fixes that it has become imperfect. A step downwards. Now I am one million present sure that it is not the intention of the programmers or any Skype staff or member to see this downward motion in the eyes of so many of its faith clients. So my long time friends at Skype do some more listening to the many reviews that so many people already took much of their time and energy to write. Keep it simple, easy to use by the nerds and my grandparents.	positive
365	304878510	social	1	"I‚Äôve used Skype for a long time, ever since MSN was bought by Microsoft and I‚Äôve had the app for as long as I‚Äôve had a smartphone. Skype app has always been buggy. You‚Äôd expect seamless connections across all platforms but that has not always been the case and it gets infuriating when I‚Äôm trying to have a conversation with someone but they can‚Äôt hear me, etc. As these problems are solved, new ones arise. I get it, you can‚Äôt have a perfect app, so I continue to deal as I mainly use this to communicate in my LDR. 

However, with the latest updates for iPhone and for Skype, the horrible integrated calling feature is now NOT optional. You can‚Äôt turn it off and calls are routed through the iPhone calling system. This disables me from using my other apps if I‚Äôm in a non-WiFi area. Additionally, when I hang up my Skype calls through the iPhone calling screen, it causes the entire iPhone to freeze and I can‚Äôt do anything until it corrects itself by restarting. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Bring back the option to turn off integrated calling please. For reference, I have the iPhone 8."	negative
366	304878510	social	4	I‚Äôve been using Skype for years, mainly because it‚Äôs better than FaceTime and Snapchat when it comes to just calling, but for the love of god, please stop showing me the would you like to respond or whatever it‚Äôs called when my call doesn‚Äôt go through or the someone I‚Äôm trying to call doesn‚Äôt pick up or whatever the case may be. If I‚Äôm going to respond I‚Äôll just do it in the chat, I don‚Äôt need you to pull up some auto response of ‚Äúplease give me a call back.‚Äù Or whatever it says, the reason I‚Äôm writing this is mainly due to the fact of this feature deleting the text I had there with the ‚Äúplease give me a call back,‚Äù text. I spent a good 30-45 minutes writing a message to my girlfriend just to have it disappear. It‚Äôs a bad feature, and I hope to see it be removed or at least give us the option to turn it off.

367	304878510	social	5	I would definitely recommend Skype to my friends and family and I already have some on the platform! I know you love to make money and all, but I think you should remove paying to call on mobile. I think it‚Äôs just stupid. But you can make groups and call with the groups, I honestly love it. The reason I‚Äôm writing this and taking time out of my day, That‚Äôs how much I love Skype! I get to share photos and I also found family members in the You may know section! If you haven‚Äôt downloaded Skype your wasting your time. (Well doing it kinda wastes your time but in a good way!) I really love Skype and the creators, thank you for all of your hard work on this application/App. I would write more but I‚Äôm out of ideas to talk about and I think this review is really long, again thank you for reading this, and all your hard work Skype.

368	304878510	social	1	"I‚Äôve been using this app for years and despite numerous issues with this app, the new and current frustration that‚Äôs so irritating I must leave a review about it is the forced integrated calling. I do not want skype calls in my iphone 7‚Äôs phone log. I am beyond angered that if I so much as shut my screen off, the call hangs up because it‚Äôs functioning like a phone call rather than a skype call. I hate that it makes two apps open: the skype app and the phone app. Both are simultaneously running because of the integrated calling. And both act as separate apps! I can mute a call on the skype app, yet it‚Äôs unmuted on the phone app. I can take a call off speaker in one app, but it‚Äôs on speaker in the other???

PLEASE get rid of the forced integrated calling. Please do not force it onto your users. Leave it as an option as it used to be. I‚Äôm looking at other options than Skype since it‚Äôs rendering useless to me if the calls are integrated with my regular phone calls and are constantly getting hung up because of function mix ups. Fix this."	negative
369	304878510	social	1	"Skype was pretty good before they had all of these updates. If you have a tech guy who knows how to fix bugs and the problems I shouldn‚Äôt have to write a nasty review about this problem. Sometimes I can‚Äôt see on the video call the other people when I try to call them or when someone calls me I can‚Äôt come back to see them. It‚Äôs only the picture and a color for the background. This shouldn‚Äôt have happen when Skype tries to update their app every 2 to 4 weeks to monthly. This is should be fixed in the first time when people complain about it. Today I had a call and the app was bad. I couldn‚Äôt see the video call. It was the picture and a color background. Also I couldn‚Äôt see the video when the other person answered the call. Fix the bugs and problem. 

Skype was good until the updates and bugs. I can‚Äôt make a copy a link and paste my link on Skype message because the screen would turn into a color background. Why do you guys do updates when you have failed since the last one"	negative
370	304878510	social	2	Unless someone refuses to use, or doesn‚Äôt have, Skype then this is basically my sole app for calling anyone. I really do want to like this app more, but for mobile there is, at least in my case, one MAJOR drawback. The notifications are broken. It‚Äôs not that they never work (because then it would likely be a case of them simply being off). For other apps with messaging typically each new message prompts a notification, but with Skype it seems I only get one notification for the first message and then no new notifications from that person until I check the messages. Also, there have been many instances where I get a banner notification but no red icon on the app. So for example if the message came while I was sleeping but gets pushed down by a host of other notifications, when I open my phone and just look for the red icons I don‚Äôt see one for Skype and assume I received no messages there. Thus Skype only becomes useful for calling. I hope this can be improved.	positive
371	304878510	social	1	In iPhone app Skype ‚ÄúUnlimited Worldwide mobiles and landline‚Äù has no information about big limitations and exclusions of this plan, no link to more information about this plan. When you see the name you obviously think that it‚Äôs a good deal and when you click on the plan you right away invited to the purchase of this plan. But when you try you to use it you‚Äôll find out that this particular phone line in this particular country is not covered by this plan. You contact Skype support to complain about this misinformation and they will tell you contact Apple because your transaction was through the iTunes account. Apple will send you back to developer to chase your refund. At the end, shame on you Microsoft for giving false information to the customers and putting them through all these trails to get the refund! Why can‚Äôt you be honest upfront about these subscriptions and tell customers that your ‚ÄúUnlimited Worldwide‚Äú subscription is in fact is very limited and absolutely not worldwide?	negative
372	304878510	social	1	The Skype app for iPhone has gone from not so user friendly as the classic fast simple app which we all loved to right out useless. Attempting to create a new Skype account using the app sends to some blank Microsoft screens and frozen message screens. Specifically the iPhone X. The product has been undergoing some champagnes since the acquisition by Microsoft but on the user side these have manifested as consistent poor results: confusing screens and services, missing or hard to manage features, and now just plain not functional. I‚Äôm forced to migrate video calls to FaceTime or WhatsApp or Viber. For a respectable tech company, this is a failure on the backend integration, front end design, and services side. While it was working, the only thing I think remained fairly decent was the video quality. But so is the quality of all the other apps! Microsoft, get that team‚Äôs act together and rebuild the app to be simple and functional so the majority of users do not depart to all the other mean and functional alternatives!	negative
373	304878510	social	4	"Look I love this app for the phone, and for the computer and well all platforms. Although, I must admit the quality on some devices is not as good as others. So for instance, I talk to many people in other countries and sometimes their computers are better to hear and see them from while other times their phones. 
What my point is, although I move the good graphics and interaction that this is capable of. You should try increasing the audio (make more clear) and cross platform capabilities. This is just my request, thank you for your time. Also yes I know audio is more of a device issue than a programming thus difficult to fix, although the cross platform issue may be slightly difficult but worth it. Thank you again for your time and sorry for pointing out the difficult parts, please just try not to take it to personally."	positive
374	304878510	social	5	"There are a lot of things going on around Skype. Some people say that they prefer old interface. Other‚Äôs remember old bugs. But reality is way better. Most of the old bugs are squashed. Skype actually works better than before these days. New looks... why they supposed to keep old interface for ages? Kid is a changing. New changes may not be to everyone‚Äôs taste, but they are not that bad if you give them a chance. Dark mode, reactions and stuff - they make Skype look modern and up to date. 
The only element for me that still struggles with intuitive use is ‚Äòedit‚Äô. There‚Äôs a message in chat screen and there‚Äôs an edited version of it below. It does not make sense. If you edit something that is history - let it ‚Äòlive‚Äô in history. 
Otherwise this new Skype is very good!"	positive
375	304878510	social	4	As someone in a long distance relationship, I depend heavily on video calling. Quality of Skype calls are pretty good and I like the ability to use Skype on any device. That being said, my boyfriend is Deaf and we use ASL to communicate. I don‚Äôt need the notifications saying ‚Äúpeople are having trouble hearing you. Try moving closer to the microphone or eliminate background noise.‚Äù I understand that I‚Äôm getting this because it‚Äôs not picking up sound from my end, but I can promise doing those things won‚Äôt help so I‚Äôd appreciate not getting constant reminders. I‚Äôve also been recently struggling with the little box that‚Äôs supposed to show me just shows black. The other person can see me fine, but I can‚Äôt see myself. This makes it very difficult to make sure I‚Äôm always on screen and able to be seen.	positive

This app has everything we need: a call session with the option to turn on the camera, ability to send pictures and chat, and the ability to quote chat bubbles to make fun of each other‚Äôs typos! 
 
However, there are a few issues that really annoy my friend and I. For one, sometimes notifications won‚Äôt send! I hope anyone can see why this is super infuriating (and really, it was so infuriating that it‚Äôs the reason why I‚Äôm writing this review). Second, the emojis are too much. I really dislike them and wish there was a proper way to completely shut them off. Third of all, while this might be a nit pick, a lot of the features are a bit too much. There‚Äôs a lot of things in this app that are nice and all.. but is it really necessary? Like emojis, bots, etc. 

Overall, I like this app, but there are a few things I want fixed.

(Also, my friend noticed that this app would sometimes lag, freeze, and crash? I‚Äôve experienced this too, and if it‚Äôs the app‚Äôs issue, then please fix this. If this is an issue with having many things loaded on our devices, then ignore this)"	positive
377	304878510	social	1	I don‚Äôt know what Microsoft is thinking but the current Skype app on iOS is the most useless one ever. It is an extremely difficult task finding a number on your contact list and using Skype to call that number. First, no matter how hard you try, your iPhone contacts simply don‚Äôt show on Skype, giving Skype access to your contacts doesn‚Äôt change this. If this is a phone calling app amongst other things, shouldn‚Äôt this be a basic feature? Secondly, even if you copy a number and paste in the dial pad, it automatically deletes the ‚Äú+‚Äù sign (if you have saved contacts in international format). There is no way to edit the pasted number from dial pad to add the plus sign back so you always have to manually write down a number to call it using Skype!!! Please Microsoft, test your own products for ease of use. This is the most annoying Skype app ever. If people are buying Skype credit, is because they want to use the phone features; make it usable. PLEASE!	positive
378	304878510	social	1	"I used skype almost 13 years. Last couple of years it started to be very difficult to use. When you open a new account it wants your microsoft account if you don‚Äôt have a microsoft account you can not open an account. Also now Skype wants all of your phone contacts to sync with your skype account which is not necessary. I do not want all my contacts in my skype account anyways. It was really easy to use before but now it is not easy. When you want to close your account they are not closing it immediately!! I have to wait 60 days???!!
Really?? For what reason?? Why!?? What happens to my contacts there in 60 days? 
I really am tired from the internet world long time ago because we have no privacy anymore but skype was the last thing that I trusted but not anymore.

379	304878510	social	1	This is probably the only social app that actually ruins relationships instead of bringing people closer like it was originally designed to. Why is there no way to turn off showing my status and when I am online? All other apps got away with that by now. Choosing to stay ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô just doesn‚Äôt work and the app automatically shows me online at random times, like when it‚Äôs 4am in the morning for me and I am sleeping! And my contacts from other parts of the world think I am online and start calling me and then it looks like I am ignoring their calls. And when I am on a call, it also shows me as online and other people start calling and then think I am just ignoring them. I am tired of apologizing for nothing. The only solution I found is to sign out all the time but then I miss the messages I get. It just doesn‚Äôt have to be this complicated. I really wish I didn‚Äôt have to use it but some of my older contacts still use it so I‚Äôll wait it out.	positive

But when I recently got a new laptop, it came with my Microsoft ID/email address filled in, not my Skype ID‚Äîwhich I didn‚Äôt catch right away.  So I wondered where my subscription, number, credit, and contacts had disappeared to!?!  That was sneaky of Microsoft to automatically fill in my Microsoft ID, when my Skype ID had everything tied to it.  A friend had the same issue, but realized too late that he ended up with two Skype accounts and added credit and a subscription renewal to the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù ID.

381	304878510	social	3	Long time user of Skype here. As stated already, the UI is horribly unintuitive and difficult to navigate. Nothing about it is organized properly. But aside from all of that, the one major feature that annoys the absolute hell out of me is the fact that the power button sometimes ends the call. I‚Äôm left unable to turn off my phone‚Äôs screen unless I wait for it to time out on it‚Äôs own. Even if I‚Äôm in a completely different app, it STILL causes Skype calls to end when I push the power button. It simply should not do this, I‚Äôm more than capable of choosing one of the more conventional methods of ending calls, such as the ‚Äúend call‚Äù button on screen. The other thing is, it DOESN‚ÄôT always do this. Sometimes it simply turns of my phone‚Äôs screen as it should. It makes no sense. This is very frustrating, please consider revising this.	negative

In just this last year, I have met some great people who have become great friends ~ but some live in Europe. There is no way I‚Äôm upgrading my cell phone to make calls to Europe $$$ LOL  One close friend talked me into using the Skype audio-only chat, and it‚Äôs FANTASTIC! We can talk almost any time we wish, all for free! And I can reconnect with my friends in Canada, as well. 

I can‚Äôt say that it is 100% reliable; I have one or two calls a week that just don‚Äôt work (one end can‚Äôt hear the other), but it‚Äôs maybe 1 out of 10 calls that have that problem. It‚Äôs usually remedied by hanging up & starting a new call. That really quite amazing for free calls to Europe!

My partner and I have recently switched to Discord. Not only can we text, voice call, and video call; but we have organized our own server with different channels to discuss/post our schedules and videos/photos of vacations we have taken together.

The purchase goes through but credit might not show up forever. Trying to make a call, singing out and in , all the things that google suggest - nothing works. It used to be instant. 
Quality of calls and skyoe video chats went down as well. UX is so bad that it feels that the designers were pursuing the goal to irritate you . The ux used to be much better.

Most times it works well and because I use it from my internet enabled cell phone to a land line, the prices are way much cheaper than any cell phone service around the world! One thing I really do not understand is the ringing when you are placing a call: sometimes it rings like a phone and sometimes it has a music ring and it is hard to understand if the system made or not the connection as sometimes the call goes through and other it does not!

If I go to redial, it reverses the order of these on the drop down menu so you must be extra careful that you don‚Äôt hit the wrong button to pay to get more credit if you don‚Äôt need it then.  I wish it was the same each time- please make it simple.  It‚Äôs annoying!!!  Other than that issue , I find it to work fine and quality of the calls via the land lines or video is usually good.

Not to mention being able to call my grandma and one friend who is still determined to own a flip phone. I have only used it maybe a dozen times but it saved me being able to make those calls. So far so good. Not to mention half of the U.S. stuff like credit cards require a phone number for online access. I can at least give them my Skype number as for some reason they haven‚Äôt figured out how to allow international numbers.	positive
391	304878510	social	2	"First of all the app is very easy to use, and most of the time the voice is loud and clear. Other than that, I'm facing lots of troubles with it. First, if you're searching for a contact in your address book you would find lots of other Skype contacts, you didn't even hear about, and then after a couple of seconds you might find the one you're looking for among them, or you might fail from the first time and you have to do it again.
And then about 3 months ago, on ""each"" Skype to land line call, I can't hear anything from the other side after 3 minutes of the call, and when I end the call and make it again the other side tells me that he could hear me, but I couldn't hear him. This is happening constantly in ""all"" the calls I'm making. Knowing that the app is always updated and my phone software is always updated."	negative
392	304878510	social	4	Used Skype for more than 15 years, and was getting better and better, until recently there is a problem when trying to turn in Speaker after receiving a call. Then new user interface has a time delay when in a call so one must touch screen and then the speaker icon quickly appears but does not allow to be pressed! It sometimes needs to be pressed more than 10 times to be activated and this can take a few minutes of waiting for you and the person calling. This problem does not exist on any other apps. I hope Skype fixes this, if they do I will write another review because I like many things about Skype, especially the black theme and user ID instead of phone number login.	positive
393	304878510	social	1	"The service of Skype is great, however the iPhone app is awful.

It‚Äôs as if Microsoft didn‚Äôt even try. A first time developer could make a better app, there is no excuse for this from a billion dollar company.

Everything, and I mean everything, is slow. 

Trying to search contacts or the call history is slower than the first PC. It‚Äôs actually faster to go to my iPhone contacts copy a phone number and then paste it in Skype instead of searching for a contact. Even finding someone in your recent call history takes forever.

The app is also extremely buggy. Sometimes it shows the call connected, but either person can hear anything. Try using Bluetooth earphones/mic and the problem happens regularly.

Also, navigating this app is horrible. Did anyone at Microsoft think this through at all? The nightmare which is ‚Äúchats‚Äù needs to go.

Microsoft for such a great service (Skype) you somehow managed to find a way to ruin it with this app, especially on the iPhone.
With WhatsApp and FaceTime being so easy to use, why would you release such garbage?

Please start over, and create an app that actually functions properly, with normal speed, and a simple interface.

Long time Microsoft fan here doing a major face smack and head shake because of this app. Come on, get it together already."	positive
394	304878510	social	2	Yes, I can make a call, yes I have a Skype number, but the single feature that made Skype worth it for me was ‚ÄòAuto Answer‚Äô. You could have Skype auto answer, and decide who it would auto answer to. This allowed me to connect with home, video or audio, without the need for someone to answer. A very useful feature. Now Skype is a big ho him, voip, ok, just another phone thing. I‚Äôm not sure I have a compelling use for it anymore. I hope they reconsider a very bad decision, and stop giving us less features. It was a wonderful, useful program, now ..... not so much. If I keep it, I‚Äôll go back to the free stuff. No point in paying for fair to mediocre. Did I mention the new interface makes little or no sense? I wonder who was able to come up with so many poor concepts, and produce something so inferior to the original version. And why?	positive
395	304878510	social	5	Voice call with recipient in Jos, Plateau State, Nigeria. Due to broadband limitations on the receiving end this call was quickly switched from video to voice only, although it began in video mode successfully. In this mode it went forward with a clear connection and with essentially no delay. It‚Äôd be hard to classify quality as anything but excellent. I‚Äôd prefer to be able to route the conversation through the speaker function on this iPhone 8, and still have the use of my Bluetooth connected hearing aids, which may be as simple as disabling Bluetooth prior to initiating the call. This would allow others on my side to hear the  responses from the called end.	positive
396	304878510	social	2	"*Old issues* (unfixed, and will never be fixed, nobody likes it this way... but we got used to it)
Every complaint people have been making about the ""new Skype"" changed being over complicated and lacking useful features it used to have I completely agree with, in fact I'm sure you've heard of many times.... however it's been almost half a year now since the changes happened, and a large majority of these problems haven't been fixed, and I know they won't be. A problem that I will say that might be fixed is that when I create a poll using Skype a built in pole features, I seem to be the only one who can use it, and only in the chat it was created in. Seriously though, Microsoft has slowly been making Skype worse and worse ever since they bought it."	positive
397	304878510	social	2	OMG. this is so frustrating at this point. skype was such a comfortable app that I have been using on desktop and phone. Desktop is fine, but suddenly on mobile (maybe 2 months ago), every time I switch apps after having turned my camera on during call, the camera will come on temporarily when I come back to the app and shut off after about 8seconds. The only solution is ending the call and starting again. This is so inconvenient and if the other party is sleeping or away from the phone they can‚Äôt even pick up the call. I wish this problem would be fixed. I wish all of these apps would realize when they‚Äôre ahead and just stop changing everything. Skype is plenty comfortable the way it is, and with every update it‚Äôs becoming less and less convenient. Please fix this problem.	positive
398	304878510	social	1	Unfortunately, due to discord becoming incredibly better than Skype these last few months, the problem isn't the the GUI, and, settings change and the new layout, even though this is stupid and it should revert back to its normal state, the problem is Discord is just doing everything you do, but better. They don't change their layout drastically and whenever they make a pathetic update, they revert back because the community asked. They also own up to their mistakes. If you truly want to become a successful business again, revert to the original easy to use, not limited layout. And also... try to do BETTER than Discord. I know none of this will be listened to. But for anyone reading this. This would save Skype from becoming irrelevant and would at least keep some users from switching to the better service.	positive
399	304878510	social	5	"This version of Skype has performed very very reliably for me for my needs, which include international collaborations and making travel arrangements in distant countries.  
     I personally find the current user interface to lack some of the design clarity of the original versions.  I have trouble finding out where to click to get desired contact info, and find myself staring to locate the dial pad at times ‚Äî all those things used to be large and evident, and now the screen seems dominated by graphic schemed art instead of the rudimentary functions that one uses the MOST.   Need better usage-priority oriented design and layout."	positive
400	1096918571	social	5	Downloaded this app because I have ZERO cell service in my house and apple didn‚Äôt enable WiFi calling. So instead of stepping outside in the rain or freezing weather whenever someone wanted to call me at home, Duo has solved that. Call audio is the clearest I have ever heard on a phone call, like the person is on the other side of your phone talking at your ear. I have strong WiFi so I can‚Äôt say how it would perform if WiFi is spotty. I noticed that when you are not on WiFi and take a duo call over your cell service there is a bit of a delay between accepting the call and when the caller can hear you which can lead to some confusion, but still great call quality. Very simple interface, no bells and whistles, just works, and works great.	positive
401	1096918571	social	5	My mom is Deaf and so we have used Duo to communicate when we are not at home together, especially since I have an iPhone and she has a Samsung. In my family, we have used many video chatting apps but none have worked as great or smoothly as Duo, especially since there is the option to leave a video message! One feature that I wish the app had is to mute the other person‚Äî sometimes when I am on a call with my mom, I am in a public place, such as at a grocery store or salon, and I have to ask my mom to mute herself on the phone since lowering the volume and turning the ringer off from my phone does not actually turn the volume off. Other than that, Duo is really good for video calls!	positive
402	1096918571	social	5	This is a great app and all, and I love it, but I was on it with my friend for about 5 minutes, and my battery totally almost died. Before I started this call I was at about 50%, but I had to end it because my phone was at 1%. I told my friend about it though, and she said her battery wasn‚Äôt dying at all. It may just be the phone company though because she has a Samsung and I have an Apple. Trick for Apple users: if you power your phone off, wait ten seconds, and then power it back on, it gains a lot of battery. I like now that you can do group chats. That‚Äôs a cool new feature that was just added. Also, I can Google Duo my friends that have Samsung‚Äôs. I love that you can send videos and I just love it!!	positive
403	1096918571	social	5	I this is amazing there‚Äôs just like two things. First can you make it so you could see when your video messages are read because I want to know if my friends read it or I have to call them and tell them, Second and you make it so that if you want to remove someone from your group chat that you made you could because I by mistake put some people in the group chat that I don‚Äôt want. And the last thing can you please make the app so that you don‚Äôt have to use it with internet because sometimes I want to talk to my friends and I have no internet so I have to wait till I get home to call them and see there video messages so can you please please fix it!	positive
404	1096918571	social	5	The internet and cell service at my apartment is spotty at best, and my long-distance boyfriend and I had been continuously frustrated by this as it was difficult for us to skype, FaceTime, or Facebook messenger video call, and actually hold a conversation and be able to see each other, and even regular voice calls would drop or be noisy. Duo somehow has absolutely none of the problems of the other services, and my boyfriend and I are so happy that we can finally hold a conversation like we‚Äôre right next to each other instead of nearly 1000 miles apart. Since downloading the app, we haven‚Äôt bothered using anything else.	positive
405	1096918571	social	4	"... has been a total game changer for me and my family. I have a lot of family that live in various states that I connect with on a regular basis. I love talking to my family but getting to see them is so much better. If I work late I can just call my husband and have a quick peek at my sleeping angel. The ONLY problem i have with it is, is that at times the connection can get a bit blurry depending on what kind of phone they have, phone service, WiFi connection, etc....
But overall love the app. Highly recommend to all who have loved ones who live far and way and would like to keep in touch and the best part is, you don‚Äôt need to buy on of the expensive iPhones just to what they call ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù lol."	positive
406	1096918571	social	5	"You know when they show video chats in movies and it's so clear, it's as if they're editing live? This video was super clear like that. 

I like the Facebook messenger app video chat over FaceTime and Skype (anything is better than skype), but this Duo app is above all of that and way better than the hangouts iOS app. 

I have an iPhone 6s with 10.3.3 software. It worked so incredible for my call with my sister. The app downloaded in only a few seconds, so it's super lean and doesn't take up much storage space. My phone is getting old, so the battery drains quickly with video; but that's a phone issue. Highly recommend this app."	positive
407	1096918571	social	5	Google duo is AMAZING. I have so many friends who cannot FaceTime because they don‚Äôt have iPhones and I can‚Äôt contact them on social media because that‚Äôs just not my thing. But anyways google duo has great quality, my calls always end up coming in great. And unlike other apps I‚Äôve tried I actually get notifications on google duo. Google duo is just amazing for me and couldn‚Äôt get any better. One thing to make it even better is adding some fun effects to do while your on video chat. But other than that little suggestion nothing about google duo should be changed, this app is my phone call heaven üòá	positive
408	1096918571	social	5	As a person with an Iphone that has a lot of friends and family with androids, this app is wonderful. The quality of the videos are really good, and so is the audio. It takes your feedback on problems with the calls, which i‚Äôm really grateful for. Google Duo saves a lot of time, too. You can send voice measages between Iphones and androids, and video messages are available too. Overall, it‚Äôs a great, fun, and reliable app. The only tiny thing I would change is the abilities during calls. If you turn off the phone, the call will end. Other than that, this app has been a really helpful part of my phone.	positive
409	1096918571	social	1	"I installed the Google Duo Video app to talk to my parents who don‚Äôt have FaceTime. They mentioned they had both installed it because they wanted to video chat with me and my daughter.  
During the 3 months this app was on my phone I received about 20+ spam calls PER DAY.  Sometimes less than 1 minute apart.  I would block the numbers, but a new number would just show up a minute later.  The same thing was happening to both of my parents.  Once I uninstalled the Google Duo Video App, the spam calls completely stopped.  My parents also uninstalled it and their spam calls stopped as well.  This is the worst app I have ever put on my phone for that reason.  This is completely unacceptable.  I do not have this issue with FaceTime.  I 100% do not recommend the app to anyone who says they are considering.  There‚Äôs a huge privacy issue with this app."	negative

It was very simple to download using an IPhone XR, my contacts synced  for easy access, and the effects and filters worked great to add a bit of fun to you videos. I like the way you can send video or voice messages, I don't like the fact that you can not block the screen when calling someone. It's almost like having ""video-caller ID"" the person your contacting can see you as you call is coming through, they can either answer or decline it. Other than that it is a great app to use for video calling."	positive
411	1096918571	social	5	This is the most best face time app out there! So I have an iPhone and some of my family or friends don‚Äôt have a iPhone.

So they did I have family that live to far away and I can‚Äôt see them! So I texted saying get this app! And it works so good! The only problem is that it don‚Äôt have good quality. So I can‚Äôt properly see the person I‚Äôm talking too. Also it glitches and I can‚Äôt hear the very well. But other then that this is a wonder full app I recommend Getting it!	positive

413	1096918571	social	4	Google Duo is a great way to access people who can‚Äôt FaceTime and my grandma can‚Äôt FaceTime my phone for some reason so Google Duo really came in handy! I‚Äôm so glad people decided to make Google Duo because without it, there is no way to FaceTime people without FaceTime. Thank you for creating this! It did take a while to download, but that‚Äôs not going to be affective to my rating. I love Google Duo and adore it!!! Please people, make Google Duo the best app you have ever had! Though I do find it hard to use because the app drinks and drains battery very, very quickly and I saw that it dropped at least 30% after I used it once. Please do something about this.	positive
414	1096918571	social	4	Everything is great except that it has a constant pausing and sometimes cuts out audio during calls. I love the fact that I can face time with my friends who use Samsung since I have an iPhone.  You can send hearts to friends when they are feeling down or when you are far away from each other and miss one another.  The screen evenly fits so that you can see everyone at the same time and you even get to send fun video messages with fun little filters and overlays(somewhat like Snapchat.).  Definitely would recommend this app.  Very useful for business and just keeping in touch somewhat face to face through long distance.	positive
415	1096918571	social	3	The app is great, i use it a lot since I am in a military relationship. However for some reason the back camera doesn‚Äôt work, whenever I flip the camera it actually makes a buzzing noise and begins to shake making it impossible to use that camera and I have a newer phone (XS Max) and I don‚Äôt have this problem anywhere else or on any other video calling app. It‚Äôs a bit of an inconvenience but I manage. I‚Äôve tried restarting my phone and the app and uninstalling and re downloading the app but nothing worked. So if that could be looked into that would be great. Other than that it‚Äôs a wonderful app and very easy to use and great for long distance calling.	positive
416	1096918571	social	4	My boyfriend and I enjoy using Google Duo since he‚Äôs an OTR truck driver.  It does have bad video n sound quality but we think that it‚Äôs due to where he‚Äôs at when making the call.  BUT there is one irritating problem - Google Duo sends me a call from my boyfriend, briefly then disconnects. This happens at any hour of day or night.  I think something happened to him so I return the call only to find out he‚Äôs sound asleep and I‚Äôve woken him or when he‚Äôs driving. He says he didn‚Äôt make that particular call.  We‚Äôre in our 60‚Äôs so we don‚Äôt play those dumb games on each other. I‚Äôm tired of these fake calls. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a good app.	negative

When I click the volume buttons to adjust it, it displays the volume going down but the volume does not change.

426	1096918571	social	1	"First off, this is a Google product no? The company that sold you a Chromebook on the virtue of google products. Except Google Duo doesn‚Äôt work in Chromebooks. Let that sink in. 

Second, on a desktop... ahem... a non-Chromebook desktop... you can‚Äôt video chat with more than one person. Why? No one knows.

Third, if you‚Äôre using an iPhone to use this app (and suffering though poor video quality with every so tiny video boxes) you better be plugged in because this app drinks battery like your phone was powering a space heater.

Finally, even if you have multiple devices, this app won‚Äôt let you sign in with all of them, like other programs. It requires you to use gmail and a distinct phone number (why?) eliminating the possibility of dedicating one device to one think and the other to the video chat.

It‚Äôs the first product I‚Äôve ever come across in google‚Äôs product line I‚Äôve been wholeheartedly disappointed with. If it were 2005, this may get a few stars, but it‚Äôs 2020, there are a lot of competitors in this market, and it feels like Google is peddling VHS in the streaming age. Shop elsewhere."	positive

My friend from 3rd grade moved and her FaceTime wasn‚Äôt working so she tried this app. She told me to download it so we could still talk. To be honest this app is better than regular FaceTime, I had no glitches, the audio quality was great, and the quality of the video chat was great in general! I would definitely recommend this app especially if you are having glitches on regular FaceTime!	positive

 But there‚Äôs a slight problem. Anytime I turn my camera around to face away from me, it gets shaky. Not because my hand is shaking but because it‚Äôs glitched. If I prop it up against something, it continues to do it. It starts to get worse and more disfigured. It then goes completely gray and keeps moving. Nothing is wrong with my camera, because when I enter the camera app, nothing is shaky. In fact, it‚Äôs very good quality. So, I believe something is wrong with Duo itself."	negative
430	1096918571	social	1	"Duo uses phone numbers only for identifying which Duo apps to connect. Truth-be-told, ALL parties must be using a Duo app or the website. You certainly won‚Äôt be calling any and all phone numbers with this very limited app.

Hangouts is also cross-platform, but in addition, it ALSO allows voice calls with ALL mobile and landline voice numbers (NO Hangouts app needed). Also, Hangouts supports texting between any phone numbers that allow texting (again, NO Hangouts app needed). The only time Hangouts requires using a Hangouts app or website, is when doing video calls.

Yes, the quality of Duo video IS better than Hangouts video, but that alone does not make up for its major limitation of no connectivity of any kind, to most phone numbers."	positive

I want my child to y‚Äôall to relatives over seas, but she uses her tablet and does not have a number. The moment you open this app it ask for your number and I do not like that at all. I thought since this app is google all you would need is a email. I guess I was wrong. I would not recommend this all to parents out their. Other then the number problems the app is overall fine.

1-Let‚Äôs start with notifications. I don‚Äôt always get missed call notifications. Sometimes I get like a notification in the notification bar but when I open the app I don‚Äôt find anything or I find 2 of 5 missed calls, So how come I know who called me!!
2-The app does not show who is online and who is not. This is important because I need to know if the person I am calling is not online I just stop calling not to bother him
3- the voice speeds up and cut down usually during every call"	negative
434	1096918571	social	5	I have not been using this app for a long period of time but here is my review. This is a very helpful app because if you don‚Äôt have a apple type of phone and you have like a Samsung you might not be able to FaceTime but if you download Google Duo you can do the same thing as FaceTime it might look a little different but it‚Äôs still very helpful and less you communicate with others!!! If I would rate this one to ten I would rate it a 10 so I would recommend all of you to use this even though you have FaceTime or not	positive

Through Duo we were able to have our first dates and have spent the last year getting to see each other between visits using this app. It has been instrumental in our ability to get to know each other better and to cope with the distance. It doesn‚Äôt have bells and whistles which is perfect. We wanted a simple and easy to use interface that allowed us to see and talk. Excellent app Google!	positive
436	1096918571	social	5	You can talk to anyone and is is an easy way to reach out to your family and I love it real good and I don‚Äôt have no problem with it and every time I go some were i need to talk to my mom but she don‚Äôt have an apple phone so she got duo and that is how I talk to her because she d  ok have an I phone so it is amazing sometimes it break up but it is ok because if i hang up and call her right back it will not break up again and this is also a way to talk to my dad but he have and apple phone (kalis Cherry-Gaston)	positive
437	1096918571	social	1	"The setup would be ok with two factor authentication if the codes were sent out - but they are not. It also wants access to all of your contacts which gives them all to google. Not good. Deny access to contacts and perhaps that is why no two-factor authentication is sent out? 

The app may be great - but first you have to be able to use it. Without being able to receive two-factor codes, perhaps because of requiring access to contacts, this app looks like a loser. I verified other apps two factor authorization codes do make it through. Google‚Äôs do not at present.

Addendum:  two factor codes started arriving about an hour after they had been requested. Much too late. Still thumbs down."	positive
438	1096918571	social	4	This app is really slow. It glitches a lot and it will hang up randomly. Most of the time I can‚Äôt hear my friends talking. When I send duo videos it will randomly mute me so when it sends my friends can‚Äôt hear me. It is a nice app to have if you have anything other than apple because with apple you have FaceTime. I like that on google duo you can send videos if someone won‚Äôt call you back so you tell them what you have to say and then when they aren‚Äôt busy they can watch the video.I mean well there are options...... texting calling FaceTime google duo.	positive
439	1096918571	social	5	I‚Äôve had so many issues with FaceTime, messenger, WhatsApp and wechat when it comes to sustaining a video connection when my WiFi connectivity degrades, but I had zero problems with duo. I did have video drop out twice in a 2hr chat session but it does something none of the other apps do...it switched to audio only so I could still chat and the video came back within seconds. Also, the video was clear throughout whereas messenger used to always be beyond blurry. Love it!!	positive
440	1096918571	social	3	Awesome app. But would be nice if my video didnt pause when i minimize the app and the video window stays open in the corner like skype does. One draw back is it kills your battery super quick! Like within ten minutes its already drained a good 15% of the battery. As to other video chat apps, takes upto forty minutes or more to drain 15% of the battery. And this app causes the battery to get hot, especially while charging. And there's times the battery won't charge while on a video call it'll jus stay the same or even drain 1 or 2%. Please fix!!!	positive
441	1096918571	social	5	One of my best friends and I always talk on google dou. If you have an iPhone, using google dou is the same as FaceTiming with another apple user. Tiny problem is that there are little glitches that happen sometimes, but the app asks you if the quality was good or bad and if it was bad, you get to list the bad qualities that were happened FaceTime or regular call. Overall, the app is amazing and works even without internet	negative

443	1096918571	social	4	Wow I‚Äôm so amazed by this. So I wrote a review the other day saying how more effects should be added and the next day there was more!! Thank you so much!! But one more thing is I wish you could take a picture or video because sometimes I just wanna send a picture of myself without taking one in my phone then going to the app and sending it then so I would absolutely love it if you could take pictures. My rating on this has improved since you guys added those effects so quickly. Thanks!!!	positive
444	1096918571	social	4	It‚Äôs a good video calling app overall but the only issue is I use it to video call with my significant other and once they click off the app to do something else all audio is cut and they can‚Äôt hear me and eventually the call will just end, it didn‚Äôt do it when we first started using the app but now we don‚Äôt even use duo because once they go to sleep (we go to sleep on the phone) they turn their screen off so it doesn‚Äôt die or overheat but since their screen is off the call ends	negative
445	1096918571	social	4	There are a lot of things that I think you should do better for Delo. Like having a longer time when you record a video message. I personally like this app because it gives you a chance to FaceTime with your friends that have a Samsung. I know that there is more work on do you well and that he is still a work in progress but in all honesty this app has been great for contacting my best friends. This app has so much progress in it I have updates all the time. This app has So much potential.	positive
446	1096918571	social	1	I was testing how to use it before I invited others to try it to do a group video. I downloaded the app and tried to call friend‚Äôs account on their desktop (access by web browser). They tried to call me. I could see both of us trying to call each other multiple times and neither of us ever had a call go through. I checked the help and made sure notifications were turned on and contacts listed. Still didn‚Äôt work. I was disappointed with the customer support options. When I hit the feedback, it said not to expect a response. There was no way to ask for help except a vague call out to the community.	positive
447	1096918571	social	4	Ok so google duo is great and all I love to use it to talk to my friends that can‚Äôt FaceTime or anything but there is one problem in my opinion that u find it hard to use bc me and my friends always play roblox or some other group game and The audio shuts off whenever I play! Please fix this! I get so annoyed because I have to hang up and talk to them in the chat box! I really hate this please please fix this I have to play on my phone bc I don‚Äôt have a computer or anything else and I feel left out!	positive
448	1096918571	social	5	Before I got the app google duo I was stuck with iMessage, I could only FaceTime some of my friends. Most of my friends live in another state and I wanted to at least see their face, but I couldn‚Äôt. I was on the phone with one of my friends and she recommended to download google duo. You can call, FaceTime, or message anybody from anywhere. I have had this app for some time now and I don‚Äôt think there will be any reason I‚Äôll have a problem with it.	positive
449	1096918571	social	5	I like this app because it allows me to text and call my friends whenever I please. As you probably know some of my friends don‚Äôt have the same phone so this app works in all different types and kinds of phones. It has really great quality and they can hear my friends almost perfectly. When I say almost perfectly I have really bad Internet so when I hear my friends on this app it allows me to have a better time with them.	positive
450	462638897	health_and_fitness	4	I am absolutely hooked on my Fitbit! I bought the Charge 3 and I hate taking it off. I love the notifications it sends if I haven‚Äôt moved from my desk each hour, I love the fact you can challenge other friends and colleagues to weekend, or weekly challenges as well as track your own performance. It‚Äôs got me more motivated than any exercise book, or personal trainer. The only downside I find is that it‚Äôs not 100% accurate. My resting heart rate on an ECG machine compared to my Fitbit has a difference of 10 beats per minute...that‚Äôs a big number when you‚Äôre trying to work in fat burn mode or/and cardio. In addition, when I train with other people my steps are pretty much the same but when we e all walked a 12km walk (as we‚Äôve done consistently this week), my Fitbit comes up with almost 2km less than the others! The only time it‚Äôs accurate is if I walk with my GPS on my phone and then sync the data after my walk/run. In addition the calorie counter has very limited good options and scanning them and sending them off is too time consuming. I find I‚Äôm using the ‚ÄúMy Fitnesspal‚Äù app to monitor my food intake...please look at their app and try and make the Fitbit calorie counter more user friendly. Apologies for mentioning the bits that need ‚Äútweaking‚Äù,  but it‚Äôs constructive feedback that I feel is important. All in all I am so chuffed that I have a Fitbit as its now become a way of life for me! Thank you to the Fitbit team of developers ‚ò∫Ô∏è	positive
451	462638897	health_and_fitness	5	"Previous comments earning the app 3 stars a week ago: First time that the app has failed in over a year. So averaged out the number of stars to give it‚Äî with this week being 1 star and rest of year is 5. Since the latest update my Flex 2 wont sync. Ironic timing since I actually managed to finally do some serious exercising every day this week. I think the tracker is still storing data since I‚Äôm still getting silent alarms and notifications when wearing it. I hope it‚Äôs storing everything til bugs are fixed. Please!

Update with 5 stars to go with it:  I was so surprised that the developers responded to the problem I posted about syncing, and for that alone, I‚Äôd give the app 5 stars for customer service. But better yet, the FitBit help page that they directed me to had the solution. It was at end of webpage after a long list of things to try, most of which everyone probably does. At the end of the ‚Äútry this‚Äù suggestions, the one about how to reset the actual tracker did the trick. I never knew there was a little button on the charger itself for this purpose. Anyways, my Flex 2 tracker miraculously synced after I reset it, and it had stored a full week of data, exercise, sleep patterns, etc, which appeared happily in the app.   The developer‚Äôs reply to my initial review has the link to follow for how-to. Thanks so much for being repsonsive!"	positive
452	462638897	health_and_fitness	4	"I love my FitBit Versa and the FitBit app, but my one complaint would be the overwhelming number of clock faces to choose from and no real way to filter through them. The categories are broken down to only a few, at most, and the search feature isn‚Äôt really all that reliable for what you‚Äôre truly trying to search for. For example, when searching for ‚Äúbeach‚Äù it only shows a few options, but IF you have a large amount of free time to search through the extensive library one by one, you happen to come across several more while browsing. Maybe having a ‚Äútag‚Äù feature for clock face developers to add search keywords would be nice. It would also be nice if there was a feature to filter clock faces by which ones are free from those that you have to buy.

I‚Äôm also not fond of the calorie link option that FitBit incorporates with the MyFitnessPal app. It would be nice for a setting to be provided to select whether you only want workout calories that you‚Äôve burned to automatically link to your MyFitnessPal app versus your overall calorie burn for the day. I‚Äôm one who only likes to log my calorie burn for workouts and not the entire day. 

Those are overall my only two complaints. For the most part, the FitBit app is great, with the exception of these couple of things, but I‚Äôve also only owned my Versa for less than a week, so I‚Äôm still exploring the app."	positive
453	462638897	health_and_fitness	4	I‚Äôve had a Fitbit for 5 yrs now and use both it and the app religiously. There was a frustrating Firmware issue with the charge 2 and another device crapped out on me but Fitbit replaced and has since fixed everything. I now (still) have a Charge HR that has been running strong for 2.5 yrs... the App itself is great, I love the challenges and the navigation is easy/intuitive for the most part. One part I don‚Äôt like is the adventures area. So far it‚Äôs just places like Yosemite, NYC, Boston... Why? There are so many grand walks/hikes in so many areas of the world. There are also lots of other sites and apps that have countless walks/hikes mapped in whatever area you happen to be in but I‚Äôd much prefer to be able to access all of this from the Fitbit App. I‚Äôm stumped as to why Fitbit hasn‚Äôt extended the selection when it would be easy to load other walks and in turn be much more usable for everyone! It would also increase Fitbit usage and engagement. I remember thinking this when I first saw adventures on the front page of the app, clicked on it and saw just a few areas. Today I decided to check again and... 3-4 years later they still have the same few walks/hikes. This is so odd I‚Äôm kind of scratching my head as to why expanding this section hasn‚Äôt occurred to anyone at Fitbit, what the obstacles are (seems easy/doable and cost/benefit smart) and why it hasn‚Äôt happened?	positive
454	462638897	health_and_fitness	5	"I am giving my Fitbit Zip five stars, even though I only use the steps portion. It is fun, gives me good info about a job I have, where I am on my feet for my entire shift, and it is easy to use. 

It is true, you will add extra steps to get to a goal, and I don't consider myself a competitive person. I am sure the other elements of the Zip are great, but I am an online WW member, so I just use the FIT for upping my activity. 

I highly recommend this product. However I am adding a review of the Flex 2, (3 years later) which I hate. I lost my Fitbit zip and went with the Flex 2 when there was a long wait for  Zip delivery. I wish I hadn't. I give the Flex 0 stars. I have to download a new Fitbit app every time I try to sync the stupid thing. I've gone thru every help tip Fitbit offers, spent a long time on the phone with a person in customer support and have emailed the company for help. There has been no resolution. The company's support team used to be amazing, now they just read back text from the same help site I used when I tried to trouble shoot the problem. Also when the Flex 2 finally syncs (again after I download the app, again, for the third time that day) it seems to record arm movements. So if you are sitting down wrapping packages or painting your toenails you will also be getting in your steps. If you can get it to sync."	positive
455	462638897	health_and_fitness	4	Hi I‚Äôve had my Fitbit for a while and it is consistently helpful in tracking my sleep, food intake, drink intake, and menestral cycle. And of course, fitbit is known for tracking of activity and steps as well as heart rate. There is one complaint I have. I need a competitive atmosphere to enhance my healthy living. With the friends option you can challenge friends to like three different challenges. These challenges can easily get boring and unmotivated users if your friend runs track or something. I think it would be in fitbit and the health of the world‚Äôs intentions to have challenges dedicated to drinking enough water and reaching calorie goals and sleep goals as well. Activity is a big part of our health, however, when it comes to hydration, sleep, and nutrition many people are falling behind. With an increase in steps and activity. Fitbit should provide reminders to drink more water and to eat some food for more energy. I think that your healthy diet begins in the kitchen and ends with the right amount of steps. Without doing too much out of my way, I can usually achieve my step goal, but I often struggle with hydration and have fainting spells and sometimes get hospitalized due to lack of hydration. It is vital to a person‚Äôs well being to stay hydrated especially after working out or moving a lot. Thank you so much for listening and I hope you take my advice into account.	positive
456	462638897	health_and_fitness	3	"I bought my Fitbit Versa Lite after weight gain due to a back injury. It has done a wonderful job motivating me to move more and eat healthier. I‚Äôve lost four lbs in just the past few weeks. The sleep Score and record would be awesome if it worked accurately, but it is not working well at all for me. I‚Äôm in my mid-60‚Äôs and I wake up to go to the bathroom a few times a night. Even though I‚Äôm only up for a few minutes and usually fall right back asleep, the app splits my night into several segments, each usually under 3 hours so I only get the simplified sleep details for each (or sometimes for only one or two of them) even if I‚Äôm getting 5 hrs and 30 minutes total. I don‚Äôt understand why it doesn't just keep tallying my sleep noting those 2-3 min bathroom breaks as awake periods in the total night. Last night my Fitbit only recorded sleep from 3:15 am to 7:10. I actually went to bed at 11:30 and slept very soundly until 1:15. Went to the bathroom and right back to a sound sleep until 2:45 when I woke up briefly for another bathroom break, then, right back to sleep again. My app doesn‚Äôt show or count any of my sleep from 11:15-2:45 and there‚Äôs almost a 30 minute gap between me going back to sleep at 2:48 and 3:15 when it actually did begin recording my sleep. What‚Äôs up with that??  

I also wish the calorie count was more accurate. Selected items seem to be based on user input."	positive
457	462638897	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôve had my Fitbit Ionic for a year and a half and am very happy with it. This is my 3rd Fitbit and the Ionic addresses the issues I had with my first two ‚Äòbits, namely a one-day battery life and the fact I couldn‚Äôt immerse it in water. The data collected by my Ionic is logically and usefully displayed on the Fitbit app. I‚Äôm a recovering heart attack patient and the heart rate data compiled in the app is essential reading for my doctor. I transcribe the heart data onto my own spreadsheets and provide them to my doctor every time I have an appointment. The accuracy of the readings is impressive and consistent and when my numbers are taken three times a week at my cardiac rehab sessions at the hospital we‚Äôve come to use the Fitbit‚Äôs heart rate number over that of the nurse‚Äôs oximeter because my Fitbit tends to do a better job filtering out the ‚Äúwhite noise‚Äù of my a-fib condition. Medical science is a data-driven discipline and being able to provide my doctor with hard data each visit is immensely valuable. My last doctor‚Äôs appt in April lasted NINE MINUTES - all because I provided the spreadsheet numbers compiled by my Fitbit and displayed on the app. If you‚Äôre trying to talk to your doctor about your health and how you‚Äôre feeling and don‚Äôt have numbers to quantify your opinions, well, you‚Äôre only guessing.	positive
458	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	I like the FitBit app BUT the watch always has glitches. My text no longer come on my watch face like they did before and I have done every check, measure suggested and reset my watch to know end. Every time my husband and I do an update something else goes wrong and you half to guess which part of the watch or phone app won‚Äôt work this time. I have owned my watch for three years and the battle is constant. My husband two years. Since my last review and update my watch will not turn. I have cleaned the charging points, roughed them up with a brush and cleaned my charger, still it will not do what it is intended for. Also FitBit DOES NOT have the capability to change the battery which means a $200 Versa watch (at the time) is JUNK! So our solution to the problem has been to purchase Apple watches. It is spot on and has ZERO glitches in the month we have owned them and we have done one update. Where Apple lacks is its ability to have sleep, diet, and caloric monitoring in one place. IE you have to have a separate app for these things so for example I use FatSecret, pillow and 8Fit for these items. So in comparison if you want something that works use Apple but if your looking for a program that works half the time but is all in one place Fitbit is your solution. The only way I would go back to FitBit is if they made the batteries changeable because batteries loose there ability to charge over time even if you let them go dead and then recharge.	negative
459	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	"I love my Fitbit, just updated my hardware for the third time to the Charge 3 and I love it! However I had to leave a review for the first time ever to say how much I HATE the new version of the app. Before, you could customize the tiles and then you wouldn't have to mess with it ever again, now that's not the case, the challenges have been moved to the main screen, I constantly have to move the challenges out of the way, since they default to the very top, so I can keep the water tracking tile at the top. Once the challenge is over, they take a while to go away, which before it was on the main screen was fine, now that the challenge is on the main screen, they are just in the way of any new challenge. Plus you can't tell the difference between old and new challenges when you try to move them. And the main screen doesn't remember where you were when you click on a tile, so if you click on a tile, when you go back to the main screen, you return to the top, this is especially annoying if you have multiple challenges you are checking, since they are all named the same you have to find a new way to figure out which challenges you've already looked at and which you still need to look at.

I hate app updates just for the sake of doing an update. There have been improvements in the hardware that added value, Charge is now waterproof!, but there was no improvement to the app and now it's just terrible."	negative
460	462638897	health_and_fitness	3	"My Fitbit Flex works great with this app. The app works great most the time except for the few ‚Äúbugs‚Äù that it has. 
First one is the messaging part of the app. Whatever message is at the top of the screen is basically unreadable. It‚Äôs hidden under the top banner or menu or whatever. So I order to see it depending on how long it is I either have to pull down on all the messages or have my fianc√© send me a message so there‚Äôs a different one at the top. 
Second issue is the fact that I open up the app and it syncs just fine. However, there are several things that don‚Äôt refresh and show that they were synced or updated with new data. For example: weekly exercise, steps per hour, sleep information. Basically most things underneath the top circles. So, leaving the app and bringing it pack up doesn‚Äôt work. I literally have to close the app all the way and re open it to get everything to reflect what was already synced and updated. I‚Äôve been having to do this for several months. The last update didn‚Äôt fix it so I‚Äôm hoping someone reads this and can help fix it. It is not my phone. I‚Äôve tried turning it off and turning back on several times in the past months. 
Please help! I‚Äôve gotten to the point where the app is not really enjoyable anymore. Messages and my own data are a hassle."	positive
461	462638897	health_and_fitness	3	I‚Äôve had my Fitbit for over a year now, and I love checking the app through out the day to check my stats. The old tile dashboard made it so I could open the app and see all that I needed to see without scrolling. When they did the update at the end of 2019 and changed it to the white list screen, I was so upset, but hoped I would eventually get used to it and it would be fine. Six months later, not only do I still hate it, but I just realized, because I rarely bother scrolling, that I haven‚Äôt used my water intake feature or the steps per hour feature in months because I just kind of forgot they were there. I used these every single day before the update because they were right there when I opened the app in a visually pleasing and user-friendly tile dashboard. I‚Äôm writing this review now because I ended up scrolling down today and was like, woah, I totally forgot about these features. I don‚Äôt understand why, with such a huge amount of negative feedback from users, Fitbit doesn‚Äôt at least provide the option of switching back to the old dashboard - or at least, design an optional new dashboard that offers users the features they lost in the new one. Simply put, the new dashboard is terrible, and after giving it time to see if I‚Äôd get used to it, I still hate it.	negative
462	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	I think I speak for the whole Fitbit community when I say the former app style was far superior to the new one. I have no desire to even open the app anymore. It is not appealing at all. The old dashboard style was WONDERFUL ‚Äî you could open the app up and instantly view your stats in each little box without having to open each individual tile up, the card style was extremely visually appealing and fun to use, the fonts and colors were great. Now, the app is a major turn off with its new list view, small and uninviting font, and the stat previews are unfamiliar and no longer easy to understand. I am always open to change and updates but this new app style is definitely not a good one... especially when there are thousands of others complaining of the same thing. Fitbit, I hope you can incorporate a different app design similar to the old one, or I think you‚Äôll be losing a lotttt of customers. The old dashboard design was one of the most appealing things to me as a Fitbit user and I used to be excited to check it every day. Now I can‚Äôt stand it. :( Please have your design team look into this. I know that apps must always be streamlined and keep up with updated design styles, but there are ways to keep the old basics (card style, bright colors, large fun font and lots of icons) while still making it look fresh and new. Please consider this. All of us at the Fitbit community will greatly appreciate this!	positive
463	462638897	health_and_fitness	4	"Firstly I would like to say, the app works great. I hadn't used a fit bit in a year or two so I had to figure out how the new look of the app worked but it wasn't hard. I loved that my history from my old Fitbit was there because it gave me motivation to get back to how I used to be. 

Now the stuff I didn't like. 
I wish the messages would be more of a messenger style. I can't go back and look at the conversation as a whole, all I can see are messages sent to me and it's all separate so it clogs up the message list. Would be much better to see the whole convo in one message so I can have proof of incidents like I just had. I have friended a few people from the different communities in the app. So far everyone is cool, we are all there for fitness and support. I recently accepted a friend request and the guy started messaging me. It started out innocent enough just talking about how long we have had a Fitbit and what our fitness goals are. Then he started getting weird and talking about my face based off my profile picture and started hinting at sexual intentions. I ended up unfriending him and blocking him. What I wish for this app is a way to report users like this. This isn't a dating/hook up app! And I don't need strange men hinting that my face gave them a boner lol"	positive
464	462638897	health_and_fitness	4	This is a great app, keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. I love all the different features that can help you stay fit. This app encourages me to stay on my diet, or keep working out, or just maintaining a healthier lifestyle, even when the time gets tough. In addition, I really appreciate how you read and listen to these reviews. Just a suggestion: where you log your food, you can create a custom food but you can‚Äôt  delete or edit them. It would be very helpful if we could do both or either of those. I created a custom food because it wasn‚Äôt listed in the provided foods but I forgot a word in the title and it made it a completely different product from what it was. I really need to edit it and change it but that is not an option. Also, another thing that would be cool to have is if you could create a custom workout for your exercise. There is a limited number of options and I make up my own workouts and I would like to put it in the log. Likewise, where you can track where you run, hike, or walk is a very helpful feature! Could you, by any chance, add biking to that? It would make it a bit more useful for me. These are just a few suggestions that I believe would improve the app. Overall this app is great and I am so thankful for it!	positive
465	462638897	health_and_fitness	3	Quit messing with it. Every time you make a significant change in your algorithms around data collection it messes with the quality of the data set. For example when sleep stages came out it made changes to the resting heart rate calculations and I started getting new weird data patterns and I could no longer see the patterns in my menstrual cycle in the graph. Now you‚Äôve added this damned useless and meaningless sleep score that I can‚Äôt get rid of or change the prominence of and I have to dig to find the info I really need and want which is how long did I sleep and maybe how much REM did I get. Though I don‚Äôt trust that measurement anymore because around the same time as the update that brought the score I suddenly started getting much higher REM readings regularly with no changes to my behavior around sleep or my experience of my sleep. All this makes me distrust the data more and more. And let‚Äôs be honest- the fact that there are now all these new extra measurements and ‚Äúinsights‚Äù is a money making scheme because they are locked unless you subscribe to a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù account. I‚Äôm probably not going to ditch my Fitbit all together but I would no longer recommend it to someone else. It was a good product. Don‚Äôt go changing it just to change it or try to drive consumption you end up ruining it.	negative
466	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	My first versa didn‚Äôt even last a FULL year before it completely shut down and stopped working for good. Got my second versa about two weeks ago and it started giving problems today when it began to incorrectly record my caloric count while I was at the gym. I also noticed that the previous day, I racked up a total of almost 3k in caloric count and it reset on the watch and in the app around 8pm the night, so it ended up not recorded my caloric count that day. So I decided to do a hard reset. After hard resetting and setting up device (which took multiple tries since it didn‚Äôt work correctly the first few times) my device now won‚Äôt sync with the app. It currently says ‚Äúlooking...‚Äù I‚Äôm fed up with fit bit. I chose this watch over the apple series because the battery life last almost 6 days with a full charge and I‚Äôd be using it to track my physical activity as oppose to Apple Watch only lasting about 2 &1/2 days. I suspect my first versa had water damage (even though it is advertised to be waterproof) since I swim a lot, the screen went blank and the watch continued to work until it eventually died. I‚Äôm worried now because my current versa is giving the same software issues my previous one did leading up to its demise and it‚Äôs only been about two weeks since I opened the package. Please do better! For $200 this isn‚Äôt worth it to be honest and I really had high hopes for this... Very disappointed.	positive
467	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	"I‚Äôll start by saying I loved my Fitbit. I got it last Christmas and it has helped me to feel motivated and accomplished, as well as accountable. However, the new display that includes a sleep score is horribly demoralizing. Every morning I wake up to check my sleep - hours slept, when I woke up, how it compares to other nights. I use this information to try to improve my sleep and my stress levels. This morning, knowing I had a long, challenging day ahead, I saw that my sleep had been given an arbitrary 70-something score which I cannot remove to just view the actual data. It‚Äôs on every screen. That‚Äôs a C on a test. I felt miserable and like I wanted to give up, and now feel like I have to remove the sleep feature (a key reason I wanted a Fitbit to begin with) to avoid feeling like a failure every morning. Please make this feature optional or remove it altogether; you‚Äôve ruined the start of my day, where my Fitbit used to make me feel excited and happy to start the day off productively.

Update: The response I received from Fitbit makes no sense. ‚ÄúWe you can‚Äôt turn of the Sleep Score feature‚Äù? I can‚Äôt begin to understand what this means. This response and the lack of response from the company about this issue which has upset so many customers has now very seriously made me consider getting rid of my Fitbit altogether and getting something else. How are you going to fix this, Fitbit?"	positive
468	462638897	health_and_fitness	5	"I love my charge 3. I love how it tracks sleep and keeps track of my sleep stages. I love that I can track my runs, the splits, distance, and shows a map. Battery life is great. Notifications are great as well. 100% waterproof. The only time I take it off is to charge which I only have to do once a week. Also very durable I play basketball 3 times a week. Sometimes it will get hit by someone‚Äôs hand or the ball and my Fitbit shows no damage. I love Apple. Im bossed with my Mac and iPhone. But the Fitbit is way better than the Apple Watch and a fraction of the price. 

The app itself is great. Records the data very clearly and is easy to read. They send progress reports each week as well which are great compared to the last week. (I think it would be cool if that also got compared to your average stats) tracks all I see about and i can access it easily. Syncs very quickly as well. 

My one problem is it is very hard to read in the day light. The screen gets really dim and when on a run and I want to see my pace or trying to read a text message when it‚Äôs really bright outside it‚Äôs almost to read. I don‚Äôt know if Fitbit needs to fix that or if I can adjust it. Literally my only concern."	positive
469	462638897	health_and_fitness	3	I already wrote a review about the new app update and how terrible it is but I also wanted to write a review about how terrible the period tracker feature is! The interface on that has been horrible since they added it and I get frustrated EVERY SINGLE TIME I go to edit my period dates. The whole ‚Äúdrag the bar to fine tune your start and end dates‚Äù is annoying and does not respond well at all. It often gets stuck on one day and no matter what I do I cannot move it. Or I can‚Äôt get it to stop on the day I want. Why can‚Äôt we just select the dates manually without having to drag a bar? Also sometimes periods are irregular and maybe last a day or two and then go away for a day or two and come back, but the way this app does it currently is that you cannot add two separate periods in one month. You can only add the one so you cannot get it to display accurately at all. Make it so you can manually select each day and put in whether or not your period was on that day. I use Flow for my main period tracking since that app is dedicated to that and a million times better but I‚Äôd also like to track it in my Fitbit app since that‚Äôs where all my other health data is stored. Please please please fix this feature because it is terrible as it is right now.	negative
470	462638897	health_and_fitness	5	So I switched from Fitbit to Garmin back to Fitbit. Had I looked at the Ionic prior to switching I may not have switched at all. I disagree with other users that say the Ionic will not receive phone and text alerts. Mine is doing it fine. It was tricky to set up, requiring changing settings on my phone itself, but knock on wood, it works fine. The app is MUCH easier to navigate than the Garmin. My biggest complaint to date is that there is not a way to delete messages received via the Fitbit app. So some other Fitbit user whom you don‚Äôt know, can send you an inappropriate message, and you have to see it for the next 30 days. My last one was a user asking if ‚Äúmy pants are on.‚Äù I blocked the user, but I still had to see that message for 30 days. Seems like it should be an easy thing for developers, and I have seen many other requests for the same, so hopefully Fitbit listens soon. Other than that, having seen what the competition has to offer, I give the app 5 stars. And I recommend to other users to google how to set up your phone in addition to the Fitbit app so you can receive your notifications. Mine was an easy 3 second fix.	positive
471	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	"Account hacked and given no time table for getting information back. I need this for work-insurance discount.  Have trouble syncing after every time there is an update with my ionic and this last time my account was stolen somehow. Customer service stated they couldn‚Äôt tell me anything without my email and in the same breath said they saw my account synced at such and such time....contradicting. Disappointing.

Updated: After posting online on the forums which I thought was anonymous from my phone-my photo was still attached from my Fitbit account. Another person responded directing me to my settings. This is where the hacker email was, not my email account I used. I was able to reset my email back to the original there somehow by the app sending me a link. Why couldn‚Äôt customer service have done this for me 11 days ago when I called?  I had the hacker email address but was unable to login from the app after it was deleted or the website but was still connected to my account through the Apple App Store which is the only thing that saved me. Scary especially when I had Fitbit pay attached-won‚Äôt be doing this again. This also is my 4th product I have upgraded to, I love the Fitbit format but whenever there is an issue it‚Äôs a big hassle. Unfortunately after my iconic runs its course I will probably switch platforms other than continuing to use my Aria."	negative
472	462638897	health_and_fitness	4	"I have been using a Fitbit now for almost four years, initially purchasing one to motivate myself to walk to work and not waste money on cabs. That worked and of course I paid for the Fitbit within weeks! I now monitor my steps daily and find its pretty accurate. I have noticed that the distance is always off substantially (am guessing maybe I could set the step distance to correct that but haven‚Äôt bothered.) I love the challenges and connect with family and friends across the globe on a daily basis as we motivate each other to move. I‚Äôve even gifted multiple Fitbits to include some of my loved ones. My only gripe is that within the challenges, the comments have been incomplete for quite some time. I keep waiting for one of the updates to fix the error, but months later I am motivated to write this (seeing that many comments get a reply. üôÇ) To be clear, the wording such as ‚ÄòThat step goal was no match for...‚Äô is often cut off so that I can‚Äôt see the persons name. I always like and cheer comments and achievements but at times I am liking my own achievements due to the incomplete statements. I hope this makes sense and that Fitbit will rectify the issue soon.
Happy stepping to all!"	positive
473	462638897	health_and_fitness	3	This app is great but I think it could be better. It‚Äôs one of the first things I check in the morning to see how I slept. It‚Äôs really easy to use and encouraging to see all the numbers change.  The only thing this app is missing (and which I have to use another app for which is SUPER annoying) is the ability to create custom recipes so I can accurately put in dinner. Currently I have to put everything in by hand which isn‚Äôt the worst except I always have leftovers do I have to divide the recipe by thirds or something. It‚Äôd be a lot easier if I could just enter it once and say the serving size. It‚Äôd also be a lot easier if you could copy one meal from one day and place the same exact meal in another. This goes back to the leftover thing because if I make a complex dish, I have to remember everything I put in it for multiple days (thinking about the math) and it‚Äôs vaguely irritating. I also think that you should be able to track your macros more efficiently. The percentages are great and everything but they seem a bit useless if you‚Äôre actually trying to measure your protein or carb intake. But other than those things I really do enjoy the app. I just think it could be a little better and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be hard for them to do.	positive

Having the Fitbit prompt us is like having a personal coach living with us.  I also used the Fitbit to track my eating.  By having the ability to see calories in our food selections almost instantly, helped us with our food selections too.  Now back to why I titled this ‚ÄúLife Changer‚Äù.  My husband was a couch potato his entire life.  Fitbit got him into a daily walking routine.  We both lost weight - about 110 pounds between the two of us!  We both reduced the number of meds we needed each day.  And last quarterly diabetic check, our A1C was 6.2, prediabetic range.  We will always be diabetic, but thanks to the use of Fitbit, we can manage the disease.  We can not say enough good things about Fitbit and how easy the app is to use.  As a side note, I also like being able to walk with ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù.  I live in VA and walk with cousins in FL and PA.  We like cheering/taunting/messaging too.  I never get to see them so it is fun knowing our Fitbit app connects us through our walking - every day!  As I said, I could go on and on and....üíï	positive
475	462638897	health_and_fitness	5	"I absolutely love my Fitbit and the app but there is ONE thing that I would love to see improved. 

 I had a suggestion about the app and when you make changes to your goals (I.e. step goal, nutrition goal, etc) when you adjust your goals to be a little more intense, it makes it look like you didn‚Äôt meet your goals on past dates. Would it ever be possible to have the app updated so that when you update your goals it only affects entries and logs going forward from that change? Example, I changed my calorie deficit to -750 and I used to do -500 so now when I go look at my old entries before today‚Äôs date, they make it look like I was over my goal (when I actually met the goal I had been working on at that time.) just a suggestion that would not only help you see how often you are changing your goals but also to help you not feel discouraged when you look back and see that you didn‚Äôt actually exceed your calorie intake for the day, just had an old goal. :) I know for me personally, it would be really nice to see this update, but overall this Fitbit has changed my life!"	positive
476	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	"Edit: every time I want to sync my Fitbit, I have to remove the Fitbit and reinstall it! The ‚Äúhelpful links‚Äù the company sends you is ridiculous and useless! It is beyond frustrating to invest in a product you were happy with in the past just to have it flake out when you switch phones! I will be switching to an Apple Watch if this is not fixed soon!!! Ive been dealing with this since December and it isn‚Äôt getting any better or easier to deal with! 
I‚Äôve had two different types of fitbits and two different types of phones. I have to fight to have it sync with my apple phone! The time is constantly messed up unless it syncs up which I have to go in the app to do because it doesn‚Äôt want to do it on its own. This have even made be late to work because it took me a minute to realize the problem (who doesn‚Äôt rely on it as a watch and expect it to be wrong) I have two pretty premium products that won‚Äôt work together. As we speak right now, the time on the Fitbit is an hour off!!! It says to make sure they are close together so they can sync but I can‚Äôt imagine getting any closer than this!!! The app says ‚Äúlooking ‚Äú and ‚Äúunable to find‚Äù... really because I found it!!!... the phone is in my hand and the Fitbit is on my wrist!!! This is ridiculous already!!!!

477	462638897	health_and_fitness	4	"I have been a loyal Fitbit customer for over 3 years, often recommending the trackers to friends and relatives.  I credit the app and device for helping me lose 90 lbs and keep it off.  I especially like that the app includes food tracking and that anyone can add foods that they use and are not already included.

However, the recent update in early July had major bugs introduced to the food log.  The app was updated within a week to address the bugs in the roll out.  I am now happier with the product and reaction time it took FitBit to address the problems.

I do wish they had a more clear way to offer feedback, suggestions, and requests.  For example, one sometime may mid-enter food nutrition data (I have done this by accident as well as having run across obviously erroneous entries).  Currently there is no clear method to report these aberrations so the log can be cleaned up.  Another example is the recent roll out of Female Health Information that can show up on your dashboard.  This may be useful to some in helping to track cycles and get pregnant, but the app already knows my age.  Given I am over 60, my interest in this new feature on my dash is below ZERO."	positive
478	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	"I have had 3 different Fitbit watches and I absolutely love them and the software over the years. I run, bike and hike all the time, something every day. I love the heart rate data and fitness scores, sleep tracker and female health. I think they are great health tools, whether or not you‚Äôre as active as I am. HOWEVER since the update right before GOOGLE BOUGHT FITBIT, you are now required to keep location on ‚Äúalways‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwhile using app‚Äù, which uses a ton of data and drains your battery. My phone told me one day that Fitbit had fetched my location 49 times that day. FORTY NINE TIMES. No wonder my battery lasted half a day instead of 2. 
You were always required to have the app open on your phone to track GPS during an activity (i.e. while using the app, makes sense), not at all an inconvenience. I think they are using the new ‚Äúauto start‚Äù tracking feature as an excuse, but it‚Äôs really to mine all the data because that feature is useless. 
Now, since I refuse to pay to be another cog in the Google machine, I have to switch my setting to ‚Äúalways‚Äù from ‚Äúwhile using the app‚Äù every other day when I start a run. Not fun. Extremely disappointed with this move. I will NOT be replacing my watch with another Fitbit, probably go with Garmin and deal with getting used to another app. I hate change but this isn‚Äôt worth it."	negative
479	462638897	health_and_fitness	2	"I was really excited when Fitbit came out with the Charge 3. I like the improved processor, water resistance and choice of bands. 
I‚Äôm really disappointed that they put the exercise apps on the device rather than stopping and starting them from the app on the phone. This creates all sorts of problems. The clock and blood pressure reading on the device is readable. The settings to start and stop a particular exercise or not. The print is not bright enough, outside, and certainly not large enough to read without pulling out my ‚Äúreaders‚Äù, which I don‚Äôt take to the gym or out cycling. Also the time period displayed is not long enough to read the fine print. I know it will take some programming, but put the exercises settings , starting and stopping, etc., on the app on the phone, not on the device. Even stopping an exercise takes multiple swipes on the tiny screen. It goes to a pause, and then whatever... just to get to the stop button. The end result is really messed up exercise measurements and frustration. Also please give us a choice on the phone app as to what notifications we want sent to the tiny device on my wrist. If I wanted an Apple Watch I would have bought one. I have had the Charge, the Charge 2, and now the Charge 3. It would be an excellent device with the above modifications."	negative
480	462638897	health_and_fitness	2	... I were asked to rate this app a few weeks ago. Recently I was forced to use a new dashboard. Their community board said that select users were asked if they wanted to try a new dashboard but all I remember is opening the app and everything had changed. I think this is a rather sneaky way to get feedback from a beta of your app changes but I could get past that point if there were significant improvements. There weren‚Äôt. The new dashboard was more difficult to read, very bland, no visible animations when goals were achieved and did I mention that once you got the new dashboard you could not roll back?  I have been a Fitbit customer for about 3 years now. Up until the ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù I would have given the app at least 4 stars. I used the Fitbit and app to track my activity, food, sleep etc and have lost over 20 pounds. I loved it. It made it even more disappointing to me because of how much I depended on it for my routine. It still works... mostly... though I have had issues with syncing lately. I would recommend checking the community board. Three weeks ago I would have whole heartily recommended this product. Now I can‚Äôt. Fitbit if you are reading this please give us back the old better dashboard or an option of dashboards.	positive
481	462638897	health_and_fitness	2	"This is my 2nd time leaving review.....I have been a Fitbit user for 4+ years, beginning with Charge, then Alta HR, and now for 2 years, Fitbit 3. I use the fit it‚Äôs daily, love them.  Saying that, I am very disappointed and frustrated with the app performance.  I bought Fitbit 3 for the ability to track swimming, as well as biking. It had worked seamlessly for a long time.  I loved that I could receive texts and notifications.  The notifications stopped work months ago. I have done all the exercises recommended to restore them, which sometimes worked, but only for a day or less. I have an iPhone XR and IPad, which are both up to date.  I am unable get it to sync.  Some days it will, some days not.  I have reset Fitbit and have disconnected Bluetooth and re synced. Sometimes it works, again for a short time, and other times no.  
If the benefits of my Fitbit cannot be enjoyed, or not enjoyed without a constant fight, I might as well have a cheap knockoff that does nothing else.  Or maybe it is time to shop for another brand that can consistently provide the features purchased.  I want to have my app there synced when I open and I want to receive the notifications, as it did before.  I am done jumping through hoops just to get it to work!  Thanks for your time."	positive
482	462638897	health_and_fitness	3	"Hi,

I‚Äôve been using the Fitbit for almost 6 months. I really loved it before the update. I hate the sleep score. I love tracking the hours and getting the weekly sleep average. I don‚Äôt look forward to seeing my sleep stats anymore. I also loved the dashboard and tiles before. The list is a MAJOR downgrade for me. I also felt soooo accomplished when my goals were reached and got the green stars. I‚Äôm not a fan of the new layout. I must repeat I absolutely loathe the sleep score with every fiber of my being. I don‚Äôt care about a score. I can‚Äôt even say I fully understand it and I hate it so much I have no desire to learn or read what it‚Äôs about (and I love to read). Yeah, so I‚Äôm purposely remaining ignorant to spite an app feature. I‚Äôm petty for my sleep tracker. I care about my hours slept and my weekly average. Can we at least do both? Or have the option to have on or the other? If the score had been added instead of replacing then I wouldn‚Äôt feel such anger towards a tool meant to help. I also am refusing to use the challenges because a lot of people are saying they remain on the dashboard after being completed and that would irk my nerve. I do enjoy this app, just not as much as before all the changes. Thank you."	positive
483	462638897	health_and_fitness	4	One thing that I thing is leaving this app is the adventures. They used to have the Chicago routes that you could run through as well as the vernal falls route, valley loop route and my personal favorite, the Pohono trail, but Fitbit has cut all of the Chicago adventures and the vernal falls route. Please listen when I say that the adventures to me are the most important element to this app and I really want more. Aside from the adventures I have a Fitbit ionic which has failed me a few times but after talking with people at Fitbit, we managed to get it working to the best of its abilities and I for one love the exercise features, there are so many that are given to me in such a simple manner that it is easy to know accurately everything that was going on during my workout, I am primarily a runner and I think the Fitbit ionic is best suited for these types of people because the GPS is the best that I have seen in a smart watch. And what is even more is that the battery lasts so long and I‚Äôm two years into using my Fitbit and the battery still doesn‚Äôt seem to be faltering. The app is, to me at least, the best fitness app out there and I would love to see more adventure races come to the app.	positive
484	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	"I‚Äôm so frustrated with this app!  I keep getting a poor GPS warning when trying to track my walks. I‚Äôve reset the Fitbit (Flex2), deleted the app from my phone/added it again, ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù the Fitbit/connected it again, turned my phone off/restarted it, took my phone in to the apple store to check the GPS (it‚Äôs great)...I‚Äôve tried everything! With my previous Flex (1), it would work if I changed the type of exercise (used hike or run instead of walk) but wouldn‚Äôt work for walk (kinda indicates it‚Äôs a problem within the app) but that won‚Äôt work now, either. I will literally be sitting on my couch, using WiFi, and the tracker shows me moving all over the place...I ‚Äúwalked‚Äù 2 miles in 7 minutes while sitting on my couch! This just started in the last few months, for me, but other users‚Äô help posts indicate it‚Äôs been going on for years. Ugh!
Addendum: I have been back and forth with the techs at Fitbit. I have checked everything they‚Äôve suggested, and the mobile run is still completely inaccurate (doubles my stats), and I keep getting redundant answers from them, but the bottom line is: it doesn‚Äôt work, I can‚Äôt use it! So I changed my review to one star. It worked. It stopped working. With two different devices! So, why do I even need a Fitbit, if I can‚Äôt track my workouts?

485	462638897	health_and_fitness	5	So I had my Fitbit for a while now and then my fianc√© got me an Apple Watch as an earlier wedding gift.

Some are ok with their Fitbit watches, and some just want Apple Watches, and we would all love to be able to both continue competing with one another. Please make this possible! I‚Äôve read that sync solver app helps but then I read that it only syncs your data but it does not put the steps into the competitions. Any input on this would greatly be appreciated!

However I am really frustrated ad annoyed with the water log. It doesn't add correctly and you have to close and then reopen the app or sometimes sync with the charge 2. This has been like this from day one of getting my charge 2.Then yesterday it wouldn't add one of my entries even after closing and reopening the app as well as syncing and I had to enter it in a second one so it would show the right amount of water intake. It amazes the app can do all these other fancy things but can't add water intake properly?

2/6/19 Update: my Fitbit Charge 2 Display had went out and I bought a Fitbit Charge 3. Everything is still very good on the app and it seems on the Charge 3 the sync is faster. However the issue with the water log stills acts the same. It almost appears that you can‚Äôt add water intake entries while the app is in sync with the Fitbit?

I had to spend $700 on a new phone to finally get my device to sync properly, but now that it works, it works really great, and the new features are pretty cool. Fitbit is a rich man‚Äôs device, and is not designed for the every day Joe who just wants something to track their heart rate, sleep, and activity level. If you have an extra $1000 lying around every few years to make sure your phone and device sync up properly, then check out the Fitbit! If not, maybe check out a different fitness tracking company 

Original: I‚Äôve been an avid Fitbit user since the first charge came out, but now that I‚Äôve gone through three bands, and am having syncing issues, I‚Äôm reconsidering giving this company any more money. I love it when it works, but, like so many 21st century gadgets, it works when it‚Äôs the latest model, then becomes obsolete 6 months later. I use it for my own personal tracking and for a watch, but that‚Äôs about all it‚Äôs good for any more. I‚Äôm going to buy a regular watch and keep my phone in my back pocket to track my steps once this tracker dies. Save yourself the trouble and spend your money on something else"	positive
490	462638897	health_and_fitness	3	"I‚Äôve been an avid fibit user for the past two years. Love the app and its user friendly interface. Besides the step count and heart rate measurements, my favorite features are the silent alarms and sleep functions. Fitbit tracks your sleep and even the specific stages of sleep. Additionally, their silent alarms feature has made getting up in the mornings easier. It wakes me up better than a sound alarm plus it doesn‚Äôt bother my partner in the mornings. 

Recently, fitbit updated the app, changes the appearance of the dashboard. It is a stylish new update, but takes up more space than the previous version. Before, you could easily look at your stats at a glance. However, the update requires you to scroll quite a bit to see everything. 

In addition, the update has made it more difficult to set the silent alarms. Instead of being able to add it from the main page, users now have to navigate to the account page, then the fitbit settings, and then finally access the silent alarms. This process makes changing the settings more circuitous. Please change the app back to the previous version or add a functional feature to change the alarms from the ‚Äútoday‚Äù page!"	positive
491	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	I loved my fitbit when I first got it but shortly after I have had nothing but problems! From time issues because apparently not syncing right to battery issues to app issues to it freezing up and most importantly it is poor quality and falls apart! I have super glued this countless times & even called & had it replaced but still had same problems. Customer service was rude & questioned me & gave me hard time about my daughters and why my daughter under 16 had one... They would only replace one even though we were having problems with both. Later did same thing to my husband and wouldn‚Äôt replace. His doesn‚Äôt work anymore, mine is completely falling apart and my daughters won‚Äôt sync right! Now I just did an upgrade well tried to anyway & it is completely frozen doing nothing but has what looks like a charging bar across it. Held button down & reset 4x, attempted to charge, sync it & try update over & over & still nothing!! So fed up! Will be looking into different brand! Otherwise I love everything it does & track & that lots of friends were using & could compete but many friends stopped using and I wonder if this is why... I know others complained & I have seen others whose are falling apart! To many other brands out there that do same thing to stay with the crap product!	positive
492	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	"I never leave reviews so the fact that I‚Äôm doing one now means I‚Äôm particularly disappointed. Customers need to know that Fitbit has essentially sold out and made the app absolute trash. It used to work great before the company sold. Now, it doesn‚Äôt load properly. To see your stats it has immense lag to load your basic information from previous days. Basic information that was once free is now premium. The app, which was once colorful, fun and motivating to look at, looks awful and ugly. Worst of all- new challenges with other players are displayed at the very top of the page and supersedes your basic info (important info like heart rate is buried under all the challenges so you need to scroll ALL the way down to see it, whereas previous app (prior to Fitbit being bought) had everything upon opening the app... customizable and easy to read, with all need-to-know info at the top). New customers won‚Äôt know the difference perhaps and can just adapt, but you‚Äôre alienating your old loyal customer base by doing this. 

Fitbit- you broke a good thing. I‚Äôve owned your products since 2015 (starting with the Fitbit surge) and I‚Äôm actually researching Garmin products because of how this app was destroyed and made useless. Please get your act together and figure it out because I‚Äôm pretty much about to move on."	positive
493	462638897	health_and_fitness	2	I‚Äôve had my Fitbit since last year. Now the thing is vibrating like crazy and will not stop until I plug it into the charger. I‚Äôm very cautious about downloading safe apps that aren‚Äôt effected I have three apps. Snapchat,Pok√©mon go, I heart radio, which all have good reviews. Now I‚Äôm not sure why my Fitbit is acting up I tried resetting the user data on my charge 3 it still didn‚Äôt help with the problem, I even tried restarting it that wouldn‚Äôt help matters ether. Y‚Äôall are making me mad. I‚Äôve requested so many updates in the past and I never received them, and now my Charge 3 is acting up, I keep all my apps updated regularly as soon as an update comes out I update including Fitbit. So I‚Äôm not sure what the problem is but I‚Äôm tired of dealing with it. Please provide me with you customer care number, so I can see what I need to do, but my Fitbit should not be too old all ready. I just got it last Christmas should last longer than that. I always do all the updates to my Fitbit as well when they rarely come out which we need more updates for the Fitbit itself. Bug fixing updates. As of right now my Fitbit is dead, and I‚Äôm so scared to use it, because I‚Äôm not sure what it‚Äôs gonna do	negative
494	462638897	health_and_fitness	1	"I‚Äôve been using Fitbit since getting a versa for Christmas last year. I like all of the things it tracks and wear it pretty religiously. I was hoping to be able to use it to compare how my activity changes throughout a typical year. I would like it 10x better, though, if the app weren‚Äôt so glitchy. Every once in a while it just ‚Äúdecides‚Äù not to sync, my watch will say I got 12/12 hours active for the day and the app will only say 8/12 or so. After the last update (Oct 2, 2019), it also quit automatically tracking walks/runs (they now need to be manually put in) and for some reason the ‚Äúactive minutes‚Äù update throughout the day with no movement - sometimes even going backwards. I had 21 yesterday at 2 o‚Äôclock and then by the time I went to bed it only said 9... when I had gone for a walk/run after 2. Wish they‚Äôd fix all of this nonsense with the app so it gave a more realistic idea of activity...

Update, December 2019: I‚Äôve officially had this thing for a year and it‚Äôs great when the app cooperates. Really rather frustrating when it doesn‚Äôt. Make all of the minutes/hours/steps? App may or may not sync properly and give you credit for doing so in your weekly reports. It‚Äôs just too glitchy - even if you keep it updated. (Some updates make everything work less???)"	positive
495	462638897	health_and_fitness	2	When I first got my Fitbit I loved it! The product itself and app has been great up until about 4-5 months ago when I updated my phone and no longer received notifications through my Fitbit. Fit bit issued a email about the issue and said they were working on it. I googled the issue and was surprised that I clearly was not the only one having this problem. I have no tried following all the steps given on the Fitbit app to help resolve this issue, I‚Äôve tried emailing fit but with still no response, and still having the same issue with not receiving texts although phone calls now all of a sudden come through. Being that my fit bit was not cheap when purchased I would think customer service would be more helpful and any issues regarding the way it should work would be resolved. Disappointed this feature is no longer working being that in my job I depend on texts coming through my watch while I‚Äôm working and knowing if I‚Äôm needing to get back to a text ASAP being it‚Äôs a client of mine or knowing I can continue doing my job and get back to whoever it may be later. If anyone is reading this over at Fitbit customer service your help would be greatly appreciated	positive
496	462638897	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôll preface this by saying that I was a long-time Apple Watch user.  I hit a point where the constant notifications from my Apple Watch were stressing me out so I ditched it and got a Fitbit Inspire HR and I have to say, I‚Äôm really loving it!  I have a nice mechanical watch that I like wearing on my dominant wrist and I wear my Fitbit on the other wrist - I didn‚Äôt really need a smart watch, just a fitness tracker.  I really like how the Fitbit is fitness-centric and I like the small form factor of the inspire.  It encourages me to move when I‚Äôve been sitting for too long and I love having my steps right on my wrist - seeing them regularly pushes me to hit and exceed fitness goals.  Also, the app is second to none.  Aside from my Apple Watch, I‚Äôve also had Garmin devices in the past and from an app perspective, the Fitbit app is way better than both.  It‚Äôs intuitive and loaded with tons of valuable health stats - it‚Äôs kind of your go-to dashboard for all things health and fitness.  For the price you pay for a Fitbit, this is all a tremendous value.  I think I‚Äôm going to be a Fitbit user for a long time.	positive
497	462638897	health_and_fitness	3	I have loved my Fitbit for years. In fact, I have never had a complaint. Until now. iOS 13 seems to have thrown the IT department for a tailspin and all functioning capacity of my Versa has dissipated like a passing rain on a southern Florida afternoon. The feature driving me the most batty is the messaging which once provided me a bit of privacy to my locked phone. I was able to keep it locked, hide previews of any content on screen to curious onlookers, and decide for myself if I need to pick it up or just let it go. NOW, thanks to the bizarre manner in which I have to go about resetting my phone, making all private matters open for any onlookers, and other troublesome bumble, wandering eyes are yet again set to the screen of my phone every time it alights and whatever visible content displays is no longer mine alone. I‚Äôve more than once thought of ditching the Versa after this fit of nonsense but I‚Äôm waiting for the bugs to settle down and I‚Äôm hoping Fitbit will see fit to restore one‚Äôs sense of privacy as was previously given. Aside from this glaring intrusion, I have been quite pleased as it has been otherwise smooth sailing with this device.	positive
498	462638897	health_and_fitness	4	I really enjoy this app. It‚Äôs motivating to keep moving during the day with reminders each hour. I love the sleep insights. I don‚Äôt use the meal diary so can‚Äôt speak to that. I have a crossfit membership so I don‚Äôt have to come up with workouts, but I think the trainer section is pretty cool with built in workouts even though I don‚Äôt really use them. However, I would love a section of weight loss tracking. It‚Äôs great to be able to set a goal and update your weight when you want. But I‚Äôve not found a feature that lets you track the progress with a graph or even a table of previous weigh ins. Seeing that chart go down is super motivating and My Fitness Pal is a much better option for that.  I also just found the hiking challenge section which is really interesting. You go to a ‚Äúdestination‚Äù and as you accumulate steps you hit landmarks on the trail with really awesome photos. The only challenge I have with it is once you‚Äôre in the photo the only way I can figure to get out of it is to ‚Äúshare‚Äù to the Fitbit community. I don‚Äôt love that. Overall, great app.	positive
499	462638897	health_and_fitness	2	"Since last update, my indoor walks show significantly less miles. I wear both Apple Watch and Fitbit charge 3. Before last update, the miles recorded on Fitbit was just a little lower than Apple Watch . I could live with that. Today after 30 minute indoor walk, Apple Watch recorded 1.72 miles. Fitbit Charge 3 only recorded 0.51 miles. What Happened?

Addendum:  Took me over 2 hours of combing through chat forums. But found out the reason why my indoor walk mileage was so lo was because Fitbit automatically added gps to walk workout. Finding out how to disengage that function was what I had trouble with. You can‚Äôt do it from the mobile app or the Fitbit app for the computer. You actually have to go to the Fitbit website from your desktop computer and login there. I had play around in the app to find the function to turn off the gps function. I have since forgotten where that function is. But the function to turn gps off and on should be more accessible. It should be on the mobile app.   My other complaint is that I have location services set to  access Fitbit app only when in use. Now that app is constantly remind me to change that setting so that location services can always access Fitbit app."	negative
500	985746746	social	4	So discord has been pretty much great overall, I love using it every day and never really had any problems with how it looked or worked, until this recent update. Now, while during a call, when I lock my phone on my iPhone, discord shows up as a call for everyone to see and access, like an iPhone call. I do not feel comfortable that anyone can just see that I‚Äôm on a discord call; that‚Äôs what I liked about discord. I could only access the call via the app, that‚Äôs why I used discord. If I wanted to access the call via the lock, I would‚Äôve just called someone. Now discord is acting like an iOS phone call by making a new tab appear which is also annoying and difficult to just look at and manage with other apps that are opened. There was no original issue with how discord calls were displayed, now they‚Äôre blatantly out in the open for people to see and I believe it‚Äôs not convenient at all. It also bugs out when I just try to lock my phone sometimes. It won‚Äôt actually lock and when I tap my phone, the call will appear with the new look and my phone will be unlocked. I know you guys are trying something new but this is a bit of a stretch. Discord was discord by not looking like an iPhone/apple created application. At least make it an option to remove the display of the discord call on the lock screen, it would be greatly appreciated by those who desire some privacy.	negative
501	985746746	social	3	"Discord is an amazing app that lets you do casual conversations without the loud notifications you would usually get from text messages. It does an amazing job at keeping notifications hidden when you want them to be.
But I cannot say the same for calls. Recently, Discord started integrating their calls with actual phone calls. This means that every time I get called on Discord, it goes through to my ringtone. The whole reason I use Discord is to keep my online life separate from my personal life. 
Although there is a setting that allows you to disable this feature, I still get the ringtone. Whenever I get called on Discord, even though the app is closed, I still get a ringtone. I even have all notifications turned off in my settings. The ringtone only lasts about 2 seconds before it realizes that it should not be there, but it gets pretty annoying, since it forces me to stop whatever i‚Äôm doing on my phone.
What annoys me the most is that this issue has been fixed before. The previous update had the setting that disabled the integrated phone calls, but it actually did its job, unlike this recent update. I had no calls going through no matter how much I was getting spammed with calls. 
I thought this problem would be gone forever, but it still managed to find its way back. I‚Äôve resorted to having to delete the app just to avoid the ringtone...again. Please fix this issue."	negative
502	985746746	social	4	I love Discord, I have been using it for over 2 years now on both mobile and pc. Everything about Discord is great! It helps me keep in touch with friends and helps me make new ones! And the app is good quality itself! But there is only one issue I have. Every time someone calls me on Discord even if I have my notifications off, it goes through. I understand that you may want to be notified if someone calls you but the thing is it goes though as if it was a real phone call stopping me from what I was doing on my phone just to have a call notification block my screen. And the only way I have been able to fix the problem so that calls don't go through is putting my phone on Do Not Disturb but most of the time it blocks other important calls from family and people I know. If I don't answer or decline the Discord call the call goes to my call history which I don't enjoy. Even if I mute a group chat the call still goes through. What I'm saying is to make call notifications go through when we actually want them to and to make them stop invading to screen and to make them stop going through our call history. Im not sure if all of this is possible but if you could at least do one of those I would be delighted and give the app a full 5 stars, but for now its staying 4 stars. I hope you understand.	negative
503	985746746	social	3	Sure, Discord is much better in terms of quality, but by far my biggest complaint is the removal of the private mode option while calling people. I deserve a right to privacy, as does everyone else, and it‚Äôs too loud for that to be an option. Other people can hear my conversations and it‚Äôs very bothersome. I miss having the option between the two. Don‚Äôt fix something that isn‚Äôt broken please! Otherwise, there‚Äôs this constant bug with webcams/ turning on your camera. sometimes it never loads and you have to turn it off and on to get it to work properly. I‚Äôve had to do this up to 3 times maximum to get it to work finally, which is nothing at first, but becomes annoying. Finally, (most likely not 100% discord‚Äôs fault, you can ignore this if you want) the connection seems to be getting worse. I used to love discord for the quality of the calls, but several times a week the quality becomes so bad that I have to restart the call several times to understand a sentence the recipient. The most common connection issue is definitely the that audio seems to skip out entirely for a few seconds sometimes. I understand that this could also be due to my own connection and the recipient‚Äôs connection, so take this with a grain of salt. Considering that, many times before there has been nothing wrong with our internet and this still happens.	negative
504	985746746	social	3	"From the very beginning, I have had numerous problems with this app. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because when it does work, it is phenomenal. 
When I first got the app, it wouldn‚Äôt let me join the server I wanted to and said I was banned (even though I‚Äôd never used the app before). I re-downloaded the app recently because I was joining a clan and they required discord. I got the app and I was still logged into my old account, which was glitched, so I created a new one. I actually had to create that account on my browser because the app didn‚Äôt even let me do that. I created my account and tried to login on the app, no success. I‚Äôve re-downloaded the app numerous times since then and still, no success logging in. Luckily, my browser still works and I use that to chat with my clan. Unfortunately, even when I turn my phone sideways, I can‚Äôt see all of the writing because it shows all the members of the group on the right hand side and it takes up half of the screen. Then, I have to read downwards one letter at a time and I don‚Äôt have the patience for that, especially with all of the scrolling it requires. If I could get on the app and not have to worry about that, I would have no complaints, but this simple fix is ruining the entire app for me. If you want people to use your app, they have to be able to create an account, but so far I haven‚Äôt had any luck with that."	positive
505	985746746	social	4	"Discord is a great tool for gaming, streaming, and almost anything you need out of a communication service/application. Yet it is lacking sometimes there is server lag or buggy happening on pc and the phone version usually just the phone version but its come along way and most of the bad issues are completely fixed. I just wish it was more compatible with certain devices, for example i don't have a great pc but it is good enough to play arma 2 - 3 with 60 frames yet discord likes to kill my cpu time usually freezes and such as well, despite playing with the prioity setting it higher or lower doesn't fix the problem. Ios version seems fine most of the time but sometimes has server lag or disconnects. But all in all its one of the best alternatives to paid communication services for gaming and streaming, and i am if it wasn't free it would be the best of paid applications, its simple you can create free servers and manage those servers with ease. btw in your update log you wrote ""with relative easy"" instead of relative ease. The best part i would say is how easy and how quickly you can create and connect with people so you can just get into your game and start playing. Thank you discord! i hope you continue to improve and fix this application, its been a few years since i have even looked at teamspeak and its all thanks to you guys|~<3"	positive
506	985746746	social	3	"Before berating it, I‚Äôm going to give the team a thumbs up, since they created an app that essentially beats all other social media‚Äôs in its versatility and usage. It‚Äôs an easy to understand usage, for me, and simple to join servers. And the ability to create various rooms for various things also is good and creative as it allows for different topics to be shared. 

However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill. It‚Äôs difficult to get started, and when you‚Äôre using it there are always issues while doing it. When in a discord call in a Server, it works fine for a portion of the time in it. However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,
Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work. Please pay more attention to the mobile version, to make it equal to the laptop version, as it is difficult and a struggle to use. Thank you."	positive
507	985746746	social	2	"I like Discord for what it offers, but the iOS app crashes randomly whenever I try to load a picture, gif, song, or other upload someone else posted, and crashes when I try to post pictures quite frequently. I know that a lot of people upload stuff, so the fact that it crashes as often as it does is a major concern for me. 

Another issue is that the app has decided to randomly mark all messages in random chat channels as read when I open them, even though I‚Äôve still got dozens to read before I reach the end of the string. Or I‚Äôll be reading the messages, and suddenly it marked all messages as read, to include ones that happen while I‚Äôm reading, and not even remotely caught up. It happens randomly, so I don‚Äôt even know what might be the issue. It might happen to a chat every time I open it, or just once in a while but it‚Äôs a bug I want to see gone. Being tagged in a message, and then having that indicator removed randomly is an issue. I don‚Äôt always have time to read everything in one sitting, so I want to be assured that I can read it later. It is a major issue when it starts you over at the end of the conversation, and doesn‚Äôt save from where you had to leave off. (This is mostly for my admin duties on servers.)

I like that I have the ability to take Discord with me, but if I can‚Äôt use it half the time, then it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even have it at all."	positive
508	985746746	social	5	I love love love this app, it is very useful and I use it all the time but there is this special feature called ‚ÄúCustom Status‚Äù which you can only make one custom status sadly. I wish you can make way more of them or probably a limit higher than 1. But other than that it is a really good app and hope you will have a great time with this amazing app! Also another problem is that for some weird reason now it started to lock me out of the app and it doesn‚Äôt let me get on it. It keeps getting me out of the app. Also can you make it so you can change the profile of somebody in your group, kinda like the nickname, and make it so you can have banned letters/words and an only this word/letter must be used in the text channel. It would make it easier when you have multiple bots with different prefixes like the rythm bot that lets you listen to music, you can make a rythm only text channel that allows you to only say the ‚Äú!‚Äù prefix. And can you also make a customizable background, if it is too much to ask for a background then you don‚Äôt have to do that but please add the other features. Thank you so much for reading my note! Hopefully you read it all. From: The0neAndOnlyNoob#4598 :)	positive
509	985746746	social	4	"In short, it's ugly af, and feels incredibly intrusive. The previous ui design was much nicer to look at, and much less in the way and in your face.

Please remove this asap, or change it to something more akin to the previous design. I'm seeing a lot of other people expressing dislike of it, so I hope that will help convince you to change it back.

On a side note: I'm someone who really needs empty space when using things. Not too long ago, Twitter completely updated their website, and in doing so removed a significant amount of empty space which was previously present. Until a plugin was developed to set it back to the previous design, I actually could not use the website. Something similar happened recently with Discord to a lesser extent, specifically with the friends tab. The recent addition of the ""active now"" section removed a lot of the empty space which was previously present, and as a result I can rarely use that tab without needing to look away or click something else immediately. This new update again takes away more empty space with the new ui changes, albeit to a notably lesser extent, but it's enough for it to instill at least some discomfort for me while using Discord."	negative
510	985746746	social	5	I have been only using Discord for about 6 months and have loved it too much! I keep it open 24/7 to see what friends are playing and love chatting with them while we play games! I have loved all the fun features that Discord has to offer! You can create a massively public server or a small little server for your gaming peeps! Also, it is so easy to manage the server! Everything is so clear and easy to navigate when you own a server! I love it how you can customize the roles and have other people have higher roles and being in the group of people which everyone is! I love the things that you can do when you don‚Äôt even own a server like try and earn respect and climb up the ranks! It is like a little civilization that you are in with a bunch of other people! The settings and security of Discord is great! I love the fact that you can completely secure yourself and only allow messages from people you know or having the freedom to meet people! Plus what I have researched Discord is like unhackable! You can do so many things with Discord that it‚Äôs mind blowing! Anyone who is uncertain of getting Discord read above and just get it!	positive

Complaints and suggestions, two things often misunderstood. But I am here to say I am not making a complaint. All i suggest is that we have the same options as computer users. I‚Äôd like to change my game status on my mobile phone because obviously i‚Äôm not able to take my computer just anywhere with me. The games mode isn‚Äôt available in the app or web login unless it‚Äôs on the computer. It slightly bums me out but since discoed has always been such a great app
i overlook it. I think everyone would be happy if the game status option would be on mobile as well. Playing on the go IS a thing. Why not add it for us too? All in all that is my suggestion, the ability to change my game status on mobile just like in my computer. Yes, I understand that this may take time. But it is worth waiting for and I know you and your team can accomplish it. Thank you for reading and have a great rest of your day.

512	985746746	social	2	"Discord works great on a desktop computer/laptop, other than finding the right chat room and general navigation issues like getting a message noise but never seeing the message because you were in a voice chat room.  Could use a redesign.  Like why isn‚Äôt voice just enable in the same chat room so there‚Äôs no switching back and forth?

However, this review is for the mobile app.  It doesn‚Äôt work.  Every time I do so much as sneeze (another app notification/text message comes in, if I get a phone call, etc.) the app stops working.  I get that the voice should stop but after switching apps and coming back or after ending the phone call, the Discord app never recovers and must be restarted, rejoin the room, and then it works...for a while.  Until almost anything else happens.  Worst of all, when my phone falls asleep, so does Discord, sometimes.  It‚Äôs unpredictable when I‚Äôm just randomly disconnected from Discord.  My friend reported his phone calls not coming through when he‚Äôs on a Discord voice channel. Not sure which problem is worse.

I‚Äôd highly recommend using a different app. Often, my friends and I just use a phone conference call.  And I can send a text message while on a phone call. So how does this app improve my gaming other than taking bandwidth from my gaming?"	negative
513	985746746	social	5	I started to use discord around a year ago, with that said I use it for everything, I own a few gaming teams and it is so nice to communicate with other team members, other teams, etc etc, I also use discord to communicate with friends, teammates ( especially in games where a mic is not supported ) discord does not affect my frames which is something I enjoy, I can still play my favorite games with discord open without sacrificing graphics or frame, I also have a few servers which I moderate and using bot support I can easily put up chat filters to prevent people from using certain words that may be deemed inappropriate, setting discord up was surprisingly easy and I had no trouble what so ever, I have never been let down by discord either, there servers have never been down allowing me to always communicate the quality is purely amazing, for any game devs out there I would use this as this app allowed my favorite developers to host polls, show updates, and even do giveaways, simply put this is the best way of communication for any devs, gamers, or fans, and even friends and would highly suggest that you get this app	positive
514	985746746	social	5	"I love discord! I‚Äôve always loved it on the desktop version, and have had no issues with it on there. I get mobile is behind and you can‚Äôt really get all the features, and of course it‚Äôll be different, but I absolutely HATE that calls act as phone calls now. The sole reason I switched from typically using FaceTime Audio calls to Discord calls was to be able to lock my phone while talking, have my phone on my bed without the screen turning off when something covered the sensor, other people not being able to see what or who I was talking to, and it not stuffing up my call logs. Discord used to be wonderful. The thing that bothers me the most is not being able to lock my phone without the call ending. An absolute pet peeve of mine and it‚Äôs awful. Please please take it away, we were FINE without it. Stop trying to be FaceTime.

EDIT: You‚Äôve now gained back my affection, discord. You rolled back those changes and now the app is wonderful and back to how it used to be! 5 stars for this amazing app and customer service that actually reads reviews and takes action!!! Very Impressed!"	positive
515	985746746	social	4	"I‚Äôve been using Discord for about a year and half now, the app for maybe a year. They‚Äôre been a lot of improvements since then that I was happy to see. The CallKit was definitely not one of them. I wish there was an option to at least disable it. I don‚Äôt like my Discord calls showing up in my history. I don‚Äôt like Discord calls ringing on my phone like a normal call. 
Also, I‚Äôve had a lot of audio problems since it was added. My alarm goes off? Can‚Äôt hear or talk anymore, have to leave and rejoin the call. Someone calls my phone? I can‚Äôt just mute my mic and answer anymore. I have to hang up. And even if I decline the call? Audio problems. Can‚Äôt hear. I also hardly ever get proper notifications anymore. People send me messages, but I don‚Äôt realize I get them because the sound doesn‚Äôt go off while I‚Äôm in a call. A few times I just never got a notification at all. And I‚Äôve missed a lot of calls because Discord never rang. 
I actually like the new update that lets you choose whether or not to use speaker. I was sad to see the option go, so I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs back. Wish speaker was default though. Still, it‚Äôs nice to have the option."	positive
516	985746746	social	5	Perfect on PC, well... the camera mode on PC nearly broke my PC and broke my discord, so I had to delete it. So I used the online version and it does work and so when it was broke on my PC I was trying to fix it but I gave up after a while, so I downloaded it on mobile to be able to talk to my friend because he can‚Äôt call or text. So I go on the mobile version of discord and I like to talk to him and the sound is broke. I can hardly hear him, so I turn up the volume, doesn‚Äôt work, turn up the discord volume, doesn‚Äôt work, and finally I turn up his volume so I can hear him better, (and you wouldn‚Äôt guess this) IT DOES NOT WORK. Only then do I find the online, but I do want to play with him when I‚Äôm not at my house and I hope it works this time. The only reason I gave it 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äôs because it helps me reach my friends that I can‚Äôt call or text and it works well when I don‚Äôt use the camera, and I could get in contact with online friends that I don‚Äôt know irl without giving to much information but I get to talk with them. I hope to get a developer response explaining why I had problems.	positive
517	985746746	social	2	"Out of all of the social media platforms I‚Äôve tried, discord I would say is the most toxic of them. 
And it‚Äôs not because the employees and staff working at discord are mean, or anything, it‚Äôs because of the nature of the setup discord chooses to use. Essentially when you join a server, the guidelines you have are the ones the owner sets for you. Larger servers are often governed by mods. But the problem is that these mods generally don‚Äôt have too many qualifications to be a moderator. And when the mods are ineffective at creating a safe environment, that‚Äôs when toxic behavior thrives. Discord does have some policies, on its ToS but these are generally very simple rules, and are few and far between. I‚Äôve had many terrible experiences on servers where toxic behavior is present and the mods either do nothing about it or they take the wrong course of action. Now this isn‚Äôt something discord has much control over, but rather design of the website in it‚Äôs entirety is flawed. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app to people who who are not in a healthy state of mind, or to anyone in general. However I guess discord works for some people and if you find that this style of social media works for you then by all means download it. But do be prepared for possible toxic behavior thrown your way."	negative
518	985746746	social	5	I absolutely love this app. Finding a gaming partner is way easier using this! I‚Äôve actually found a group of people that I frequently game with and talk to that I honestly really love. My experience this past year has been really amazing, and without trouble. However, only one thing really annoyed me in my time using discord. When you want to leave a server you‚Äôve created, you have the option to pass ownership to someone you trust or someone that‚Äôs qualified. It isn‚Äôt the same for group chats, though. If I had created a group chat, and had to leave, I would also want to pass the ability of owner to someone trusted, but it randomly picks a member to make the new owner. As the owner, I think I should be the one making that choice. Because even though I absolutely love my discord friends, some of them tend to abuse the power of owner chaotically, and I don‚Äôt want to be added back into that kind of environment. Leaving a group chat you and wanting to be added back soon just leads to you crossing your fingers and hoping someone worthy got the crown.	positive
519	985746746	social	5	Discord is a great alternative to other apps, I got it because I was in a group and that group required you having Discord, and at first it was really complicated but then I got a hang of things. The problem started randomly, what would happen is whenever I open Discord it goes completely black, like the first time this happened I literally thought my IPad died, but nope. I closed the application, and on the screen, it showed ‚Äúdiscord‚Äù but the app screen was almost empty discord was going very faint, and I can‚Äôt do anything on discord, I deleted it and reinstalled it multiple times. Still, nothing changed, idk what to do now, because when my clan is hosting a training or a patrol to get promoted, we NEED to be in Voice Chat. This has been limiting my ability to be a active member in my clan, the only way I can use Voice Chat or chat or other servers is by using my phone. But using a iPad to play games, and a phone to communicate is really hard. Other than this I have had no problems whatsoever. This would have been a five star but this issue has made things VERY difficult. Please Help.	positive
520	985746746	social	4	All in all, it's a great app.  In fact, I'd say it's nearly perfect on PC.  However, there are some features on PC that you can just not access on mobile.  For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.  Another thing is that you can't change somebody's role on mobile, which is very aggravating. I'm a moderator on a server and we have a specific role to give to misbehaving people which prevents them from sending messages.  But, I can only do my job as moderator if I'm on my PC, because mobile won't let me change roles.  In addition, for whatever reason, certain pictures refuse to upload, and it‚Äôs not the channel settings because it‚Äôs only with certain pictures (only on mobile).  The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.  I know that's probably gonna be controversial, but I personally know that some of my friends are big YouTubers, so they get caught up, and forget.  However, if I was able to tell if they'd read my message, I'd be able to yell at ‚Äî er, uh, talk to them about it.	positive
521	985746746	social	1	This app logged me out several times and it won‚Äôt let me log in no matter how many accounts I make. It logged me out, but I already saved my acc password and user, so I tried using that. It failed saying that the email was not registered so I thought ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs no big deal I can just try registering again with the same email cause it says the email is apparently ‚Äònot registered‚Äô yet‚Äù so I did that and THEN sit said that the email was ‚Äòalready registered‚Äô. Okay WHAT?! So I tried creating an acc again, it failed. I tried signing back IN again, still a fail. And I know it‚Äôs not my technology glitching our non kyle and that it‚Äôs apps fault bc no matter how many devices I tried to switch to, it still wouldn‚Äôt work. I used to like this app a bit before this stuff started happened cause this app is really good for like if your friend dosent have a phone and can only text on pc or something like that and it‚Äôs also good for gaming and streaming I guess but if you keep getting logged out, there‚Äôs no point of giving the app a good review, especially if your like me and have been downloading and deleting the app several times with no success and have literally been trying this for over 4 DAYS STRAIGHT!!!! The developer(s) should really fix this problem before it gets a lot more bad reviews due to this glitch.	positive
522	985746746	social	5	"What can I say about Discord? I started using it a year or so ago off of a friends recommendation, and I have no interest in going back to any of the multiple VOIP programs I‚Äôve used in the past (Xfire, Skype, C3, Steam, Mumble, Teamspeak, Razer Comms); Discord beats out all of those for one major reason: Absolute control over everything. The ability to create and manage my own channel with access to just about every detail keeps me coming back, and makes things so much easier on me. Volume sliders on everybody giving me peace of mind on how loud (or quiet) people are being, being able to voice/text mute people that are being abusive in chat, and having multiple text/voice channels is just icing on the cake.

I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt write a review for Discord till they rolled out with the video call/screenshare update on PC, and they did so here I am. 

If you‚Äôre wanting a reliable, free, all-access VOIP program for your gaming or chatting needs, Discord is for you. With their optional Discord Nitro subscription offer I hope they never run out of money to support this gem."	positive
523	985746746	social	5	Heya! I just wanna say I love using Discord especially on mobile devices when I don‚Äôt have a laptop, and it‚Äôs quite a fun app to chat with others.  However, there are some things that I want to have Discord improve on or at least try to help with the app to make it better, especially for mobile devices.  One thing in particular is to have more color choices for roles and to customize role colors on mobile devices.  Another thing is when I see some people‚Äôs status when it says something like ‚ÄúPlaying Sleeping‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlaying And 3...2...1..‚Äù, etc, I want that option to be available to mobile devices, or if that is already available, please respond to me with how I would do that.  One last thing is when I try to save a picture with a transparent background, when I go look at it in my photos, it doesn‚Äôt go from a white background to taping to a black background. I really would like these issues to be fixed in the next update or two.  Other than that, this app is very great and I love how it is improving but by bit! Keep up the great work!	positive
524	985746746	social	2	"I've been using discord since early 2016 & absolutely loved it, but the decisions made during 2019 have left me very unimpressed with the staff's lack professionalism when handling serious issues. I was completely unable to use the app or the desktop version due to the April fool's ""joke"" they decided to pull that completely removed their entire platform's functionality from disabled users, including myself. I sent emails to support only to be greeted with replies of the support staff flat out lying to me about the ""prank"" being a permanent redesign for the platform after I told them that I could no longer use it due to a disability. Luckily it was reverted back, but rather than actually addressing the seriousness of the situation, the team behind Discord's social media played along with people complaining about bringing light mode back. The newest update the Apple version received is just not exactly very functional for most users, options that were once quick to access have been moved to a separate menu & you need to go through that menu to even change your profile's online status. It's just extremely unpractical for most users & the way it's designed & functions just doesn't make much sense."	positive
525	985746746	social	5	I am personally a fan of Discord and the idea behind it. It is common where friends are playing A video game or something, and don‚Äôt have a way to communicate except the X-Box chat or something. Also, Discord is very helpful for those who don‚Äôt have a phone number, or only have a tablet or computer. It allows you to speak to your friends, and you are the person who controls who you text, unless a friend invites you to a server. But all you have to do to void that is simply ignore it. It allows kids who don‚Äôt have the option to just simply FaceTime or text a friend to do so, and that‚Äôs a big thing that I love about this. Not only does it have to be about gaming, you can use it as a way to study. Discord allows you to use a normal key board, allowing you to use fonts, Bitmoji, and normal emojis, so you can send text messages like you regularly would. One of the best parts about it is that you can delete and re download it, and etc, but it will always save any chats you may have had. Discord is one of my favorite apps, honestly.	positive
526	985746746	social	2	Sometimes I love Discord. The audio quality is much better than normal phone calls and it‚Äôs a great way to text my friends aside from Snapchat and iMessage. But a lot of the time it either doesn‚Äôt work and I can‚Äôt hear who I‚Äôm on the phone with, or today for example it won‚Äôt connect at all. It‚Äôs actually making me very anxious because there may be something important on Discord. In my opinion this is a very poorly made app, I think that if you‚Äôre going to take the time and pay the money to create an app as popular as Discord then you should at least make it effective. I looked online and apparently sometimes Discord can be ‚Äúdown‚Äù (Which is bizarre. I‚Äôve had it with Snapchat too.) which is very disappointing to me. In my opinion these apps should never go ‚Äúdown‚Äù. iMessage is never down, so why are these? It boggles my mind sometimes how poorly made this app is. And no I won‚Äôt delete it because I use it often. But I am very strongly requesting a major improvement, because this isn‚Äôt working. This is bad. Somebody really needs to get to fixing it. If your apps are ‚Äúdown‚Äù that is a major issue, because you‚Äôre the ones making the app not us and our use of the app is on our time and not yours. Thank you.	negative
527	985746746	social	5	"I love Discord. It‚Äôs really addicting, especially with the bots. I can easily talk to my friends on it, voice chat, and even find new people that share the same interests as me. While some people complain at the fact that some bots cost money to gain full access to, I don‚Äôt mind. I mean, they have to find some way to fund it and make money, right? Discord didn‚Äôt even make the bots. Discord Nitro is the only way Discord has to support itself, so people should really be more grateful that they aren‚Äôt required to use it and that they don‚Äôt have to spend every minute closing an ad. Discord is one of the only add free apps that I can use, so I appreciate that also.

The only problem I have with the app is when I‚Äôm in it, it will sometimes exit me out randomly. While this isn‚Äôt a problem since I can just go back into it, it gets annoying at times. I would love if you could fix that. :)

Overall, this is a great app. I don‚Äôt see anything Discord could improve on besides the bugs, so I rate it a 5/5 easy to use app."	positive
528	985746746	social	3	"This latest update has caused the app to awkwardly lag at points. Especially when it comes to trying to use discord emojis. I find myself accidentally sending my message before it even registers that I‚Äôve clicked on what emoji I want. I‚Äôve never had this happen before, and though it doesn‚Äôt seem like much of an issue, it also goes for typing as well. It‚Äôs like I completely miss letters, and it just doesn‚Äôt register that I‚Äôm tapping on them. This doesn‚Äôt happen anywhere else, and I haven‚Äôt had any problems with my phone otherwise.
Also I‚Äôd really prefer it if autocorrect went back to the way it was, where you could send things and not have it change after pressing send. The last word becomes drastically changed way too often, and it‚Äôs especially annoying when I‚Äôm trying to catch a pokemon and it no longer sends what I type and instead what autocorrect thinks I‚Äôm trying to say. Maybe this doesn‚Äôt pose as a huge deal to others, but I really do hope you‚Äôll reconsider forcing autocorrect when pressing send. I‚Äôve become so used to it not doing it that it now bugs the heckers out of me.
Other than that, I love discord üëçüèª"	positive
529	985746746	social	2	"Okay. Let me just state that I love discord upfront. I‚Äôve used the app daily for over 2 years now and overall it‚Äôs so much better than things like Skype and I‚Äôve met many new friends. However, the most recent update released today (May 11,2019) there are some things I just really dislike a lot. 
First off, they moved the search button feature and I used that a lot so now I accidentally start calls and would really prefer (at the very least) the option to move it back. 
Second, calls now come up as an actual phone call and show in recent phone logs. It also opens a new tab that is uncloseable and seems to be always on ‚Äúconnecting...‚Äù even though I can hear my friend and my friend can hear me clearly. I can‚Äôt close this secondary ‚Äúphone‚Äù tab without ending the call and it‚Äôs really frustrating and I‚Äôm really hoping you guys will revert the call settings to how it used to be. 
On another note, just a mild annoyance, when calls now start, it automatically plays audio on speaker and I wish there was a way to switch it to the private call setting. 
Hope these issues get fixed, otherwise I‚Äôll have to take a break from using such a great app."	positive
530	985746746	social	4	"I‚Äôve been using discord for several years, but every update seems to make the app worse. I see very few people in the reviews actually liking the IOS integrated calling. Please, for the sake of your dedicated user base, reverse it or make it optional. I cannot stand the fact that I cannot lock my phone during a call. Not to mention the constant cutting out during voice calls and connection issues. (Which have just gotten worse, may I add) It‚Äôs so bad that me and my boyfriend have considered switching apps. This is ridiculous. If I wanted to have a phone call where I couldn‚Äôt lock my phone and the screen goes black when my hand covers the top of my phone, I would have just used the regular iPhone calling system. Fix. This. Or risk losing business. This is turning into Skype and I left that platform for very similar reasons. Love this app but hate what you are doing to it. Really have hope that you will fix these issues and understand that people don‚Äôt like the integrated calling system.

UPDATE: Thank you, discord, for fixing your app. Appreciate it!"	positive
531	985746746	social	4	Discord is an amazing app, and I love it. But the mobile version is missing quite a few important features. For example, Discord on mobile (possibly IOS only) doesn't have Audit Logs for server moderation. Audit Logs are very important for server moderation, so that is one flaw with the mobile app. Also, only a minor setback this is, is the fact that there is no emote button on the mobile app. Yes, you can easily tap the emoji button on your keyboard, but if you are in a server with global emotes, you have to type out the names of the emote. But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app! These setbacks can be overlooked, so Discord is STILL my main way of contacting friends.	positive
532	985746746	social	3	"Discord is generally a good app that I use frequently to chat with friends. However, recently with the new updates, I‚Äôve noticed quality in calls drop. Granted, the calls were never super great for me, but unlike before, it would consistently mute my friends so that I would have to leave and rejoin, then it‚Äôd work. Not only that, but my friends would often cut out several times during call. It could be a network issue and I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt 100% discord‚Äôs fault, however it‚Äôs been frequent and annoying at times. Another issue I‚Äôve been experiencing is really annoying. For some reason, discord has completely stopped working at random intervals. What I mean is that even though I get notifications, when I try to launch the app, the loading glitches and I‚Äôm forced out. The only way to fix this to my knowledge is deleting the app and downloading it again. It is happening more and more frequently and is an issue I‚Äôve experienced ever since the latest update
Other than that, discord is great. It‚Äôs an easy app to use to chat with friends and I would give it a higher rating if not for the issues I stated."	negative
533	985746746	social	4	"I have been a user of Discord for over a year and a half, with my experience being extremely positive. However, recently the user interface has been changed and I‚Äôve received many complaints about it being too childish and distracting. On several occasions I have been accidentally voice called because of the UI update. I‚Äôve also had a myriad of people say that is too cluttered and they preferred the older layout. My moderators struggle with all the extra bells and whistles strapped to the mobile version of this application. I am here today with a proposal for two different modes; one is for people who want to play with the revisions and the other is for those who don‚Äôt want to be constantly assaulted with a waterfall of bloat they don‚Äôt use. I know that I‚Äôm a single voice but I‚Äôm here to speak for everyone who‚Äôs told me their issues with the new UI. I just want my server members and friends to be happy and it makes it hard on them if they can‚Äôt even tell where the pinned comments are.

Hello Discord Developers & Future Discord Customers. I would say I highly Recommend Discord for Gamers, Streamers, and more. You can create a Group with different Channels while Group Owners Get To Download and Program Bots That can Moderate the Chat/Voice Channels.

For Discord Developers
Amazing Job with all the Features and of course creating the app. I would want it to switch everything to subscriptions so then it‚Äôs free but you can upgrade to a Premium Member for $5.99 Per 3 Months and they get access to Emojis Created by Discord, Access To Sharing Nature Sounds (Frogs, Birds, Etc...), and they can create Premium Channels which allows channel members to Like, Favorite, and/or Dislike a Message and a Special Bot That the Channel Owner can add. I also want a Membership Called ‚ÄòStar Streamer‚Äô which allows the Streamer to Sell Merch and Donations, Use Special Animations on a Avatar (e.g. Dance, Floss, Dab, Etc...), and to add share Videos where they can Name, Describe, and Monetize with a Tip Jar+LeaderBoard where Channel Members can Donate. So kind of a Twitch/Youtube thing."	positive
535	985746746	social	3	"I love discord and it‚Äôs a great hub for socializing and finding new friends, especially people to play games with. BUT this recent update where private calls showing up on the lock screen while okay, also shows up in my phones recent call log which is not okay. I‚Äôm a private person with an extremely busybody mom that I still love with and who still enjoys spying on things that she has no business sticking her nose in at my age. Discord‚Äôs private calls was a nice way to speak to my friends without getting the third degree but now I have to go into my call logs and make sure all discord calls are deleted now which is not something I had to previous do. 

On top of that, discord calls seem to be getting poor in connection to the point I‚Äôve been considering finding a new app to use for voice calls, especially when competitive gaming of which I do frequently in Dead By Daylight. 

Discord, please stop making yourselves look pretty and fix these issues that never used to be issues. I want private calls 100% to stay in discord app, if I wanted to make a phone call I wouldn‚Äôt be using you."	positive
536	985746746	social	2	"Old Discord was so much better honestly. Less lag and more privacy when in a call and your phone was locked and didn't show you in a call. Discord bugs out calls so often when you try and join back in a call with someone and still says connecting until both of you guys restart the call. I understand new layout and everything is great, but if you actually fix any bugs and issues, that be great too, and please bring back old Discord from few months prior where we actually HAD our privacy in a call not being shown on our lock screen. It makes it hard because power button can also make you leave the call which is even more annoying and because you can leave the call accidentally by pressing or tapping on your earbuds which is mildly irritating.

Apparently you fixed that issue lock screen issue apparently few days or a week ago now. Thank you, but others issues would be nice please because I really do enjoy your app, but it irritates me when I often complain how there's still bugs when it comes to calls and text not working while in a call sometimes until you reset Discord"	neutral
537	985746746	social	5	"On discord, a lot of potential stress about interacting with people is taken away since it‚Äôs mostly through text. (But there is also a verbal chat option if you prefer talking) If spending time with people in person wears you out or is stressful to you, discord is a great way to make friends at your own pace.

Edit: Since the new update, there have been in app notifications that block other things and can‚Äôt be turned off. In order to stop them, you have to mute everything which would also get rid of notifications out of the app which I do not want to turn off. These really takes away from the experience. I‚Äôve seen developer responses on other reviews saying they are working on a way to disable the in app notifications and this will be in the next update. I really hope that update comes soon. Until then, I‚Äôm lowering my rating of a 5 out of 5 stars to a 4 out of 5 stars.

Edit: They have since fixed the problem."	negative
538	985746746	social	3	Hey, so. I started to use this app so i could communicate with others, especially yters who have discord servers. As a mistake, I misspelled my email by one letter, so i went to change it because I needed to verify it to be able to message in some servers ,and since the email is incorrect, it wouldn‚Äôt send the message to my gmail/mail for verification. As I went to correct my email and hit save, it would give me a message. The message simply said something along the lines of, ‚Äúemail has already been registered.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure what it meant by this, because i never verified my actual email just yet. Thus, once i hit save it wouldn‚Äôt change it. I‚Äôm currently stuck with an incorrect email that can‚Äôt be verified nor changed to the right one, because it‚Äôs misspelled so it wont send. Is there anything I can do to be able to change my email?? Oh, And i‚Äôm on mobile too... if that has something to do with it. What exactly does the message ‚ÄúEmail already been registered‚Äù mean. My email hasn‚Äôt been able to be added yet!! And I haven‚Äôt given anyone access to it either.	negative
539	985746746	social	4	"Discord can be used for many things, Chatting with friends, DM friends, group chats, ETC. I use Discord daily because it where my friends and fans (I‚Äôm a youtuber) chat with me, the idea of letting you make roles and emojis is brilliant and a original idea. You can also use it just like messaging but without giving your phone # away. Although it does need fixes.
I use IOS and one problem that I have just recently encountered is that my discord broke, I would log onto the app and it would freeze and bring me back to the home page. I deleted the app then downloaded it again hoping it would work, unfortunately it didn‚Äôt. The next day I go on my settings to see if there were any bugs and apparently discord isn‚Äôt a app on my phone anymore, what? I am confused. Besides that it does glitch out every now and then showing old messages and then after you send a message it loads the new ones first. 
Besides that discord is a great app and fun for ‚Äúall ages‚Äù I would encourage you to download it."	positive
540	985746746	social	4	I think this to be a pretty cool application considering it‚Äôs a free to use messaging and calling service, which also lets you create your own servers for your own gaming communities/other things that may need discussion. One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you‚Äôre using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can‚Äôt do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I‚Äôm listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.	positive

I use it to video chat my family, text my friends from school, call people from around the WORLD to play games. Discord just makes me want to play games even more. The interaction I can get in one single app is amazing and all the emotes having ways to express yourself! The discord nitro with amazing moving emotes even better! And it‚Äôs amazingly cheap. Discord‚Äôs logo makes it look fun and wumpus plush is just so cute I love wumpus ^.^ also you can make YOUR OWN EMOTE!!!! You can have channels dedicated to other games for people around the world to interact in. It‚Äôs simple and easy to use. Whats even better is pining your favorite pictures or links! It‚Äôs helpful to find once so far up the chat. I appreciate discord so much for giving me such an amazing app to interact in. No other app can compete best of all its all FREE! ( except nitro ) but it‚Äôs cheap as fuuuudge. Everything else is free lol	positive

EDIT: I've changed my rating because I've been running into a problem again that I assumed was handled in the later updates from the early versions of discord. The app will attempt to upload images and then completely crash and close out, even with images that I've sent through it before. The only thing that will fix this issue is deleting and re-installing the app, which can be a timesuck, but this issue always comes back. I've deleted the app 3 separate times prior to this trying to fix the issue and it's a temporary fix. I use an iPhone 6, so it's possible it's some user-end issues, but please look into this and see if there's something you can do or if I can see what's messing with it on my end. The app is otherwise excellent, this is the main bug I've been having."	positive
543	985746746	social	5	So, the app overall is really good! And I definitely recommend it as long as you associate with the right people. Most people on discord are rude, mean and just terrible. But there‚Äôs a mix of just about everyone on discord and that comes in handy when you‚Äôre looking for friends. But, the notifications don‚Äôt work for me. And it‚Äôs not just me! It‚Äôs also my friends on there too, either it be direct messages or even server messages. I‚Äôve went to settings and enabled the notifications many times but no matter what I do they just don‚Äôt work. So in the next update I‚Äôm hoping to see an improvement on that if it‚Äôs possible for, also I‚Äôd also like a way to delete the chat and have it deleted for good! Usually when you close a dm the messages stay there, but I‚Äôm also hoping for a way to delete it for good. I bet many people are looking for the same things in discord as I am, so please reply to let me know what could and can‚Äôt be done?	positive
544	985746746	social	2	"Discord has the potential to be a wonderful and inclusive networking tool for everyone, but unfortunately they have been ignoring a large part of their potential user base by not implementing basic accessibility measures. They are neglecting basic application decency that their competitors have already stepped up with. Discord has been saying for many years that they care about screen reader accessibility, for example, but they have done next to nothing to make sure that blind people using these softwares are able to effectively join their conmunities like anyone else would. I'm sure it's a great program, so I hear from my friends using it, but until they catch up with the times and make it so I can navigate with VoiceOver at least, only two stars here.

Regarding your response:
I don't think your team understands that you're asking us to submit feedback for an unusable system on that very system. Many people can't access that server, and the few blind folks who told me they could said it was by luck or coincidence.
You're telling us we can have a key to the house, but it's currently locked inside."	positive
545	985746746	social	3	"The discord app had worked almost seamlessly in the past in the two years that I had used it, but with the new updates (the ones that coincided with the ""new fresh look"" of the message bar), the keyboard has been having very suboptimal performance, to the point where it interferes with my ability to use it so much that I decided to write a review to make this problem known. I've never had issues such as this one in other iOS apps. 

What happens is that I will sometimes type a message and it will jump to the middle of an already typed word and type in the middle of that. At other times, autocorrect will refuse to work, and when I type on messages to edit them, they will be fixed in the message bar but will send with the original typo. Sometimes, I have sent a message, and while it does send, the whole message will still remain in the message bar where I had typed it, making me clear it manually. 

Overall, my discord experience has been good across all platforms, but I do hope a fix for this is issued soon."	positive
546	985746746	social	3	"I have Nitro supported Discord since the beginning. I love everything about it. Usually the updates are great and if they have problems they get resolved quickly. I was hoping this call display update would be improved somehow. The call acts like a real call on iOS and it‚Äôs really annoying. The status bar at the top of the home screen, the full screen display when the phone is locked, etc. When my phone is locked, I have to press the home button 3 times rather than once with finger print. First time wakes up the phone, second clears the call screen to my lock screen, third to get to the home screen. Second of all, every. single. call. shows up on the recent calls list. If you disconnect the call and start it again it shows up as a new call in the list. My recent calls is more discord than actual calls. 

This feature would cause me to uninstall any other app. An app needs to stay inside the app, not take over the rest of my phone. If other people like this feature, maybe make it an optional setting."	positive
547	985746746	social	4	"Now I‚Äôm gonna give this 4 stars because I used discord for quite awhile and I love this app but the recently the API has been very glitchy and the new update didn‚Äôt help for me. My biggest complaint is that the phone calls now save to an actual phone log when you call someone....really? You had to add that. Just why? Now I‚Äôm uncomfortable using the app because I don‚Äôt know if the app is going to get inside my phone and monitor my information and monitor all of my contacts outside of discord so I had to uninstall and write this review :/
I also don‚Äôt feel comfortable if it gets saved to a phone log that the phone company can now see  who I‚Äôm calling on discord.(cause monitoring everyone these days is out of control). So I don‚Äôt feel comfortable using the call feature on discord because now my phone company has to see me calling a friend on discord. Everyone has a right to privacy and this app just doesn‚Äôt seem private at all anymore and just gives info out like candy"	positive
548	985746746	social	3	"Since Discord Mobile has been updated several times, I‚Äôve decided to return to this review and check out what has improved the most.
In my last review, I complained about the rediculously slow loading times. That has seemed to have been almost completely eliminated, which is probably the most positive change. And that‚Äôs really about all the good changes that have happened. Some minor complaints I have on the mobile port is the fact the app seems to not be as up-to-date to the PC version of the application. Most of the other complaints in my past review still remain unchanged. For example: All users are able to post whatever they want without the worry of a filter (unless a bot is set up in the server.) I‚Äôm still shocked by the fact that NSFW channels are able to be created on Discord when the app is rated 12+.

Most of the updates were mostly major bug-fixes. But at least the program is much more usable. All what I could really do is give the app another star for is efforts on keeping the app bug-free as possible."	neutral
549	985746746	social	4	Hi! I know you won‚Äôt have much time to read this but I will really appreciate it if you do. First of all, this is a great app! There are so many things that I like. For example, you can make your own name and it will always be free to use! This is also a way to talk to all of your friends, make new friends and talk about your favorite things (gaming)! But to make this an even better app, I would personally recommend a few new features that I think everyone will enjoy! I think that there should be a feature that says when the person that you were talking to was last online. This can be used as a safety feature as well as a feature to see what‚Äôs going on because it can say if someone went missing when they were last seen or talked to. I would also recommend that you can tell when someone has read the message. And it‚Äôs for the same reasons as the other new feature. This is what I hope you can add to discord to make it a better app!	positive
550	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	"I‚Äôm not one to write these long paragraphs for reviews or even write reviews at all but honestly this is probably one of the best apps I have that helps me cope with my anxiety and also express the good things happening to me at the end of everyday

Here‚Äôs something to improve on. I feel like if you complete all the achievements which shows lots of dedication you should be able to unlock at least some of the premium features for free because it shows developers that you have spent lots of time on their app doing what you are doing for free. Now I‚Äôd you buy the membership it‚Äôs a different story but for the people who can‚Äôt really afford it even though it‚Äôs cheap or the people who are too young and need parents permission which isn‚Äôt being granted to them it would give these people 1. a good reason to keep using your app and 2. Be able to unlock features that they can‚Äôt buy. I am one of the people who can‚Äôt get the membership so I‚Äôm just writing and I haven‚Äôt even had this for a week so I can‚Äôt see my stats yet but either than that it‚Äôs overall a really awesome app.

It‚Äôs nice to come home from a stressful day of school and just sit on my phone and write what happens during the day. It‚Äôs also great that unlike other apps it doesn‚Äôt force you to remember everything that happened to you that day. With Reflectly you can focus on either the whole day or just a small portion of your day that either made it bad or good."	positive
551	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôm not gonna lie, from my personal background, I used to think these kind of mental health apps were a scam. I haven‚Äôt been feeling like myself lately and found this app on Instagram and I have been going for about two weeks strong writing every day, and this is the best thing that has ever happened to me! I have been feeling so clear minded, and have been super honest and I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Some parts are not available if you don‚Äôt have a membership, but even the free version allows a lot of access to the main features. I just purchased the membership, and with a year plan I‚Äôm literally only paying 3.33 a month, which is pretty cheap for my mental sanity. I like the questions about myself where I can reminisce on experiences from way way back, and am so happy I have found this app. If you need an outlet of any sort and semi-enjoy writing out your emotions, this app is for you. Thank you to whoever made this because every day I feel it helping me become a better person. You can even add pictures and stuff to help you remember specific events for when you look back on your entries, which I think is super dope. I highly recommend it to everyone, but suggest you try it out for free first and see what I mean. After like 7 entries, it even shows you data on how you been feeling on a day to day. This app is great and I plan to use it for a long time.	positive
552	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	"First of all, if you don‚Äôt want to read the whole review and you want a shorter summary, skip to the star emoji thing.
Honestly, this is amazing. I was scrolling through ig and I saw an ad for the app, and I said ‚ÄúWhy not? It looks cool‚Äù and I was right. The app is so helpful and calming and helps me rethink my thoughts and actions at the end of every day. Also, I love the pictures that they automatically put on your stories, they‚Äôre so pretty. I like how they have achievements for you to earn to keep you motivated. I also enjoy the questions of the day, they help me think deeper abt things. This app helps me have better days because I am thinking about WHY I had a bad day and how I can improve it. I also like the way they send nice little notifications reminding u to make a story for the day. Currently, the corona virus is going around and it‚Äôs tough for everyone, and my English teacher is trying to encourage us to keep a journal on how things are going for us because school is cancelled for three weeks. Keeping a journal does help, and it‚Äôs nice to have so I can look back at them and see how this virus is affecting me and my situation at home.    ‚òÜ Overall, the app is so helpful and I recommend it to anyone, no matter your situation at the moment, because sometimes, anyone would need to reflect on there day, and I‚Äôm so glad I can do that with Reflectly. I hope this review was helpful."	positive
553	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	"Ok I didn‚Äôt realize my free trial was over but that was my fault.  I forgot I already tried this app months ago and reopened it.  At first I regretted it because I already have another journal app but oh well.  This is a very good app. It‚Äôs simple and an excellent guide to life‚Äôs daily topics (work, relationship, travel).  The app doesn‚Äôt bring the user to a separate page per selected topic; it puts you back on the same page you‚Äôre working on in order to complete your day‚Äôs story - that‚Äôs brilliant and very considerate.  This app is not complicated and it does what it‚Äôs supposed to do - encourage the user to write about life.  No distracting forced cute illustrations or pastel soft colors.  The design and guided steps keep the user focused on writing.

It‚Äôs unbelievable how some users are so surprised when they automatically get charged after the trial period. Reading the clear print when agreeing to the trial is encouraged. Also, $40 a year is a really good deal! I read most of the comments and many wants a life-changing, super app but doesn‚Äôt want to pay for it.  The good people who are running this app - this is their source of income just like we go to work and get paid.  Let us be grateful instead or opt for a wire notebook and pencil from the Dollar Tree.  A free and amazing app - yeah, not happening.

I promise you, THIS IS AN OUTSTANDING JOURNAL APP.  My only question is, what the heck is that logo character?"	positive
554	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	"Overall, Reflectly is great app!! I really get to know myself better. Sometimes I don‚Äôt like speaking to people about my problems, so this app is PERFECT!! I don‚Äôt know why, but I feel more collected, calm, and less easily be irritate after I use this app in the morning. I‚Äôm just less likely to blow up and scream after my sister doesn‚Äôt give me my space and thinks she is the boss of everyone and everything!! This is app is so awesome!! ‚ô° ‚ô° ‚ô° ‚ô° ‚ô° ‚ô° 
  Every great app always has multiple minor flaws. Reflectly only has 1 minor flaw: There price of the special membership. It‚Äôs Special 
membership price is about $80 a year. That‚Äôs a bit much. The thing says that it will help you become happier when Reflectly helps you solve your problems. I think you should get that no matter what! That isn‚Äôt a reason to pay that much a year. I‚Äôm not trying to hate on this app. It‚Äôs a great app!! I love it! I just mean Reflectly shouldn‚Äôt have the price of a special membership be so high! Some people have many problems and don‚Äôt know how to fix them. Those type of people need Reflectly to help them with those problems without paying $80!! This is a great app anyways! I think if you maybe take the price away, it‚Äôll be the BEST app that you can have. What‚Äôs not to like; you get to know yourself better, not get irritated easily, and most importantly, BE YOURSELF!!"	positive
555	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	"I love this app because it‚Äôs very straight forward and minimally functional. Some apps try too hard to make you write or log every little emotion you were feeling throughout the day and it makes you stressed and anxious to try and thing back to these feelings you forgot you were feeling that day. I don‚Äôt write everyday which is normal for me but I feel like this app reminds me to write at the perfect times, when I‚Äôm not busy and have a little bit of downtime to type out how my day was. 

The only thing that I am still having trouble understanding is the rating spread. I understand the whole idea of it, and think it‚Äôs a good one, just needs a little more information or maybe a nice info graphic on how to enhance your mood when you‚Äôre feeling down or ways to relieve anger or stressful or anxious feelings based on what you wrote that day. If you wrote that you had a great day and everything was perfect maybe incorporate that with relatable quotes or articles on how to keep your motivation up and what you can do to do so in your work and personal life. I don‚Äôt know, this is just little things I would enjoy so maybe other people would too but I do love this app it‚Äôs relaxing and helps you get out the emotions you need in a way that doesn‚Äôt take up too much time yet lets you reflect on the important parts of your day."	positive
556	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	"I was feeling kinda down for a while, and when I started scrolling through apps, an app of the day was Reflectly. It looked cute so I tapped on it. I saw it had things to motivate your day and bring out the best in you. The challenges, questions, and goals help you rejuvenate happiness. So click I went and now I have the app. This reflection is recent, I have not even had the app for a day. But it‚Äôs friendly smiles and quotes to brighten your day help a lot. Reflectly is a self - journal to reflect your days. It‚Äôs probably described as a diary, but it is so much more. The app is very well
designed too. The graphics, characters, words, and more are smoothly operated by the creators. I feel really confident that I am going to be a lot more happy in the future. Conflicts and glitches aren‚Äôt a problem yet, as apprised to other reviews here. You may be wondering why I have four stars. It‚Äôs because I am a beginner. I haven‚Äôt unlocked all if the tools involved in the Reflectly. It has shown me what to do, but it does let you explore the world of the app. Reluctantly I like this app, and if your dealing with something you‚Äôd rather not share with other people, this is the app for you. I will update if I change something about my vote. But again, the app was a generally a good start. I can already fell my stress bleeding right out of me. So now, get Reflectly, it‚Äôs a great start!"	positive
557	1241229134	health_and_fitness	3	"Ok so I really love this app, it‚Äôs really nice and aesthetic. It‚Äôs so fun to write your whole day down. What your mood was, the things you did today, and then you can look back at all those stories. Which is a lot of fun and very relaxing. 
I do have a couple of problems though. So I was browsing and I accidentally hit the log out button. Obviously you can log back in, but when I logged back on everything was gone. I was literally going to cry. The whole thing was gone, it said I had no stories or streaks or anything. I was able to download my data and get it sent to my email, but I then had to rewrite everything. Which I was willing to do. I started writing one then went to bed. I woke up and looked at it and it was still gone. The poof it‚Äôs all back, I don‚Äôt know how but it was all back there. Ok my next problem. I do love Reflectly but to only be able to do one thing in not premium is annoying. So basically you have to enter 7 stories and you unlock your status. Then I‚Äôm going to look at my status and it says you have to have premium. I will pay for premium but I don‚Äôt want to, I‚Äôm going to save up my money. I read this in one review and I thought it was a good idea. You could complete like a certain amount of stories to unlock let‚Äôs say status. Actually unlock it though, be able to look at it and everything. So personally if this was my game I would do this. Thank you."	positive

I know I know I‚Äôm going to crazy, it‚Äôs just I love this app so much that I wanna write again when I was 4 years old I used to write a lot, but when I turned 8 years old I started stopping to write... but now since I‚Äôm 20 I wanna write again! I know it sound weird because I‚Äôm 20 years old again so i wanna write again!This app is amazing I want updates also! I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs a little update or a big update but..I like it the way it is it‚Äôs beautiful üòç I hope you feel good, this is a quote I made ‚Äúwhenever you see a flower blooming it makes you bloom and grow!‚Äù Yes I know it‚Äôs kinda weird but it‚Äôs true!

559	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôve never really been one to write reviews before - must be because I really love this app. But this has changed the game for me in being able to reflect on my day and journal! I‚Äôve journaled in notebooks before but was never really consistent with it. But this has helped increase my consistency, ease of journaling, my ‚Äúwant‚Äù to journal, and include more details of my day - like being able to upload photos of it. I like how it asks questions to make me thing and reflect, although I don‚Äôt find all the questions worth answering, I definitely do like when I see a good question that helps me reflect! The only things I wish that were improved on this would be increasing how much you can type per section, having something to save all this data to, and idk if it‚Äôs desktop friendly, but if it‚Äôs not, then being able to use on a laptop/computer as well. But overall, I love this app and how convenient it is to journal. The hassle with journaling is being able to capture your thoughts and ideas at any given moment, meaning - having something to write on and write with. But the convenience of having this app on your phone to journal whenever really helps to simplify things and journal whenever you want	positive
560	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôm not usually a sappy‚Äìwanna write in a journal about my life kind of person, and when I saw this app on an instagram ad I was a bit skeptical, but lately I‚Äôve been going through a lot and I‚Äôm trying to come to terms with my emotions. I‚Äôve tried many ‚Äúlog your day‚Äù types of apps.. and none of them have been as good as this one. It‚Äôs very calming, easy to use, straight forward, and efficient. I think the idea behind this app is awesome and it‚Äôs been executed very well. This has easily made its way to one of my favorite apps in such a short amount of time. I‚Äôve already suggested it to my friends and I personally just think it‚Äôs perfect for someone like me.. someone who‚Äôs going through a bit of a rough time and just needs a place to vent. The app is already wonderful how it is, but of course ideally to me it could maybe have a section for something like breathing exercises, or a way to calm you down. I personally have a lot of anxiety and so I feel that would be very, very helpful. Even maybe some calming sounds, or videos. Just a suggestion of course! It‚Äôs still amazing how it is. I thank the people who made this app. I never knew I could care so deeply about a small little Icon on my phone. Thank you Reflectly team.	positive
561	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	I really love it . However , I‚Äôm giving it four stars . Overall it is a very good app that I will be looking forward to using in the future . Now you are probably wondering why I give it four stars , it‚Äôs because of the price . While yes , the price of the app use is free , you are very limited to what you can do . If you are looking to just vent into a virtual journal , then look no further , this IS the app for you . But ... if you‚Äôre like me and want to take it further by taking photos and seeing progress ( like streaks and daily moods ) then you will have to buy it to access it . A premium account would be better for you if you want to go out and explore photos , get personal insights and more . The app , although , is still amazing , no glitches (yet , don‚Äôt count me on it ) and runs very smoothly . If you haven‚Äôt seen an ad on this , it‚Äôs basically an online personal diary where you can tell about your day and describe it by clicking what made it the way you feel about it  ( such as food , travel, relationships etc. ) and your emotion( confused , happy , anxious ) . You can customize the screen and add onto the way your day was . I really like that and it‚Äôs a good app worth the try . üòä I‚Äôll update if something happens or whatever.	positive
562	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	If you can remember to do this and have the effort to try and make a daily story, this is perfect for you if you need to relieve stress, and feel more productive! This is why i turn on notifications, make sure to do that. I honestly love it, but you could add a few things. 1: be able to share your thoughts and get feedback from other people who are going through the same thing. I find that satisfying that if i am going through a rough time, i am not alone. This is not just for stress, depression, and anxiety. This just could be used to pull yourself together, be more organized, and overall a nice experience. 2: have a schedule. I think it would be nice to have a calendar, and you could tap a date, and add something you have to do on that day. (Also used if you have notifications on) sure, we could download a separate calendar app, but this would get much more downloads if you have it all in one. 3: a ‚Äúdiary‚Äù would help feel more fresh and like wight being lifted off your chest. I personally, like digital diaries, because they are easier and my hand doesn't get tired üòÇ Im sorry if any of these were already included, but these are some of my ideas!	positive
563	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	I absolutely love reflectly! BUT... there is one thing. The only thing I am a bit dissatisfied with is the lack of options that the people who do not want to pay a subscription for the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù. (Keep in mind that the subscription is QUITE a bit of money!) So reflectly, I would really appreciate it if you guys could add some more options for the people who don‚Äôt want to pay the monthly subscription. Other than that, I would love to elaborate on how much I LOVE LOVE LOVE this app! First of all, this app helps so much with daily check ins (if that makes any sense) on how the users of this app days are going, and the way that this app doesn‚Äôt just leave us all struggling (this is me) to search our mind of what to write about the day we had‚Äî it gives us good and realistic questions to answer. I also must add that the feature of adding pictures to the journals is amazing because you never know when one of us users may want to sneak in a pic of a nice day at the beach, cool food etc. overall, I love this app and am looking forward to the future updates. Thank you for taking this time to read this rewiew!!! üëå‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅ truly pleased‚Äî these 5 golden stars are all shining bright and true!!!	positive
564	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	"This app is so enjoyable! Logging at rating my days makes me want to do more with my time so I can look back on my happiest moments, and the different questions asked each day is such a wholesome way to finish my day-to-day experience. I look forward to recording what antics I‚Äôd encountered at the end of the day, and having a visible streak pushes me even harder! I especially love how I can attach pictures to my day; there‚Äôs now a visual aid to help remind me of a particular moment. It makes me want to take more pictures of whatever enticing activities I come across! 

The only reason I am not giving this app five stars is because of the intense lack of content for non-premium users. If I had the money, I would love to pay for my statistics and bonus features! Having those extra tidbits would greatly influence my experience on the app. Unfortunately, I do not have the money, and at stones the app seems to be punishing me for it. It‚Äôs rather annoying to be constantly bugged with ‚Äúso you want to upgrade?‚Äù notifications, especially when the exit button is so expertly hidden that I have to close the app entirely.

Overall, Reflectly is a wonderfully charming and entertaining app! I rate this four golden stars and a wholesome kiss on the cheek. ;)"	positive
565	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	I really like using the app, but a lot of the features advertised on their apple store page aren‚Äôt available unless you go premium. I thought it was weird, but I didn‚Äôt look at their page too hard, so I didn‚Äôt mind it. I love the way the typing feels so easy and the atmosphere the app sets is nice. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm safe when I‚Äôm writing it, like I‚Äôm talking to a therapist or writing a sick novel. I was put off by the missing feature, which was being able to track your progress in happiness, but I don‚Äôt mind it because I‚Äôm not the only one using the app on my phone. However, I don‚Äôt like the fact that you can only write one story for every day because sometimes I want to write other things, an entirely different story, but I can‚Äôt, which is ok. I‚Äôm fine with it since it makes the app feel much more natural, but it would be nice if you opened a specific day on the calendar in the app and you could choose which story to go over, but, again, I don‚Äôt mind it. (Also it‚Äôs cheap that you count spaces as a character since you‚Äôre making it limited for people who won‚Äôt or can‚Äôt pay.) Great app, nonetheless, would recommend to my friends if it didn‚Äôt make me uncomfortable to tell them I use an app diary.	positive
566	1241229134	health_and_fitness	3	When I first downloaded this app back in 2017, I really liked it because of the access to everything and the way I was able to express things without anything holding me back. Some apps similar to this require you have a subscription in order to access everything, and those always bothered me. Because I wasn't using this app as much as I could have, I deleted it and recently just re-downloaded because I felt as though I needed it more than ever. I was very bothered to find that a lot of the features that were free back when I had it two years ago are no longer available unless I have a subscription. This means I can't express my own emotions in a manner that I should be because the app wants me to pay 40$ a year in order for me to do so. As a student in university, I need something like this to help me sort through my depression and anxiety, and I don't have the money to pay yearly for a subscription to an app that I used to love. I believe that if some of the subscription services were taken away, such as the stats for my mood and the unlimited space for journal entries, this could be better, but the fact that the subscription takes nearly everything away from the user is something that I strongly dislike.	positive
567	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	I have been loving the app. It‚Äôs been helping me a lot and I love journaling but just never feel like writing on paper. So this was the perfect app to get me in the habit of reflecting on my day without getting discouraged by writing in paper. However, I am giving 4 stars because lately, when I go in to add a story, knowing that I am connected to WiFi because other WiFi required apps work, when I try to click let‚Äôs go when adding the story, I get the same message telling me that something went wrong because of an internet connection problem. So I will check with google and other apps that need WiFi and they load just fine. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the actual app or just my iPhone that‚Äôs crashing. I never write reviews but thought that if you (the app developers) saw this, you might be able to try and fix it, if it is the app. But because of this issue I haven‚Äôt been able to add stories for the past couple nights. Even my morning moment are not loading the actual text. Just the headings. Anyways, I hope this can be fixed if it is a glitch in the app, but seeing other reviews it doesn‚Äôt look like anyone else is having this problem.	positive
568	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	The positive quotes are great and you can add a little bit of info about the things you did that day, or a lot. It‚Äôs really up to you! Every morning they give you a positive quote and a challenge. My daily challenge was to go on a run and see the world. I definitely think Reflectly is an amazing app and you should download it. Even if you don‚Äôt feel like the app is for you, I think everyone needs a challenge and some motivation in their life! You don‚Äôt have to fill out the surveys, but the morning challenges and motivation are they for you in case your having a bad day. The ‚Äúmorning‚Äù card that pops up with the challenge and motivation and stays there all day. Meaning you have access to it all day long. So at some point during the day if your not feeling good about yourself or something or someone else, go onto the Reflectly app and take a look at the quote or challenge and try your best to push your limits and complete the challenges. That‚Äôs about all I have to say about this app so now, you better go download it!!ü§£ Have fun on Reflectly and always express your feelings when needed, or don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs up to you!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèºüëçüèº	positive
569	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	Reflectly has changed a lot for me not just the way I think mentally but physically it reminds me every day that I could be going through something worse that someone else could be suffering while I am here hating my life but living living a life that someone else would dream to have someone on the street would love would be grateful for, And as I say these words I am reflecting on my past self on how ungrateful and selfish I was so I‚Äôm saying thank you so much for helping me realize the pain that other people could be going through so that I can enjoy my life and be as great full as I can while I can because sometimes people don‚Äôt always get a good life some people don‚Äôt always get things like this some people don‚Äôt get gifts that make them special or that can give them money and honestly right now I am so grateful for what I have my past life I was suffering I had a really really bad past that I don‚Äôt think many people know about so I‚Äôm reflecting on my past self and I am thanking the lord that I could have this life and not be selfish anymore and I thank you God for this life that I‚Äôm given.	positive
570	1241229134	health_and_fitness	3	I just downloaded this app, and while it has a beautiful layout, there are times where it has its short comings. Firstly, there needs more be more versatility with things like activities and moods, because each day there are more things that affect you and just one entry is a little nerve wracking. Second, I have a premium account right off the bat (plus the trial) but what struck me as odd is that I have to PAY to document my emotions or daily events on this app‚Äîwhen in reality I feel like I‚Äôm only paying for it‚Äôs beautiful layout. Third, you can‚Äôt copy and paste or cut anything into your entry sections when you write. A gigantic error page pops up and that‚Äôs very frustrating and disappointing considering you‚Äôre paying for the app to function like any other maybe even better than others. This has so much potential but missing features like a monthly tracker to document your moods, multiple emotion options/activities to choose from when doing entries and trackers that monitor how often you feel a mood or how often you do an activity is really depressing. It needs more and that‚Äôs what I was expecting considering some people might actually pay nearly 45 a year to keep it running.	negative
571	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	"Reflectly does exactly what it says, creating an easy and effective platform to job notes about your day. While similar to the notepad function, it offers a bit more with interactive elementals like describing mood, asking daily questions, etc.

Where this app has a problem (it seems like a bug) is when you try to edit something you said, it often freezes and you have to go back to the top of the page, close your keyboard and then go back. This is a really frustrating issue (happening as if patch 2.8.4.). When this happens it makes me just want to use the notepad function, because it feels choppy and rough. I also don‚Äôt like how you can‚Äôt paste text into your descriptions. It makes transferring things from my notepad really frustrating and hard.

Other than this bug, I find Reflectly to do exactly what is says, and guides you through your thoughts. While you could just use a notepad, the features are a nice addition for staying on track and engaging thought. Hopefully they‚Äôll fix the above-stated issue and improve fluidity is the app."	positive
572	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	"I know I rated it five stars but Im just upset because first off, I‚Äôm 13 and don‚Äôt have a credit card so I can‚Äôt subscribe to a priemium
Account. I‚Äôm in seventh grade and I have a lot of work and homework. It‚Äôs giving a lot of stress and Recently I lost a couple friends and on top of that, I‚Äôm not doing so well in school. Also my dad isn‚Äôt very close to me. All these things are making me feel not myself. Some nights I can‚Äôt sleep I‚Äôm so sad.
Anyway enough about my life. I‚Äôm pretty sure this app would‚Äôve helped me but like I said, I don‚Äôt have a credit card so I can‚Äôt really do anything. That‚Äôs why I rated it five stars because this app looked helpful. Anyway I know the priemum membership is the way the app developers make money and I understand that. But maybe you could put some ads in there and take away some payments that would be fantastic. But if you can‚Äôt I completely understand that that‚Äôs how 
You make money (the app developers). 
I totally recommend this app for people who are sad and can afford 40 bucks a month."	positive
573	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	"I‚Äôve never been persevering when it comes to jounaling; I almost always end up ditching the app I‚Äôm using and find a new one. But Reflectly somehow keeps me hooked on writing stories, adding images (or just admiring the beautiful ones that go automatically with every story), and reflecting on my day. Overall it is a great app. But it could use a number of improvements.
Firstly, the twelve hundred character limit has proven quite short for me on some days where I‚Äôve wanted to delve a bit more into my thoughts and feelings. Furthermore, the constant Internet connection needed to use the app seems a bit far-fetched; I think it can‚Äôt be that hard to make this app work offline. Also, when it comes to choosing the mood of your day, being able to choose more than one (or simply to write your own in more than the one word allowed) would be a very welcome improvement. And, finally, some more options for the AI questions would do no harm‚ò∫Ô∏è. 
The app in itself is truly amazing, and adding requests like this into it I believe would make for an even better experience!"	positive
574	1241229134	health_and_fitness	1	"I receive an error while saving rather frequently. I‚Äôd say at least once a week. When that happens, there is no way to recover. I have to manually go thru the story and copy my entry so that I won‚Äôt lose it... not to mention, text selection is garbage so trying to get the ‚ÄúSelect All‚Äù text hover button to appear is hit or miss. Why is there no way to ‚ÄúSave as Draft‚Äù or some other method of error reporting? What is the error? Also, why is an internet connection required for journal entry? I understand backups of the entries require internet, but why does actually creating a new journal entry require internet? 

Overall, I regret spending a yearly membership on this app. I have removed my subscription. Will continue to use for the remainder of my subscription, but then will switch apps completely unless things change. 

Fantastic concept, love the prompts. Minor tweaks like being able to select multiple icons when choosing what made the day good or bad would be nice (although you can select multiple if you edit the story, weird workaround) and adding multiple pictures would be nice. I really do like the concept, this is the journaling app I‚Äôve been looking for. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs just very buggy and requires internet for no good reason."	positive
575	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	"I like using the app, it‚Äôs a beautiful interface. It always runs great. But I wish there was more to it. Yes, it helps me reflect on my day, get out my feelings without having to have a heart to heart conversation with someone. But having the premium version of the app, I expected more.
I wish the developers would add the option to reflect on more than one category. ‚ÄúWork, relationship, school, food, exercise, etc.‚Äù Why wouldn‚Äôt I want to speak on more than one category?
I also expected a more personalized approach. Give me more places to type in my goals, habits, something else. I can spend less than 5 minutes on the app a day and feel like I didn‚Äôt do anything to better myself. 
I would also like daily questions that seem of some significance. They always seem random, and at the end of a bay day the last thing I want to do is talk about what i think is most important in a friend.
I challenge the developers to dive deeper into their customers and explore a more personal connection with the app other than. ‚ÄúHow was your day? Bad? Sorry, Good job!‚Äù"	positive
576	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	"It's alright, I've liked it so far though I've only been using the free version. I wish there were more options in between some things. Like for ""completely okay"" and ""somewhat bad"" I wish there was a neutral option in between. It just feels like such a large gap you know? Like my day was just fine over all but wasn't completely okay but doesn't really qualify for somewhat bad either type of thing, you know? Like just an option that says ""fine"" or ""neutral"" or something. And also for the selection of how you felt during the day I wish there was a neutral option for that too. I'm not always feeling happy or anxious or stressed, sometimes I just kinda exist and don't feel a certain way. A ""fine"" option would be great to have here as well. 
I don't know what all is in the premium version so I guess it's possible these things are there?? But yeah over all from what I've experienced I've liked what I've seen in the free version so far but it's not something I would buy for a lot of money or pay a subscription for."	positive
577	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	Hi, so I just downloaded Reflectly yesterday. This app is amazing if you want to express you feelings. I think the little face is super cute! It‚Äôs a nice touch. Anyway, so I‚Äôm going to tell you what your going to see if you download this app. First you meet Reflectly and he shows you the ropes. You can rate your day how good or bad it was. Next, you get to write all about your day and what happened that made it so amazing or horrible. After that, you get a question of the day. It could be anything. My first one was, ‚ÄúWhat was the most embarrassing moment you ever had?‚Äù Then it gives you space to answer. That‚Äôs just the writing portion of the app. Next you get ‚Äúpersonal stats‚Äù which you have to pay for with premium. I can‚Äôt really say anything about premium, because I don‚Äôt have it, but I think this app is definitely worth trying! Please try it and tell your friends. It really just helps me when I want to tell someone what‚Äôs going on. Thanks for reading! Have a good day and go purchase this app!	positive
578	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	"This is an amazing app. It‚Äôs simple in that it‚Äôs not some crazy intricate journal. It‚Äôs an all that helps you really reflect and record you and your life. I really love how the app is designed (it‚Äôs extremely aesthetically pleasing) and it‚Äôs really easy to use. Normally I‚Äôm not a big journal either but this makes it so easy and attainable that I haven‚Äôt missed a day in the last 3 weeks of using it. Also the customer support is very patient and helpful. I lost my account for a few days and they were able to track it down. Only thing I‚Äôd suggesting fixing is to make it able to change your email after your first set up. I mistyped mine (which caused the whole ‚Äúlosing it‚Äù incident) and I cant change it. Although the oerson who helped me get my account back assured me it would come in the next update. Overall an amazing app!!

Also something I‚Äôd like to add is that I think the word count for each story should be higher as I often run out of characters and have to shorten my story...."	positive
579	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	I really like this app because it makes me feel better when I write stuff down and I don‚Äôt like to do that on papers because it gets lost or someone can read the papers and know what I am feeling when it‚Äôs none of there business. I bottle up my emotions and having daily questions and being able to tell this app why today was a good day or not because at home I don‚Äôt have someone that will just listen to me talk and rant without them putting there opinions in. But I don‚Äôt want there opinions I just need to get stuff off my chest and talk but no one will listenüòï. So it makes me feel a little better ig that I can write down my stuff on this app. I heard of this app from Snapchat. And I‚Äôm glad I did I really like this app and I hope u do too if u download it. The only part I do t like is for the best experience u have to get premium and my family doesn‚Äôt have enough money for that. So I don‚Äôt like that but so far I really do like it and would choose this over notes I think.	positive
580	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	This app is stunning I would like some additional improvements though like in a particular story you can have times of when events happened Like let‚Äôs say in the morning I ate blabla bla and when you click return two times, it puts in the date of the time currently or you can press it to change the time of when this event happened. I feel like it will organize the events of the day easier. And I don‚Äôt know if this is already a feature but if not then, for the daily challenges, at the end of the day there should be a notification asking wether or not you completed the daily challenge. And if yes write what you did and if no write how come. Also when you choose how you felt today I was hoping you can pick like two for instance, let‚Äôs say today was nice because of friends and family. Currently you can only do one and I hope you can pick the major reason and then a minor reason why your day was good/bad.	positive
581	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	Just downloaded this app this month when I saw this app on an add. I decided to try it out. Well...... How did it turn out? VERY AWSOME!!! It‚Äôs because I get to spend my time reading all the memories that I will still remember. You get to add photos from places to visit. And when you are still editing your story, the app asks you a question and asks if you want to answer it. Also people won‚Äôt see your journal, so you have your own privacy! The only thing that is on the negative side is that you need membership to have..... unlimited stories in your journal, track your progress, get a morning moment, and have a passcode for your journal. I really don‚Äôt like this at all..... I have SO MANY MEMORIES TO WRITE INTO!!!!üòíüòíüòíüòí But That‚Äôs Okay, developer(s.), I know you did A LOT OF WORK doing this. I don‚Äôt mind. So I will still rate this a five. But for all you guys who want to try out, I‚Äôm just giving you a heads up, you should look out for!üòä Just keep doing the great work Reflectly!üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ	positive
582	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	The app is good but I find it a little irritating how in the morning like 30 minutes after I‚Äôve woken up it‚Äôs asking ‚ÄúHow was your day?‚Äù when really nothing has happened. Also, when it asks what made your day turn out however it did like if it was completely ok, and it gives options like ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù or ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù it would be nice to be able to pick more than one, because it‚Äôs not always one thing that has caused me to feel a certain thing or my day to go a certain way. It would also be nice if before it moves on to the next section of choices/writing it would have ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button or something instead of automatically moving on to the next section. Like at the beginning when it asks how your day went and you can choose ‚ÄúCompletely okay‚Äù or ‚ÄúSomewhat bad‚Äù and like the second you move the circle thing it just moves to the next section, before you can even read what you picked and before you can see what your options are. Other than those things the app is nice	positive
583	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	"I deal with a lot of anxiety and depression, i‚Äôve always wanted to write down my days thinking it may help but felt it was weird. This kind of does that for you and seamlessly as well, with the option of writing down notes yourself too if you felt like it. My only issue is the subscription base. I dislike subscriptions with a passion and hoped there was a lifetime option but i‚Äôll continue on the free trial to see how it goes, if it it‚Äôs $39 yearly, just seems excessive in my opinion still.

update: Through looking at other free alternatives there really isn‚Äôt one that‚Äôs comparable and others are more expensive. I just really have no experience with subscriptions from an app in general so I was only being harsh based off that. This seems to be the cheapest alternative while i‚Äôm no journal expert this is great for people that seem to just want to express how their day went without writing it down, best part is if you do want to write it down there‚Äôs that option too lol. Best of both worlds."	positive
584	1241229134	health_and_fitness	1	"EDIT: I changed my review from 4 stars to 1 star. I‚Äôm really disappointed that the creators of this app have decided to charge its users a premium membership to even use the app. I first started using Reflectly in May 2018 and loved it when it was free. I understand needing the revenue to survive as a company, but along with a premium version there should still be a usable ‚Äúfree version‚Äù just with less features available. I can‚Äôt even type out a decent thought with the current character limit. The monthly rate to use this app is not worth it. The only reason I‚Äôm keeping it is because I have over 100 entries and don‚Äôt want to lose them.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I really enjoy this app and have found it incredibly helpful in practicing self- reflection and mindfulness. My suggestion to make it an even better app would be to create a way for users to more easily look back on their old entries. Right now I have to manually scroll through all my posts one by one to find an old entry. Maybe you could add a panel that shows a monthly calendar with the days hi-lighted if there was an entry written. Then, users can click on the date to see what they wrote for that specific day."	positive
585	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	I‚Äôve only had it for a little while and it‚Äôs pretty good so far. It‚Äôs quite helpful if you need like shoulder to cry on or someone to lend an ear but there is no actual person to do so. Reflectly is the thing you can go to to help you with all kinds of stress. But the reason I mark it only 4 stars is because I just think there are a few things that could be tweaked. 1: I think you a bigger writing capacity. If you have had the worst day of your life and you really need to rant about it. You don‚Äôt get that much space to do so. And sure you may think 1250 is a lot but when you are ranting a good bit, you have a bit of a problem with space. 2: there are some things that are unclear to me on here. I think you should have one of those help buttons so if you don‚Äôt understand something, you can click on it and it can explain it to you rather than having to go somewhere else to find it. For an example when it says ‚ÄúYour Daily Notes‚Äù I‚Äôm not exactly sure what I am supposed to put there.	negative
586	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	Originally I came across this app on an add and thought. ‚ÄúWow This looks kinda dumb yet fun... why not?‚Äù I got it later that day and Actually Found it nice! Something about how it‚Äôs not always the same, There is of course a routine, but At the same time Reflectly Spices things up! The questions and feeling of it really makes it Different from the rest, It‚Äôs not just a smart notebook, Over just a few weeks It feels more like a good friend that you can talk to to get Something off your chest. Now A small Downside, I didn‚Äôt like how there was A few Features left out for Subscription. I get the fact of what the developers are doing, I honestly would get it too, But I think if there were a few more features swapped around for free accounts it would make this app Even better! In some ways it‚Äôs just not fully worth it To get a few more features, But I Want to Just Thank the developers for an over all great app. Hope to see it grow!	positive
587	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	Awesome platform, I love the concept of it and have been using it for a while now. However, once you accumulate a bunch of stories, it is hard to classify them how you‚Äôd like to. You can only classify them by your favorites, which is unconventional at times. I‚Äôd love to see a feature where you can add a #word to classify any story. For example, instead of #favorites... you can make your own #word to classify. Like #january , where all the ones listed in this are written in January. Or whatever system to organize the stories, or have a calendar view of them as well as a card slide show. Also, it would be really nice to be able to scroll through word using the iPhone trackpad feature where you hold down the space bar and move through words. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not possible in this app but it is anywhere else (if you have a 6s and above I believe). Thanks I hope this gets fixed and I‚Äôm liking this app.	positive
588	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	"I‚Äôve gone through countless journal apps. None show so much care and attention to detail as Reflectly. First of all, I appreciate that we‚Äôre able to use all of the core features for free (creating stories, uploading pics, logging days). A lot of apps will limit what you can do in terms of actually journaling just so they can charge you. What I appreciate the most is the positive approach towards mental wellness. You can see how important mental health is to the developers in all areas of the app- from the way the journal prompts are worded to the gentle and smooth interface to the way the notifications are worded. This team cares about its users. Props to the Reflectly team. Awesome, refreshing approach to the world of journaling apps. 

The onlyyyyyy reason this review is missing a star is I wish there was the option of a dark/night mode for those of us with light sensitivity. I know the option to change the color theme is premium, but it would be really helpful to have a free dark option!"	positive
589	1241229134	health_and_fitness	3	I‚Äôm still in my week trial, but so far I really love the questions it asks. I can fill it out literally anywhere, even at work, because it‚Äôs on my phone. More mood choices would be good, I always want to say ‚Äúchill‚Äù. Now my problems with the app and just some glitches. I got my morning notification, so I opened the app and I realized I wanted to make an entry for yesterday. So I try to click the message at the bottom, or the X, and the screen doesn‚Äôt even seem like it‚Äôs responding to me touching the buttons. It‚Äôs like just an image. So to do my entry, I had to swipe up, kill the app, and open again. My other glitch is when I‚Äôm writing an entry, sometimes it works fine, and other times I answer and question and it doesn‚Äôt go to the next, nor can I swipe or click to the next one. So again, I need to kill the app to get it to work. I would seriously consider a subscription if this is fixed because the questions are thought provoking. Helps to access parts of your brain you don‚Äôt often go to. Really cool	positive
590	1241229134	health_and_fitness	2	"This app seems like it would be really interesting and useful to use if it would only work correctly for me. First, when I make my stories, if I don‚Äôt have time to listen to the audio I unlock then it says I can unlock it for later. But when I go to the audio messages it says I have to pay to listen to the ones I was supposed to have unlocked. It doesn‚Äôt unlock them. 
Second, my stories won‚Äôt save. I made one story and since then I‚Äôve tried to make one twice. But it the phone locks (it did the second time I tried to listen to the audio) or if the audio won‚Äôt load after you try to play it (the first time I tried to listen to one directly after unlocking it) then the story is lost. 
And maybe they aren‚Äôt that hard to remake but this is the second time it‚Äôs happened and it just makes me angry. If I‚Äôve had a bad day and make a story and it breaks, I don‚Äôt want to rewrite about all the events of the day that upset me. It‚Äôs just frustrating. The app is an amazing idea and I really want it to work for me but all it has done since I‚Äôve downloaded it is stress me out."	negative
591	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	"I look forward to using this app everyday toward the end of my day. It provides me with a somewhat different prompt each time, but always allows me to reflect upon my day. I've only been using the app for 5 days now, but i am excited to get more streak achievements as well as a good number of stories written. Once I get to seven stories written, I will have access to the ""stats"" tab. I'm not entirely sure what that is going to look like but I am nonetheless excited to find out. I would recommend this app for anyone that finds themselves wondering how they are doing as a whole... I remember a point in my life when a friend could ask me how I had been feeling the past couple days- and I wouldn't know what to tell them. I would actually forget what had happened the previous days. But now that I downloaded this app, I reflect upon my day and I could let anyone know that I've been doing just fine. A great app!"	positive
592	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	O.....M.....G I can not tell you how much I LOVE this app. It is so nice and the cute little Reflectly guy is sooo cute and sweet! Every story has a unique twist in it. Every one has a really pretty cover of nature and it‚Äôs so beautiful. This app also allows you to have a streak of how many days you come in a row, and it also has achievements so it will motivate you to go on the app. I absolutely love this app so much, absolutely everything is customizable to your own likening. And if you have a bad day, good day, or something bad happens, you can always go to Reflectly to express how you feel about it. And the own thing I love the most is it‚Äôs free! Now it dose have a membership but that‚Äôs only if you want to and that‚Äôs extra, you don‚Äôt need to do it. The app is perfect with and without it. One last thing is this relieves anxiety, depression and it gets your body in a better state of mind. I can‚Äôt say this enough I love this app so much and I highly recommended it!	positive
593	1241229134	health_and_fitness	4	"i think this app is very helpful. before i had it, i deleted it for a few reasons. but i came
back and it has improved a lot !! it was still very helpful, but i had some issues that were now fixed. i enjoy the style and navigation. this is a very therapeutic application if you need to get your feelings out, but don‚Äôt want anybody to look. maybe there should be a new category where there is an AI that asks you how you‚Äôve been and gives you help tips ? but i know that is a hard thing to do, so it is just a suggestion on maybe how to make this app more. . helpful ? but it is amazing just how it is. i love to come home and just write. especially when nobody else is around. i‚Äôm very grateful for reflectly. 

though there is a tiny problem.

i dislike how you have to pay to get daily questions, unlimited journaling, and personal insights, ect. what i do like is that you can cancel this. i normally don‚Äôt take these trails because i am afraid it will continue with the process and start to bill me. and i‚Äôm sure with the suggestion i gave is at least related with some feature in the add on. but i might actually try the trial. i‚Äôm just not sure if i will really buy the extra package. but overall i love this app. but if some of these features that you have to pay for became just in the normal version of reflectly, that would probably make more people come to it, if you know what i‚Äôm saying. 

but, bravo. this is a fantastic app !!!"	positive

The thing that concerns me obviously that concerns everyone is the price, but it‚Äôs $10 a month are you going to really complain about that? Because seeing a therapist just for one hour can cause literally a lot of money and it does not even compare to the fraction of that it‚Äôs so expensive to see a real person. This tremendously helps a lot if you need a place to vent, vent in the app and it‚Äôs still free. The premium is the cost if you want extra features but it‚Äôs not needed you can still vent. It‚Äôs honestly a great app and if you don‚Äôt want to pay $10 a month you could pay for one year which is a lot cheaper in my opinion it‚Äôs only $40 for a whole year you‚Äôre saving literally like a over $100 not including the money you‚Äôll save because therapists are so expensive nowadays	positive
595	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	"I have attempted to start journals before, but none have lasted longer than a few days. I am a regular user of this app and I write an entry daily. 
What I love about Reflectly is that it keeps me motivated to write every day. I find this app to be relaxing, and it does not put pressure on me to write out every little detail. It gives me a starting point, asking me how I felt throughout the day, and then it just lets me write.
 I especially love the question that comes after you write about your day. These questions can range from something fun, like who is your idol, to something more serious, like what means the most to you. I love these questions because they are always engaging, and they help me gain a greater insight to myself. Finally, this app allows you to create a title that pertains to your day, and then it allows you to add a picture from the day, and if you dont have a picture, it generates a calming picture of nature."	positive

I am of a young age of which I will not disclose the exact numbers, and therefore I cannot afford to go ‚ÄòPremium‚Äô in any case. Although it would help me in the scheme of grander things to be able to use it, the feature requires money 

Which

I 

Don‚Äôt 

Have.

I understand the premise of using ‚ÄòPremium‚Äô subscriptions to earn money; but in the case of apps such as this that allow people to express their feelings honestly, in my opinion, concepts tend to.. clash. It comes off as greedy in retrospect, and as well as it is for business, the company can also maintain face and earn money by other means outside of this app. 

I digress, but I have one more issue to talk about. For whatever reason or another, there is not an option to be allowed to write more than one entry for the same day, and there is a character limit of 1,250. This is a huge problem posed on writers who tend to write a bit more than the limit. Especially where in Reflectly they really get your brain working so you can write as much as possible.

As I stated in the first paragraph, I highly enjoy this app. While some features may not be free, it doesn‚Äôt pose a threat to me or my writing as I keep sailing along, cataloguing my days in peace."	positive
597	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	I think this is a good app because you can reflect back on your day before you go to bed. It helps you take away all the stress if you had a bad day or helps remind you to be grateful of the good things if you had a great day. It‚Äôs also nice to look back into the past and remember the things that happened weeks ago, months ago, etc. I honestly would recommend this to anyone feeling like they need advice or just to get things off of their mind. I also love how without paying, you can still have improvements on your mind. The creators must make money off of it, so I appreciate still being able to do a lot with this app. An idea to improve the app is to maybe change the color of your profile as the color is purple and you might want to change it. But besides that, very amazing app and a good experience I think everyone should have. You deserve my 5 stars. Thanks! üôÉ	positive
598	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	Not only is it a good app to release pressure and how you feel, you really fell great after using it. I‚Äôm not the type to usually get apps like this, and I merely saw an advertisement for it. It looked cool, so I tapped download. Little did I know how amazing this was for my social life. If certain days were uncomfortable and I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it, I can spill it all out to this app. Not only does it store information but it helped me keep track of days and how my overall week has been. It‚Äôs almost like a councilor that you usually have to pay to use, but this one is free and you keep it in your pocket. I was very skeptical at first if this was really ‚ÄúLife changing‚Äù but this turned out to actually make me feel almost instantly better. It‚Äôs great to finally get this experience thrown into a wonderful app I can use virtually anytime, anywhere. Thank you for reading, RS. üòÅ (PS, this app is totally worth it.)	positive
599	1241229134	health_and_fitness	5	"I love this app so much, and I don‚Äôt care if you have to pay for some stuff because either way I think this app is helpful, because it lets me just tell it about my day. And it feels good after just to get it all out. Like talking to someone, I like this because it asks question too! And they get more and more personalized the more you use the app! I just love it and its outstanding. But I just want it to ask some more questions but other wise I completely recommend this app to ANYONE! You don‚Äôt just have to have depression or anxiety etc, you can have none and still find this app useful! So if you see this I totally recommend that you get this app because it fantastic. Now I‚Äôm just here to say Thank You to the creators of this app. You are smart and this app is amazing I love what you have created and if you see this, Thank you this has really helped me.

600	1462082664	social	4	I have never had a problem with this app until just recently, in fact I have been in love with this ever since I gotten it. I love the idea of getting random questions, answers, an the thrill of not knowing who it is. But just recently I have been getting a glitching problem. After putting up one of these on my story I would only get one response, but then later I would have multiple people asking why I didn‚Äôt respond or answer what they sent. Thinking this was just a one time glitch or internet thing (even though i have great WiFi) I moved on and posted one the next day but the same thing happened again. Only getting one response but others upset that I had not seen their‚Äôs. I have now reset the app deleted, reloaded and tried anything to get these messages but I still seem to be only getting one. This is a bit upsetting especially since I love the thrill of this app, I sincerely hope this will be fixed soon.	positive
601	1462082664	social	5	YOLO is the funniest app ever! i can ask my friends whatever i want i‚Äôm always sure i‚Äôm gonna have the best feedbacks. people are nice on the app it‚Äôs really not the kind of app where people insult you or anything. i feel it‚Äôs fun and and the visuals are good i really like it! i hope there is more features later i think i want more options like asking the specifics questions i want. thank you for making the app existing it s really great. all my friends are using it at school its super popular. i used apps like lipsi but it is different it is not fun like yolo and also you KNOW people on yolo are people you actually KNOW which is why it s best. don t listen to bad comments the app is one of the best i have rn i think it s not just going to stop they need to improve it s already good but i can be even better because so we can add so much new fun features i hope they will do that! that s YOLO keep it great!	positive
602	1462082664	social	4	"Honestly I really like Yolo. It‚Äôs a fun app to ask questions on your Snapchat story and interact with your friends. I like the consistent updates and features being added often. 
However, sometimes people like to bully others and that‚Äôs never fun. I posted a simple question asking people about their crushes as a fun little game. Then there was one or more people that were harassing me about a boy I‚Äôm talking to. 
I reported each message that was abusive, and I thought at the very least the person would be revealed to me. Sadly that wasn‚Äôt the case and I‚Äôm assuming that the messages are under review. You‚Äôve never made it quite clear how the reporting system works and what happens if the person you reported is actually found to be abusive. I would like further feedback on that please. 
Overall Yolo is a good app. I hope you guys take the bullying seriously and actually review the messages that are reported. Thank you!"	positive
603	1462082664	social	3	This app was originally working well, however after I‚Äôd had it for about 2 weeks it began sending me notifications for messages, then the messages weren‚Äôt showing up in my inbox. I‚Äôm not sure if the notifications were glitches, or if I actually am getting messages and the app just won‚Äôt let me view them, because it does occasionally show a message. Other then that, the app has been great. I can ask my friends questions, get anonymous compliments, and for the most part, my experience has been rather positive (aside from a few jokes made by my best friend, but she‚Äôs always like that). To be fair, I know a lot of people have been sent inappropriate or rude messages on here, so I would be cautious if you think you would be offended by rude anonymous messages. Overall, YOLO is a decent app and a good way to connect with people, but it does need improvements and may not be good for everyone. I hope this helps!	positive
604	1462082664	social	4	Yolo is a really fun and new way to communicate with the people who view your snap story and I was having a lot of fun using it for a couple of weeks but then randomly it would send me notifications and I‚Äôd go to my inbox and they‚Äôd all be old messages and there would be no new one‚Äôs. At first I thought it was because I had to many undeleted messages, so I deleted the dozens of ones that I had already replied to, however that did not fix the problem. The only way I could start seeing the new yolos I was receiving was by deleting and reinstalling the app every time I got a couple new notifications, which is EXTREMELY annoying and inconvenient. Truly hope this gets fixed soon and it can go back to its 5 star rating, because without the glitches or bugs this app really is a 5 star experience	positive
605	1462082664	social	2	"i love this app a lot , but for some reason i can't revive yolos anymore , this problem has been going on for about 6 months now . i don't get any yolo messages when i post yolos on my story and i even tested it out by sliding up myself and saying something and i didn't get a message . it's really frustrating because i love posting yolos and seeing what people say but now i can't do that anymore . i've deleted it and re downloaded it many times and it still doesn't work . also when other people post yolos i'll slide up and say ""tbh-(my first name) (my last name)"" but that's never get the message , so i don't know why yolo won't let my name go through !! at first i thought that i might've been banned from the app but i don't use inappropriate language , i have clean content (i don't post anything inappropriate) , i'm NEVER bullying anyone or being mean so i have no idea why yolo just won't work . please fix this problem !!"	negative
606	1462082664	social	1	People post these 25/8 on snap. It‚Äôs annoying. You sorta have a pass if you are in middle school or elementary school, but I mean sorta. Dear everyone that is in high school please stop posting these on your story and if you haven‚Äôt downloaded this app yet don‚Äôt. Straight up don‚Äôt download it. Don‚Äôt contribute to the annoyance. It‚Äôs not too late to delete the app if you have it downloaded either. This in my opinion should be deleted off the App Store. If people can‚Äôt say something to someone‚Äôs face they shouldn‚Äôt be able to through a app. This app creates bullying and a bunch of horny guys to say stuff. This is annoying. Did I mention annoying. This is a waste of your storage on your phone. This app has side effects too that include but are not limited to extreme annoyance among peers, addiction to posting on snap story, bullying, rude comments, weird comment, nice comments from someone but u don‚Äôt know who from, stealing of time, stealing of battery %, and decreasing numbers of brain cells.	negative
607	1462082664	social	5	Yolo is chill and awesome, they gave warnings to people that to not bully no one. I like the fact that they give that warnings, but people think that it‚Äôs yolo fault. Some people don‚Äôt listen to the message, I think that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not Yolo‚Äôs fault to begin with. It‚Äôs the user‚Äôs comment fault, if anyone wants to make Yolo to stop they will have to get to see all the information. Plus, anyone shouldn‚Äôt make any bad reviews. Yolo made this just to have fun, they wouldn‚Äôt know if they are bullying them. It would be hard to track all the bullies. They will put all nighters to remind the bullies to stop bullying. Yolo isn‚Äôt involved with any of the drama, you guys should know what to do when a bully is bullying you.	negative
608	1462082664	social	4	"Yolo is a great way to send anonymous feedback or receive it. 
And no, it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt use your private information in a harmful way. It‚Äôs just like Snapchat, they will keep your information to themselves and never give it away. It is a perfectly safe app. 
Now for the bullying part, I can see lots of reviews that hate on this app because of cyber bullying. That‚Äôs why you can reveal their identity and report them. As other people in the reviews say such things as, ‚Äúthis is a perfect way to get bullied‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis is not safe and you should delete this app.‚Äù But they‚Äôre not true. This app will help you reveal bully‚Äôs identity and report hem and get them in trouble. I hope this changes others mind on this app. Thanks!"	positive
609	1462082664	social	1	The app looks sincere, and really it has good intentions. However, this app is just a breeding ground for cyber bullies. The app says that it reports bullying, but I‚Äôve never actually seen it happen. This app gives people the chance to say anything they want, without having to take responsibility for any of it. Many, if not all, of its users are teenagers. If you've met any teenager, you know that they are very immature and do not think before they talk. The same goes for texting. Many people are getting this app to have fun with their friends, and what are they getting? Hate. If I could show you things I‚Äôve received, you would wonder what makes kids think it‚Äôs ok to say that. It‚Äôs horrible. Another big problem with this is it creates lots of drama. Drama in and out of school. It never goes away. The only way I can think to describe it is toxic. Do not get this app. I repeat DO NOT GET THIS APP!	positive
610	1462082664	social	1	anonymous messages give people the opportunity to say the nastiest rudest things to people and suffer no consequences. this app is practically meant for cyberbullying and personally i don‚Äôt think it should exist. DO NOT GET THIS APP. if i could post screenshots of the messages i‚Äôve received, it would look like the burn book from mean girls. and i am a good kid, i am friends with almost everyone. but this app gives people the opportunity to say whatever they want. and teenagers don‚Äôt think before they type. what else is bad about it is that because you have no clue who is sending you these awful messages, it could be your best friends. all i want is for someone to confront me personally if they have a problem with me, i shared that on my story and the responses i got made me delete this app. it‚Äôs extremely toxic. if you care about your mental health, do not download this app.	positive
611	1462082664	social	3	I used to use the app all the time, I‚Äôd post a yolo on my Snapchat everyday and it worked perfectly then one day I got banned from snapchat and it said something about using third party apps that access snapchat and that I have to delete it before I can unlock my account so I deleted Yolo them it let me back into my account so that was obviously the issue. I‚Äôm not sure why it banned me from my own snapchat account but I hate that I had to delete the app. I re downloaded the app and tried to hook it back up to my Snapchat account but the app would crash everytime I signed in so eventually I gave up which is why I only rated it three stars, please fix it to where it doesn‚Äôt crash and doesn‚Äôt ban me from my account again , Thanks	negative
612	1462082664	social	1	At the beginning yolo was so fun. the app says that it will report bullying but never once have I seen that they did it gives people a chance to be mean and not have to take responsibility for it. It is a app that you can hide behind to be mean to other kids without them knowing. I feel that yolo was made so kids can ask questions but it now people use it to be mean and bully. there has been several times where I have seen the meanest comments calling people fat ugly etc. of coarse I felt bad but there is nothing you can do considering the fact that yolo is anonymous. I feel that this app will lead to much worse issues I am a kid who once had yolo and there is a lot of mean things going on and it being Anonymous does not help. Once again this app was very fun at the beginning and I love the idea of it but there is some serious stuff that should be fixed	negative
613	1462082664	social	3	Fine app. I don‚Äôt use it but the concept is alright I guess. It‚Äôs all middle schoolers that do this though and I think that can kind of pose a future problem to interaction with other people. This is going to contribute to a generation that won‚Äôt be able to handle confrontation well. The problem is, everybody is talking smack but it‚Äôs all anonymous. The users are aware of this factor which creates no consequences for any of the smack they are talking. But everybody gangsta online until it‚Äôs in real life. If no one knows how to handle confrontation, no one can be able to develop major problem solving skills. Rate 3/5. 3 because the app has a decent concept and the missing 2 are because of the way it affects the audience. Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk	negative
614	1462082664	social	5	Yolo is so easy and fun to use! I love the genius idea of being able to customize your own questions, making it fit your own style, and allow you to make your own choices. Such as, being able to change the Bitmoji avatar stickers,and right your own question for friends to answer, or pick from many question that yolo provides you! It is so amazing and a genius app in general! It‚Äôs so easy to use as you just download the app, press connect through Snapchat and press accept then your done and ready to send yolos and get honest opinions from your friends and family!	positive
615	1462082664	social	5	"I am a developer and I know exactly how Yolo achieves the activity it does. I have noticed many people saying they can either access your chats, snaps, memories, map, etc. that is simply not true. This app uses Snapchat API called Snap Kit, this is hooked into Swift which is the programming language of iOS apps which use the IPA format. These Snap Kits do not allow such activity and this app simply gets access to your Bitmoji, your Public Name, and access to Sticker, this uses the Bitmoji SnapKit, Sticker SnapKit, and Story SnapKit.

So overall from a Java, Kotlin, Swift, etc. developer. You CAN trust YOLO without having any doubt that your privacy will be invaded."	positive
616	1462082664	social	3	I like how Snapchat made a anonymous messaging app it notifies you immediately when you get a message and yea but there are a lot of issues in this app that need to get fixed when I want to use it sometimes it will say error and then I have to pressed the button over and over again till I can see my messages also if I want people to slide up for example if I take a picture and I don‚Äôt like the picture if I delete the picture the anonymous thing will delete to so I have to go back to the app also it says that they block messages that aren‚Äôt appropriate well they need to check again cause I be getting people saying nasty things to me like this app is just a whole mess and they need to fix all this.	negative
617	1462082664	social	2	Coming from a teen that has had this app, this is probably the easiest way for a bully to reach a peer and make them feel terrible about themselves. It encourages cyberbullying by making it anonymous so they know there is no consequences for their rude comments on the app. Adding to that, it creates tons of drama for the user and the people writing comments. This is a definite way for giving someone a chance to lower your self-esteem. So, if you are looking to get this app I suggest you take note that this can be a HUGE way to get hurt because some people still don‚Äôt realize that words DO HURT, but there is nothing we can do about that. However, to be generous, the app has great quality and works very well, I am jut not a big fan of the content this app provides.	positive
618	1462082664	social	1	Every time I try and open the app, it takes almost 5 minutes to actually start, then it shows me the ‚Äúopen with snapchat‚Äù or ‚Äúopen with phone number‚Äù. If I press the snapchat option, it takes me to snapchat and then it tells me that ‚Äúsomething is wrong, please try again later!‚Äù And then it crashes. I don‚Äôt know if this is Yolo‚Äôs fault or snapchats fault, but it‚Äôs driving me insane. If I press the phone number option, it gives me the opportunity to put my phone number in, I type in my phone number, then it tells me that the phone number was incorrect. It doesn‚Äôt matter what number I put in, it always is incorrect. All my friends are using this app and they love it, and I wanna love it too, but unless they fix this, me and a lot of other people will be disappointed. Please fix this!	positive
619	1462082664	social	1	"This app has been working just fine until yesterday where I tried to put a Yolo on my Snapchat and it didn‚Äôt let me. At first I thought it was my internet connection and I verified everything and it was working fine. Then I restarted my phone because I thought that my phone would be the problem and it wasn‚Äôt it either. Lastly, I erased the app and downloaded it again and it wouldn‚Äôt let be login ... so I had to log in with my phone number and by today I‚Äôm still trying to post a Yolo and it won‚Äôt let me. 
I am extremely mad about it and I just need an explanation on what the actual heck is happening with it.

620	1462082664	social	4	i‚Äôve had yolo for around a year and in the last month or so, the app has sent me notifications and i‚Äôll go on there to see what was said and nothing will show up. just this morning i woke up to 12 notifications from them saying i had received a message and i went to the app and nothing was there. this is just really annoying at this point because either 1.its sending phantom notifications or 2. it‚Äôs delaying when i get them which has also happened recently (my yolo had expired and i was getting random yolos days/weeks after when they said they came in)	positive
621	1462082664	social	3	"Dear Yolo,

Yolo is a fun app I must say and I have to give the person who created this app the full credit. I love the anonymous mystery when someone types, ‚ÄúI like you‚Äù into a slot that you receive later. But some things I don‚Äôt like is the harassment and bullying option. My friend, Andrew, would sometimes get some rude messages telling him that he is ugly. No worries though right? Because we wouldn‚Äôt have to spend most of our time trying to figure out who this is! We were depending on the feature of exposing this user who harassed u, but of course, it was gone. Alright. Now another issue is, the app crashes a lot. When I login to the app it takes a second, and it freezes for a couple more seconds and I get an exit appearance from the app. This highly frustrates me. Just saying.

Fix them both please. We want the old feature where you can expose the person who wrote rude comments to you, and we want a better feature where it handles, crashing bugs to the app. 

Thank you for reading this!

Please write back Yolo."	positive
622	1462082664	social	4	"I like this app very much, it occupies some free time I have. I have two complaints about this app and no more. 

The first thing bothers me a lot, and I don‚Äôt know if the app normally does this, or it‚Äôs a glitch. I usually do not receive notifications from the app when someone sends an anonymous message to me. I have the iPhone 8, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the app or my phone. I‚Äôve checked my settings and the notifications are definitely turned on on my phone. There seems to be no in-app settings and that leads to my second complaint. There should be an in app settings with more controls."	negative
623	1462082664	social	3	I recently broke my iPhone XR, which i had this app on. I got my friends old iPhone 6s and tried redownloading it. Everything was normal. I chose to sign in with SnapChat. I typed in my number. It sent me a verification number. I put the number in. Each and every time i put that verification number in, it told me it was invalid. My number was correct, I was getting the texts. I tried sending a new one about five times before I gave up. I don‚Äôt know why it won‚Äôt let me log in but it‚Äôs really bothering me. All my friends have no problem and I can‚Äôt reply to their yolos without logging into my account, which it won‚Äôt let me do. :(	positive
624	1462082664	social	5	Yolo is amazing, there are similar apps to YOLO like lipsi, but unlike lipsi, you can connect your YOLO to your Snapchat which makes it more convienient! If your not sure what to ask on your YOLO, it already has some options to pick from that are programmed in, however if you would like to create your own question, you can do that as well. You can post multiple different YOLOs asking different questions at the same time, which is also better and more combined than some of the other anonymous messaging apps. I totally recommend YOLO!	positive
625	1462082664	social	5	This app is this the freaking best. You need to get it because u can use it for Snapchat. It also has good graphics. It has good features. It also has good qualities. Please go download the app. Also you go onto the Yolo app and sign in with your Snapchat and then click on get messages and it will open you up to Snapchat and you just post it on your story and in the Yolo app it will show the messages and you don‚Äôt know who it is so it is an fun app. I gave it 5 rate because it is the best app forever. You will thank me for showing you this app. Have fun!!!!üòÇü§™ü§™ü§™	positive
626	1462082664	social	2	Hi, thanks for making This app. I use it all the time from ranges of questions and it was working fine up until now, today all of the messages were gone, my ‚ÄòBunches‚Äô as this app calls it are still there and perfectly fine. But my messages from just recently about last week are missing. I deleted the app, I refreshed the messages section but nothing is working please get out to me ASAP because I need to figure this out. Oh I almost forgot one other thing. I also sent a message to myself to makesure your app wasn‚Äôt down. But I got the notification that I got a message but it wasn‚Äôt in the messages section. So please get out to me and fix this problem üôÇ all regards -K	positive
627	1462082664	social	3	I like the app but my closer friends have asked me if I got their ‚Äúmean‚Äù message and I never get them. I guess the app filters out the anonymous messages if it uses certain words that may ‚Äúhurt‚Äù someone‚Äôs feelings. I can understand how that can be thought of as a good idea but it‚Äôs annoying bcuz then u ARE NOT getting HONEST comments. If comments that are considered rude really offend people there‚Äôs the option to report or block that commenter so they shouldn‚Äôt make it where u never even get to see what they said. Plus friends do ‚Äúmean‚Äù comments to tease each other so it just takes the fun out of the app if u get nothing but positive comments.	negative
628	1462082664	social	3	I am having an issue with your Yolo app. It continues to crash shortly after I open the app. After about 5 seconds of having the app open, it will crash. I have noticed this issue with the app before but it wouldn‚Äôt happen often. Only now, it is happening every time I try opening the app. I have looked in the App Store if there is an update that was needed, but YOLO was not listed for any updates. I also tried deleting and reinstalling the app and the problem continued to occur. I have also restarted my phone as well and closed all my apps. Still nothing works. I‚Äôm not sure what else to do.	negative
629	1462082664	social	1	I loved this app after the recent events that happened though not only to me but also my friends I will be switching to a different anonymous app as I do sometimes I was trying to receive anonymous messages from my Snapchat but when people tried to slide up they server was not found later when I tried to open the app it wouldn‚Äôt i will open it and it will load then quickly shut down and take me back to home screen I have tried everything to get back in my account so I will be letting people who want the app about how much of a piece of shot this app is when not even blocking people works so I will make sure my entire Snapchat knows about the inconvenience this app has caused me	positive
630	1462082664	social	5	Now Yolo is a lot better than Lipsi in many ways. Ok fine, Lipsi may allow you to message the person back and doesn‚Äôt need Snapchat to work but, 99% of the time people used Lipsi on Snapchat anyways. On Yolo there is no hassle of creating an account because you can just simply login to your Snapchat account. Hopefully in the future the message back feature is added but if that was added it would just give this app 6 stars but without that feature it‚Äôs still 5/5 stars	positive
631	1462082664	social	4	Personally, I am impressed by the efficiency of this app. It works very quickly and pairs with snapchat very well. The whole anonymous aspect can be fun, but with Snapchat‚Äôs main audience being teenagers, not everyone is always nice. Children are more willing to say something mean on this app, because the receiving end doesn‚Äôt know who sent it. I don‚Äôt think this app can cause many issues, and personally I‚Äôve had good experience with it. I am just aware of possible outcomes this app could have, keep up the good work though!	positive
632	1462082664	social	2	It used to work just fine, and today i went to use it and i was getting all sort of notifications telling me that i had received messages, but NONE of them were showing up in the app, not even the old ones i had received before, my inbox was just completely wiped. So I uninstalled the app and installed it again, and now it won't let me log in or make a new one, it keeps telling me my phone number doesn't exist and won't let me do anything on the app. This is insanely frustrating, as I used to love using this app. I think I'll try to get it working one more time and if the same issue occurs I'll use a different app.	positive
633	1462082664	social	5	Lots of people get this app to get honest feedback. I know I did. I saw all these other people getting loads of anonymous messages, and it looked fun. But when I make a sticker, I rarely get a response. About 40 people see it, but nobody responds. So before you download, just remember not to worry or take the lack of responses personally! The app is really easy to use and the Bitmoji-only group chat is a great concept, just needs a few more superpowers or other unique things.	positive
634	1462082664	social	3	I used to love YOLO until this happend‚òπÔ∏è One day Snapchat was updated and when I was about to make a YOLO it didn‚Äôt show up on my Snapchatüò¢ So I decided to just delete that app and then download it again. Unfortunately this made it worse and when I put in the password that is required for YOLO it just said ‚ÄúInvalid number please try again later‚Äù I was confused cause I put in the right numbers.

635	1462082664	social	2	so I‚Äôve been using this app for a while now, and I liked the idea of the bullying process because every other app like this doesn‚Äôt have that BUT I realized that the warning or ‚Äúmessage‚Äù doesn‚Äôt actually mean anything. I‚Äôm constantly getting harassed on the app and people constantly disrespecting me and my relationship. Also, when I block people, those people don‚Äôt actually get blocked because they're still able to contact me through the app. I‚Äôve had threats, people call me names and start horrible problems with me through this. I want to be able to use this able like everyone else without all the bullying	negative
636	1462082664	social	3	So i got this app a couple days ago and used it a lot between then and now and i got a yolo earlier this morning and it worked fine, but the i got a yolo a couple minutes ago and i went to check it but the app did not load. I restarted the app 3 times then when that didn‚Äôt work I restarted my phone. Then after that didn‚Äôt work I uninstalled the app and reinstalled it. I went to log into my account but said there was an error and now I can‚Äôt log in but it says i had but i still can‚Äôt see my previous yolos. Please fix this quick‚ù§Ô∏è	positive
637	1462082664	social	2	First off , i find it dumb that anyone can kick someone out of the group chat, EVEN THE CREATOR. Then the creators have to start a whole other group chat which is too much work. Secondly , why is one person bitmoji different on multiple devices ? Me and my friend have a mutual friend but her bitmoji looks different on our phones . Please fix these problems because I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing it. We need to be able to choose who we want to be friends with . Like a panel to add someone from Yolo either on snap or Yolo. Maybe even have a private chat option so that they can talk on the app. Other than that , it‚Äôs a nice app.	positive
638	1462082664	social	4	"This app is fun in all but it is also very rude. Say if they found out that a person said they liked them, well then they would be very embarrass. Another reason is if they are saying ‚Äú you look like a rotten apple!‚Äù Well would that make you feel bad if you found out who that was, and say they were messing around. Well that wouldn‚Äôt change nothing, but it might! So please be careful of what you say and who you say it to, please!

Don‚Äôt let anyone let you down because you are strong!üôÇ"	positive
639	1462082664	social	2	Honestly I think that this app is great but what are the creators really doing about the bullying? I just watched a movie about being anonymous. Bullying should not be tolerated. It isn‚Äôt like the creators can put This on their app ‚Äú press accept if you are not a bully‚Äù. Because they will just accept no mater what. I think being anonymous is just people being to scared to say what‚Äôs on their mind or even the truth. ( I know that this all sounds mean. But is wasn‚Äôt meant to be friendly either. ) so I am going to ask again what are the creators of yolo really doing to stop the bullying from happening?	negative
640	1462082664	social	4	Great app overall, especially with the integration with snapchat that makes it a breeze to respond to messages; however, it doesn‚Äôt always work. Lots of glitches that make it unusable at times. I‚Äôve had multiple glitches happen that tend to go away within a week or so, but still are very annoying. I‚Äôd give it five stars if they took care of all of these problems, but I understand that patching can be hard. Still a solid app though	negative
641	1462082664	social	4	This app is very good and convenient. It directly connects to snap and then all u have to do is post it. The thing is‚Ä¶it pops up on the camera screen and u cant add any photo or video attachments from camera roll while its on screen. I can only take live selfies. Many times i feel the urge to attach a funny video in the background that fits with whatever absurd thing someone might've said. I come to realize that i have to make a separate slide with the video and its a bummer. Hopefully, more updates to come!!	positive
642	1462082664	social	3	So yolo is clearly a trendy app and i haven‚Äôt done it in a while. I posted a yolo on my story and didn‚Äôt receive any messages. The next morning at school my friends asked why i never posted my response to any texts and I said I never received any. My friends told me they all slid up. Today i posted another yolo and slid up on my own. I messaged myself saying ‚Äúhello‚Äù and got the notification. But, when i open the yolo app, no messages are there no matter how many times i refresh. Past messages from months ago have disappeared to. Please fix this.	positive
643	1462082664	social	5	I like to use YOLO every now and again when I‚Äôm bored but now whenever I use it it says ‚Äúsomething went wrong please try again later‚Äù. Now, I have deleted and reinstalled the app multiple times but the same thing happens every time. I cannot ask anything. Please fix this problem or tell me how to fix it please. Thank you for your time and I‚Äôm asking you to not let this review go over your mind.	neutral
644	1462082664	social	1	At first I thought YOLO was cool because it was easy to use, had great graphics, and most of my friends use it. But then I became suspicious... since you log into YOLO with your pre-existing Snapchat account, it has access to where you are on the ‚ÄúSnap Map‚Äù, or a map that your friends can use to see where you are, allowing YOLO to constantly know things such as your location, (even when you are not using the app), phone number, contacts, emails, and even photos and videos in your camera roll. I definitely recommend Lipsi. It doesn‚Äôt run through Snapchat and doesn‚Äôt need your information. This app seems great but is a little sketchy- wouldn‚Äôt recommend it.	positive
645	1462082664	social	2	So I got this app last year wand was cool wit it and all. I got a new phone but kept the same number but got a new snap bc I‚Äôm embarrassed about my old user name from middle school. Besides the point. Anyways when I would try and log in with my new snap and number it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to it kept saying incorrect and or would just kick me off. I even tried on my old snap to see if it was bc my number was linked to mo old account which it wasn‚Äôt it still didn‚Äôt work. I proceeded to delete and re-down load this app manny times and still didn‚Äôt work. Other than that it‚Äôs ok ig.	positive
646	1462082664	social	3	I have had this app for a little while and just recently I posted on my Snapchat for people to guess who my crush is. This was meant purely for fun and entertainment, but then ones user who is annomous wrote a long paragraph saying that I was lying about my feelings towards a certain person. I am just very offended that someone thinks they can take my emotions and decide whether or not I express then and in what way I express then. I feel like this app was meant for the good purpose of sending kind thinks to sooner but it's mainly used for bullies.	positive
647	1462082664	social	4	I really like this app, Ive been using for awhile and nothing sketchy has happened. Is anyone else frustrated though that they can‚Äôt figure out who said what?! My only wish is that it had a private messaging system with the anonymous message. This would short of be like Instagram but the person is anonymous and you can chat with them in the app. I think this would be a nice feature to see and possibly figure out who the person is.	positive
648	1462082664	social	5	Okay so funny story. I used this app for Snapchat, as everyone does. Well on snap, I had a bunch of people added from random parties/orientation and that kinda stuff. Well I posted a YOLO and this guy wrote ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen you around, your super cute, just want a chance to get to know you‚Äù and we‚Äôve been dating for almost a year. YOLO pls sponsor us, we would love to tell our story about how you were such a big part of us being together.	positive
649	1462082664	social	5	"Great app. This app does exactly what it says it does. Now to all the people complaining about ‚Äúnegative‚Äù messages, you need to realize you are giving people a platform to say whatever they want. With anonymity comes brutal honesty. 
Some users want the identity‚Äôs of the people who leave negative comments in the app... this app I built on that fact that you can ANONYMOUSLY send messages. If you can‚Äôt handle people being ‚Äúmean‚Äù don‚Äôt get this app."	positive
650	686449807	social	4	"I am enjoying telegram as my main chatting app as it‚Äôs secure faster & fun to use! But unfortunately it has only voice calling feature which makes me to use another apps for that feature only! I cordially expect that developer will add that asap! 

It‚Äôs passcode locking feature in order to provide best security to its user, but apps lock doesn‚Äôt work immediately! Which should be must! The minimum time is 1 minutes! It should be locked within a fraction of second as some other apps do! As long as we have face unlocking feature so it will not bother us! 
Lastly, I have facing an unexpected issue sometimes! I‚Äôm not sure where I tap but when it happens telegram stop functioning & start glitching non stop glitching! It needs the apps to launch again! 
So please make the apps more lovely by adding video calling features and make the passcode lock more quicker & fix the bug! Thanks for reading with patience!"	positive
651	686449807	social	1	I have had Telegram for a few years. I installed it because some contact mentioned that they use is for communication just like many other of global contacts who use various different Apps for communication and I download them to make it easy for my contact to reach me. I have about 11 such apps and Telegram is the only App that will intermittently big me with notifications that someone in my contact list has joined Telegram and other silly alerts that have noting to go with me receiving a message from a contact. I just received 11 notifications back to back that 11 of my contacts joined Telegram. First of all it‚Äôs not a coincidence that 11 different people who have nothing in common other than being in my contact list join Telegram at the very same second. So obviously, this is a cheap way of Telegram trying to engage with me. I seriously don‚Äôt give a crap who is in or not. If they are and they need to reach me then and only then I‚Äôd like to be alerted. Kindly fix your unnecessary alerts or give me the option of what alerts I‚Äôd like to get and I‚Äôll change my ratings for you.	positive
652	686449807	social	3	"In this day and age video calling is a must with every app such as Telegram, and lack of it unnecessarily opens the door for the competition. Despite my desire to solely use Telegram to connect with friends & family all over the world, I‚Äôm having to use other apps, because of the lack of this feature in this app, and I‚Äôm sure this is the case for most of its other users.
I‚Äôd give this app 4 stars if it had the video calling feature, and 5 if it wasn‚Äôt for some other malfunctions I come across every now and then, such as, all of a sudden losing all my communications with a contact from the beginning till a random date, or altogether till the present! This has happened to me several times with different contacts, so I highly recommend backing your communications up if they‚Äôre important to you. 
I really hope, and strongly suggest that the developers add the video calling feature ASAP.

653	686449807	social	3	"I enjoy using the app much more than any other social media messaging platform. The ability to create group chats, call people, and customizable features in addition to a UI that is seamless with other devices, and doesn't stutter is a treat.

 But, in some areas telegram falls short due to lack of video messaging, the traffic seems to be lower than other platforms, and searching for groups isn't as easy as some may like it to be. Regardless, a video chat feature similar to instagrams live mode would be perfect for the group chats. If possible maybe even allowing features thats on discord to be on the app, better bots would be a plus that telegram makes themselves rather than relying on other people bots. Most bots seem to not work as well as the competition. 

Overall its a great 1 v 1 app, but apps such as WhatsApp or instagrams video-calling is superior, and discords bots and chat customization is superior. Telegram is the perfect middle ground that could do better."	positive
654	686449807	social	3	I am visually impaired, and I use Voice Over to navigate through the various features on my IPhone 8. I am using the most current version of IOS 13. I can only use Voice Over when listening to a single contact (I can activate the play button). But when I try to activate the play button when chatting within a group, Voice Over does not work. Instead, I have to turn Voice Over off and activate play like a user who is sighted. I fortunately have enough vision to do this, but a blind or visually impaired person with less or no vision would not be able to perform the work around I have found. I have tried to report this several times, and I have received no feedback at all. I find that to be very discouraging. I know that some blind useds are experiencing the same problem while others are not, so it is not an across the board problem. However, the issue still needs to be invchstigated.	negative
655	686449807	social	2	"Telegram was almost bug free, but version 5 introduced a host of new bugs that were previously fixed. 1) ""Last seen"" time is no longer accurate. It takes a few minutes to update. Often it tells me that I was last seen 30 minutes ago, when I'm online! 2) the search feature is broken: it has the glitch that only shows 100 results maximum. Previously it used to tell me how many messages each person sent to the chat, which was in the tens of thousands. Now each person has allegedly only sent 100 messages. 3) The same old message notification keeps being pushed to my Notification Center after I've cleared it from there multiple times. This happens for days at a time for the same notification.

EDIT 12/19: Developer mentioned the update, well issue 1 was not fixed with the recent update that was pushed out. However, I can report that issue 2 has been fixed. Still noticing issue 3, and will email about it. Thanks"	positive
656	686449807	social	1	"The Feb. 3 update still includes the really annoying bug.  To test the new update, I typed ""This is a test of Telegram's new updated app.""  Here is what Telegram got:  ""Thisi atTelegram's nbew pda app.""  Clearly, this is still completely unusable.  If anything, the number of dropped characters is worse than it was originally.

Original review:
Updating to the latest version introduced a really bad bug that causes keyboard input to get corrupted.  When I type on my Bluetooth keyboard now, Telegram acts like I also typed random backspaces every few characters, completely messing up the words I type, and inducing auto-correct to change many of the messed-up words to something completely different.  Please fix this right away!
I've installed every update since the bug was introduced, and none of them have addressed the problem!  I just updated again today (Jan. 9), and the problem is as bad as ever.  I have to type very slowly and constantly correct Telegram's mistakes, making it nearly unusable."	negative
657	686449807	social	3	I love the idea of this app and I love that it has polls, rules set, bots, and other things but my app crashes 100% of the time when ever I go into settings to check out the ‚ÄúMasks‚Äù. It just kicks me out the app than when I look for stickers there‚Äôs only a few compared to what others claim they have (I‚Äôm only seeing a little when others have and see a lot more options than me) and I‚Äôm unable to find Chatrooms. The only option I have is to open messages to chat with someone but I want to go to a chatroom. Not chat with someone. Someone said I‚Äôm fully missing the icon (a magnify glass) and only have the box with a pencil which is for starting a new message with someone. Can this be fixed soon? I just download the app three days ago. So there isn‚Äôt any updates I‚Äôm neglecting to update when it says the last update was two week ago. Someone mind helping?	positive
658	686449807	social	2	"Telegram does a lot of things right, but its total lack of customization of usability settings isn‚Äôt one of them.

‚ÄúRaise to listen‚Äú is forced on. Any random time something comes close to your phone, it decides you‚Äôve raised it to your head and starts a voice recording. There‚Äôs a secret debug menu (not mentioned anywhere) accessed by tapping ‚Äúsettings‚Äù 10 times, but even turning it off there doesn‚Äôt fix it. 

This breaks when more since circle videos autoplay ‚Äî a conversation with them means you‚Äôll constantly be going back to watch someone‚Äôs that you missed, and then *your* video after will play. Possibly at double their volume. And you‚Äôll have to stop it manually, every single time. 

But what‚Äôs worse is that if any circle video is paused, and there‚Äôs play/pause on the top bar, then raise to listen will override and play *no matter what*. Even if you have it forced off in the secret debug menu. 

For every hour of circle video conversation, this means manually stopping autoplay and having to hit the little X literally hundreds of times just to make your own recordings not play loudly at you, and your phone‚Äôs sensor not delete what you were recording because a cat got too close to your phone and it decided it was your ear. 

All because Telegram really, *really* doesn‚Äôt like giving you options as to how you use the app."	negative
659	686449807	social	2	"Hey dev team, the auto save feature for all media (images specifically) isn‚Äôt working since I updated to publicly available ios 12. It worked perfectly on all betas of iOS 12 and stable versions of previous iOS but now it became very frustrating as I expected to see all images received to be in photo gallery but aren‚Äôt being saved for some reason.
I tried reinstalling both Telegram and iOS, tested telegram on 3 different iPhones but nothing seem to be helpful in this case.
Media auto save is enabled in settings and app has access to photos so no permission issues as far as I understand.
I also sent a message to app support few weeks ago and never head back from them so this is the last step before I start looking for alternatives.
Another big issue is calls quality/reliability. Every time I call someone after few min I hear beeps that indicate lost/poor network, then I can hear other party again but they can‚Äôt hear me or call just drops after 15-20 seconds. The longer the call (multiple calls) is the more often it breaks and I have to call that person again.
I‚Äôm on latest iOS 12.0.1 and iPhone XS Max 256.
Hoping to see these two fixed in the next update.
Once this and dropping calls is fixed Telegram will be again my favorite messenger. Until then - 2 star review."	positive

The only bad I can say with this app, lies not with its developers, but with Apple and the AppStore. I‚Äôll find channels with discourse of all varying opinions. Something I find refreshing. But I‚Äôll then go to revisit, only be prompted that the channel is blocked due to violations of AppStore guidelines. There is no violation. It‚Äôs Apple using its corporate mass to silence opinions it seems as bad. 

Because of this, I will NEVER use or buy another Apple product. Once this phone dies, that‚Äôs it. Anything but an Apple. ANY other phone. A product and company, that keeps me from viewing content that I sought out myself, should never even make it to market"	negative

There‚Äôs so much choices and I am amazed by the themes and choices they have. Program: runs as fluid as a slippery butter on a pancake, it is fantastic. Encryption technology software?: Beats Facebook messenger to the rocks. Safety?: As safe in no penetration of Russian bots migrating like Trojans. Clear and safe to hold a secure conversation. Recommendation?: For the love of God download this app, delete messenger and any other sms wanna be replacement platform.

663	686449807	social	4	"This is my go-to messaging service. Security, speed, functionality, and fun features are all here. 

There are a few downfalls to the platform, such as groups being a little clunky to create if you do not have the people you are adding to the group in your contacts, no video calling, needing to use your phone number to make an account, etc., but these are all minor issues with an otherwise superb service that is always being improved. It‚Äôs great to be able to send a file and not have to worry too much about file transfer limits, like on Discord. 

Since the standard Telegram app became telegram X, I found one bug- most of my sticker packs will not correctly load, and will be unusable. That‚Äôs the only bug I‚Äôve encountered so far."	positive
664	686449807	social	4	"Telegram is a perfect, secure, high speed cloud based messenger which it makes it almost the most powerful messenger app. 
But the problem is ‚Äúfile‚Äù sharing on iPhone. When you want to share a heavy file (by tapping the share button on the file and choose telegram to send) you have to look at the upload progress till it finishes the  percentage line! If you skip this level or want to do something else on your phone you won‚Äôt be able, or you will lose your file sharing progress. Whatsapp isn't like that and the file can be seen in your whatsapp messenger even if it has not been sent with a ‚Äúretry sending‚Äù button that can easily send your file in the app itself and without exiting the messenger.

i heavily use the saved messages feature (the messages you share with yourself). 

last but not least, the fact that this platform is accessible on so many mediums, makes it easy to share thoughts and ideas across devices."	positive
666	686449807	social	2	"I really like the telegram app. Unfortunately I use a bunch of different group chats. The app refreshes so fast that I cannot  click on the message fast enough. I have to hit edit and then I can maybe scroll down to see it - often not.  

I think that when you click on the message icon it should automatically put those messages at the very top and hold them there until they are viewed. Until this is done I cannot give it more stars because it is very aggravating to try to see who messaged me. Sometimes I have to go on the web version on my ipad but there I cannot see the line that has the message icon. It doesn‚Äôt scroll down far enough. So then I have to go on the computer to the web version there. There everything works much better.

Please make these improvements!! Thanks."	positive
667	686449807	social	3	I love telegram and have used it for years, but one problem that was been very annoying for the last 6-12 months since I have really started to use it on the iPad is that while typing in Telegram on a Bluetooth keyboard or Apple keyboard, the typing is very laggy and buggy. After a sentence or two is typed, it really starts to slow down and also makes more typing errors. It‚Äôs like it cant keep up. I was hoping an update would solve this, but many updates have gone through and nothing. I do not have this issue on any other app besides Telegram. It almost makes it not worth it to even type a message out on Telegram it is so bad. Please address Telegram! This should be a simple fix! Telegram is great besides this and fits all of what I want in a messaging app!	positive
668	686449807	social	4	"Yo I love this messenger app but there‚Äôs a bug (or IDK maybe it‚Äôs feature-related but it drives me crazy) where if you use the app in slide-over mode on iPadOS, the Message Compose box is half-way obscured by the keyboard suggestion bar. This happens both with soft-keyboards and hardware keyboards. In full-screen (iPad, iPhone) and in side-by-side mode (iPad), it‚Äôs fine.
Other than the keyboard bar issue, this issue gets 5/5 from me. The groups work so much better than in other apps, you can reply to messages with rich previews and link back to the original message for context. The rich inline previews work amazingly, the sticker ecosystem is one of the best I‚Äôve seen, and the calling and encrypted messaging features are a cherry on top!"	positive
669	686449807	social	4	This messaging app to me is a new and more better then Kik. Not trying to diss any app developers but telegram is at a level where simply anyone can understand. I was informed that this app has been around for sometime, and I‚Äôm just starting to hear about it. It has it‚Äôs highs and lows, let‚Äôs start with the lows when first accessing the app there‚Äôs a need of your phone number. Basic requirement, but I‚Äôve started having problems with in an hour or so of using the app it starts popping up back to the beginning when I first entered my number.

I‚Äôve recently gotten a 7th gen iPad with the keyboard case attachment, and for some reason, using the keyboard in Telegram is disastrous. Words will delete themselves and the text cursor will back up as if another force is trying to move it, meaning my messages are full of missing words and typed over mistakes. It‚Äôs frustrating, but not constant; it comes and goes. Unfortunately, it happens a little to much for my tastes.

BUT!! I noticed the options has changed for the worse.. the last few months I noticed that I can‚Äôt leave groups I no longer want to be in!!! I can‚Äôt delete members (even if I was the admin :/) and there is groups that none of the members are admins!!! So what happened exactly?"	positive

I am using this app for years now and i am gonna use it, even thogh my governement is so uncomfortable with itüòÑ
And in order to use this app better i think adding two options would be great:
1. Abbilty to orgnize channels and groups and even chats in the SUBJECT order (for example: work, school, college, entertainment and ...)
2. Feed for channels ( i dont know if i am spelling rightüôÑ) I mean somthing like instagram, to put all the channels you want on the feed and all of them appear on one place (and i know that is a huge request)
Aftre all i wanted you to know that we as iranins ( more than 40milion users and sellers and costumers) are waiting for your BLOCKCHAIN  update to fight and stand for our freedom for usinge which app we want, not the one THEY dicide for us!
Thank you telegram for every thing
(Sorry for grammer and spelling mistakes,üòÑ this is not my mother language)
Sincerely,a SUFFERD irannian person"	positive

But if you want to chat with your friends using a wireless keyboard there‚Äôs a delay when typing, sometimes it misses what you wanted to write entirely. A good example of this small issue while using the app; lets just say you want to write the word, ‚ÄòBecause‚Äô and if you know how to type you‚Äôre in trouble. The app would miss words in between you‚Äôll end up with something like ‚Äúbecue‚Äù and it happens a lot. This never happened before but its starting to become a problem now because sometimes I‚Äôll end up with nothing!"	positive

Unfortunately, some Telegram features, such as stickers, don‚Äôt work correctly under iOS 11.4 that was just released ‚Äì even though we fixed this issue weeks ago. 

Apple has been preventing Telegram from updating its iOS apps globally ever since the Russian authorities ordered Apple to remove Telegram from the App Store. Russia banned Telegram on its territory in April because we refused to provide decryption keys for all our users‚Äô communications to Russia‚Äôs security agencies. We believe we did the only possible thing, preserving the right of our users to privacy in a troubled country. 

Unfortunately, Apple didn‚Äôt side with us. While Russia makes up only 7% of Telegram‚Äôs userbase, Apple is restricting updates for all Telegram users around the world since mid-April. As a result, we‚Äôve also been unable to fully comply with GDPR for our EU-users by the deadline of May 25, 2018. We are continuing our efforts to resolve the situation and will keep you updated.

Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your patience."	negative

Although, after this recent update, .WAV file playback of previously downloaded audio is not working. As a music artist, I tend to send others and myself the music I have made in this format as its high quality and I can play it wherever I am even without a internet connection. The player that used to open on .WAV files I assume has been switched for the player that plays .MP3 files. It does not play the .WAV files I had downloaded."	positive

I tried to mute the group then unmute it, also try to reset all settings in iPhone, also I tried another telegram apps in App store, same issue still exist for all the admins.

I appreciate the last changes, but it seems that something has changed to sharing feature. In previous versions when I wanted to share from another app to Telegram it all worked flawlessly. Now for some reason after  command to share via Telegram it pop-ups another sharing screen, where I need to share it again. Oddly enough, it has different colour scheme: my main theme is dark and first sharing screen also comes in black, as it supposed to be. However second one pop-ups in white. Hope you will address this issue in the next update. Happy New Year!"	positive

Todays update looks every more better now with bages! My one and only request is that you please allow us more than 5 pinned chats.  Im sure myself and the other users in the telegram community would love atleast 10. Some of the users have hundreds of groups and its very hard to prioritize with only being allowed 5. Thanks for all you have done telegram i love the app and hope to soon seen more pinned groups allowed -proud user	positive
683	686449807	social	4	"Why don‚Äôt voice recordings (made outside the telegram app but sent in chat) and GIFs show up in ‚Äúshared media?‚Äù Maybe in a future version, would it be possible to see GIFs in the shared media section, excluding the ones that are stickers? 

I also have some wild ideas I can‚Äôt keep to myself! 

Feature suggestion: it would be awesome if I could jump to the point in the standard chat where a photo was sent. Like I could tap on the picture in shared media, and there would be an option to jump to the day/time it was sent. 
Another related feature- what if I could jump to a specific time? ‚ÄúHmm, what were we talking about on Nov. 4, 2019?‚Äù And I could somehow jump to the start of that day. 
One more! - what if we could ‚Äúbookmark‚Äù specific moments in the chat, so we could jump back to that point and reread messages? I suppose a bookmarks section would be needed for this.

Telegram is a great app. I really love the improved search! It shows every time a word was said, instead of just the most recent time. It‚Äôs great!"	positive
684	686449807	social	4	"This is no doubt my favorite messenger app and I advocate for it among my friends.

One problem: since some update about a month or two ago, messages that failed to be sent due to no connection (that lasted for a significant amount of time: 30min, 60min), don‚Äôt get sent automatically in the background once the internet connection appears. 

I am angry because I am used to the behavior that if I once press Send on a message, I don‚Äôt have to think about it again and it is *guaranteed* be delivered. Without this behavior, I have to manually check each and every message I‚Äôve sent (which I don‚Äôt do) and otherwise get into inconvenient situations when someone needed to get my message hours earlier.

I would like to hear a reply from the Telegram team as for the reason for removal of this feature or a confirmation that it is just a temporarily bug that you will solve. If this is a performance issue, please provide an option in the settings to persistently keep trying to send messages, as it used to work before."	positive

However I would like to add a suggestion regarding the stickers; I love how there was a huge selection of stickers on Line, I have sooooo many on that app right now but cannot use them anymore due to issues with the app itself, is there any way to have more of a bigger selection of stickers like Line?

686	686449807	social	3	A few days ago it was working perfectly fine, the next night I go to use it on my iPod, it crashes out multiple times. I've tried uninstalling and then reinstalling it. Did nothing (just did it a third time same result) I even did a restart on the device itself, a couple of times and nothing! None of the usual fixes work for this! It still works on my phone but I use it on my iPod when I use my phone to watch a movie or something so I don't have to constantly pause and 'tab' out. And this is usually when I am in my bed at night and not near my desktop which also has Telegram on it. But this is getting really annoying please fix it!!!!	positive
687	686449807	social	1	As a Furry, I downloaded this app because everyone likes the sticker mechanic. I was having fun chatting with people I knew on it until I discovered groups. This opened up a whole new way of communicating with people who have common interests with me. I started connecting with these random people, building relationships, having laughs, using this 17+ app to spread 17+ content but low and behold the group that I became the admin of and was spreading 17+ content in was blocked. Nothing from Telegram saying why or if it could be fixed so I may continue enjoying their app. Nothing about what content specifically called for the blocking. Nothing. If you wish to use this for a fun time, turn back while you can cause even Twitter is better. They aren‚Äôt 17+ but they have thriving 17+ accounts. Why are they allowed to have that and not telegram?	positive

1: Let users hide saved messages from the messages bar.
2: If you archive some chats or groups, it becomes unarchived by the time somebody mentions you in the group or chat. This feature is not that match with the archiving ability (which is used much as a hiding feature not a archive feature)
3: I think it would be very helpful if you let people to post messages and send files (pics, videos, and etc.) with knowing that nobody could forward those (taking screenshots are inescapable.
4: Let people archive their chats in a file as they can access them later if anything happened to their telegram account. I mean that the telegram messenger app has the ability to read files and apply it for messages and to recover chats if we took a backup already.
By the way. Thanks for your time."	positive
691	686449807	social	1	First off, telegram NEVER correctly downloads an entire chat from a group chat. It‚Äôll say there haven‚Äôt been any messages since 6am when in reality there have been over a hundred. To fix this I am CONSTANTLY deleting and re-downloading telegram. This happened again and I had to delete and download again, and now it‚Äôs showing a glitch that it cannot log me in because I have no internet connection. I‚Äôve tried restarting my device, tried on other devices, tried on data instead of WiFi, same glitch. Yet every single other application (Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Email) is working just fine and I have perfect internet speed and connection. Fix this because it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating and I have to use this app as a part of my job, this is stopping me from doing so.	negative
692	686449807	social	2	"Telegram has been a messaging service that is very light, quick, yet full of useful features such as mentioning ‚Äî and most of all, completely free without disturbing adds and other privacy concerns. 
Yet even with the latest update, this app still has a number of glitches on the iOS 11. Some are crucial ‚Äî like if you open the app as slide over on an iPad with hardware keyboard attached, the input field will be hidden beneath the keyboard shortcut UI, making it very hard to type correctly. 
Besides all the issues I‚Äôm having, this still is my favorite messaging service yet, and really hope to see it fully optimized for iOS ‚Äî possibly with support for drag-and-drop and VoiceOver ‚Äî as soon as possible."	positive
693	686449807	social	2	"No doubt the app is amazing, but it is of no use to me and millions like me who could not look into the app like most of the people do, we use an accessibility service called Voice Over screen reader  instead that would read aloud what‚Äôs there on screen. But unfortunately VO does not work that well on this app, I am not even able to go from  one message to another by swiping, this is a result of bad coding practice wrt accessibility.

If you are coming across this kind of request for the first time, suggest you to Google ‚ÄúDeveloping accessible apps on iOS‚Äù and learn about implementing  accessibility APIs offered on iOS, so that everyone could use it easily.

Still you need assistance  to make your app accessible, I would be happy to help."	positive
694	686449807	social	2	This is an easy application to use and I really appreciate end to end encryption. Dynamic dark mode is nice too. However, the latest update won‚Äôt send the messages I type when replying directly from a notification. More often than not, this is the way I interact with the app. For two days I have been replying to messages thinking that they have been sent, only learning that they have not been sent at all after opening the app. I asked my contacts if they had received the messages, that maybe they just weren‚Äôt showing up for me, and they had not. This loss of functionality makes using Telegram very frustrating. I hope this is an easy fix.	positive

They are still producing, watching, and distributing the films under Telegram‚Äôs protection and the only way to throw every single one of those animals in jail as they deserve it is for Telegram to admit that ‚Äúsafe messaging‚Äù and ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù only apply to human beings, not monsters like these, and cooperate with the S.

698	686449807	social	4	I use Telegram to keep in contact with lovely people I met through tumblr but who live overseas, so regular texting wouldn't work without racking up huge fees. Telegram makes conversations easy, and I love being able to see when my friends have been online last. And the ability to send gifs is wonderful! I do, however, have some suggestions: When a gif is received from someone else, it would be nice to be able to save that gif to my phone.

So far the application that incorporates the feature to speed up audio messages best is the Voxer app, however, in every other aspect Voxer is straight up wack. 

Telegram, please incorporate multiple audio speeds or at least one at x1.5 the speed. The x2 speed is a bit too fast the majority of the time. 

Other than that it seems to be just as great or better than WhatsApp. If there were more audio speeds I‚Äôd rate it perfectly for my use."	positive

However, all of these customer‚Äôs should receive their money back. The option of travel credit is also not what I want. They are making it so difficult to get my money back in return because I haven‚Äôt given ‚Äúproper documentation.‚Äù That is completely ludicrous! I have sent them documentations of my working in the hospital and my employer stating travel restrictions due to risk of contaminating patients with the virus. I‚Äôve also sent them documentation of my flight being cancelled. My flight and other activities did really well in customer service and being able to return my money in full. But AIRBNB has been so difficult to work with. They have no common sense at all! They are still giving me a difficult time with getting my refund of my money to my card. They instead want to trick you into getting a travel credit for future reservations. Due to their lack of customer service, I told them I don‚Äôt intend to make future arrangements with AIRBNB. But they are dragging this on to the point where it‚Äôs close to my reservation date. All I want is my money back. I also fall under the extenuating circumstances category, yet still they have been so difficult to work with. And I don‚Äôt know what to do. They are really just off to steal my money.	negative
701	401626263	travel	1	"First off it takes forever for Airbnb support to get back in touch with you. I dealt with a place INFESTED WITH SPIDERS! And it took DAYS to deal with customer service for a solution. They then wanted proof and I sent a pic of one spider and they said it was NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE! Then I sent 4 pics of 4 different spiders and THEH CLOSED MY CASE WITHOUT A RESOLUTION! A hotel would NEVER make a guest prove an infestation to change rooms!!!!! And they wanted me to talk to the host about it like I want to confront someone about their spider infestation in Their home! Thats not my place! I paid hundreds of dollars to be comfortable!

I literally slept with all the lights on to deter more spiders and slept with a towel over my eyes to block the light!!! 

I also dealt with an issue where I wanted to stay in a place for 2 weeks but needed one night to not be there since I was working in a town for one day an hour away. I didn‚Äôt want to pay the ‚Äúarbitrary‚Äù service and cleaning fees just because I needed one night away which could add up to be over a hundred dollars. Their support said I could not so this and that I had to make 2 separate bookings and pay the fees twice!!!!!!! What!!! Hotels don‚Äôt do that! Hotels don‚Äôt charge you those arbitrary fees either! This whole company is just horrible! And I travel 100% of the time so they will be missing out on $2400 a month from this guy here!!"	negative
702	401626263	travel	1	I had the worst experience ever! Every year my family makes plans to go out of town to celebrate Christmas, this year we decided Orlando, FL. I heard about AirBnb and decided to check it out. I reserved a house for December 27-January 2 and reserved it on August. I get a text a week before the trip saying the host canceled the reservation. The host didn‚Äôt let me know the reason and just canceled. I try contacting the host and he didn‚Äôt respond to my calls and text. I call customer service and they tell me it was an emergency and that my money is going to be refunded in 5 to 10 business days. They didn‚Äôt give me an explanation at all. I decided to get another house that was $1000 more, but I was ok with it since I had everything paid for and family from another country was coming. 2 days before the trip I get a cancellation message again about my reservation on the new place. This host was decent enough to tell me that he canceled due to the days I reserved for were already booked. Apparently Airbnb showed available rooms that were not really available. Called customer service and they didn‚Äôt give me any solutions, just sent me listings of places that were already not available or $5000 more in price. Give me a $200 coupon like that was any help at all. I‚Äôm never using this app again and I recommend you do the same.	positive
703	401626263	travel	1	So I signed up and attempted to book for the first time about a year later. In the mean time I had canceled the credit card I signed up with. So I attempted to book but it failed because of the credit card. I got an email, a text and a message through the app telling me it failed. I clicked the link in the email which opened the app but there was no indication of how or where to update the credit card. I finally found it, not in account settings, but (strangely) on the page of the failed booking. There was no option to remove a payment method nor to update a credit card. However there was a button to add a new payment method except the feature would not load. I just got the white page and the little animated dots. I tried restarting the app, restarting the phone, updating the app, and tried it on WiFi and cellular all over the course of about 12 hours. Nothing worked. So I logged into the website. There I found an option to delete a payment method but incredibly there was no option I could find to add a payment method. So I contacted customer service. The replied to my message at 4AM the next day but gave me no helpful information. I replied, but didn‚Äôt hear back from them for three more days. By then I had already booked with a normal hotel which, of course, was no problem. Good riddance Airbnb.	negative
704	401626263	travel	1	"Something is wrong with the search engine airbnb uses. I put in a City and great, there's like 800 places to pick from. Problem is that most of these locations are 30 minutes away from where I actually want to be. As a traveler, this is mostly inconvenient. So then you have to waste your time checking through each posting to see which one is actually close to where you want to be. Please add a distance filter from the city center to fix this mess. Other room finding applications know how to manage distance, so airbnb is way behind.

Aside from that, either the posting is falsified by the host or the engine is misreading metadata, but some city locations at the top, don't match what is on the map. I feel like this must be the host lying about the location to try and get people to go to their location, but airbnb should just pull the city location from the map. If it does already, then it's broken.

Lastly, an enhancement request to the usability. Since I travel to the same place many times, I'm looking at the same locations a lot. Of course I have my favorites, but I'd like an opposite list of locations to avoid. Maybe I read a bad review or the neighborhood was not to my preference, then I don't want to have to figure that out each time I run a search."	negative
705	401626263	travel	1	"I am very disappointed with Airbnb. We had an ant problem in our house, and when I tried to resolve it with the host, she turned on me and blamed us. She said she went above and beyond and that is just not true. Since we didn't think to ""document"" the ants, Airbnb took the hosts' side of the conversation. That is so wrong and has made me never want to use Airbnb again. While the host insulted me as a person and said I was too demanding and minimized what actually happened, Airbnb was no better. They said they had to side with her because I had no pictures. I am sorry but who thinks to take a photo when your hand is covered in ants, and you are just trying to make sure they aren't all over everything you own, which for the record they were. They were in the bed, on my retainer, glasses, clothing, etc. It was one of the most disgusting things I have had to clean. Yes, that's right, we had to clean it because the owner didn't believe in taking a more drastic measure to clean then Windex. Airbnb's customer service was no good either. They made it seem like they empathized with me when they called to hear more information and that they were so sorry, yet they did nothing to rectify the situation. I will never stay with them again.

My fianc√©‚Äôs bday was the other day and he had to travel to Miami for a work trip so we made a family weekend out of it. The hotel we were staying at was over booked so we decided to try to use Air B and B to find something cheaper that was still local. Downloaded the app, set up a profile and picked a place. Confirmed it and were excited out our new reservation. Not even 15 minutes later we get a message saying our reservation was canceled. Called the hotel and they said the never received the payment so we need to contact air B and B. I contacted them and the lady ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt give me any info‚Äù so we waited for a ‚Äúcase manager‚Äù to call back. A couple hours later a women who spoke extremely broken English called and said they were sorry they have to cancel the reservation but we broke the terms and agreements.... which I don‚Äôt know how when we literally set up the profile properly and verified everything! And booked a place AND THEY TOOK THE NEARLY $200 OUT OF OUR ACCOUNT!!!!!!! They would NOT give us a further explanation at all and the lady would not work with us at all and HUNG UP ON ME! Needless to say they put us in an extremely tight bind and we will never use this app ever again. Beware! Seems pretty scamish.	positive
707	401626263	travel	4	So far it‚Äôs been good, but still has some work to be done On the app ect. sometimes the app crashes or takes a while to update. I get messages way later like a day or 2 later on guests asking me questions. I did notice that it has not been sending the check In information to the guests so they get trapped out side the gate for a while because the messages don‚Äôt come in to my phone right when they message. Also I‚Äôve been getting guests having a hard time keeping the booking I get them confirmed and then a day later it‚Äôs canceled on them. Guest call me a lot trying to figure out how to book. Maybe make the booking a little easier. Also if you are in a state that they pay the tax for you make sure to look in to it cause they only pay the state tax not the city tax. Wish they could pay that also each quarter for me. I give Airbnb over all a 4 cause it‚Äôs good just not yet a 5 yet. Work on app a little more and maybe put a system in that is like doc u sign. that way it just automatically sends the booking waver that we need each guest to sign so I don‚Äôt have to do it manually.	positive
708	401626263	travel	1	My family and I are stranded in an unfamiliar state thanks to Airbnb and their unwillingness to correct their mistakes. Thank you for allowing us to book a condo under construction. Thank for allowing us to find this out after thousands of dollars of airfare, time off and hours driving to the booking. Thank you for failing to send any emails or messages informing us of this issue. Thank you for acknowledging the mistake and shooting down any attempt to accommodate my family by booking us a similar listing even though similar listings were available on your app and website. We were forced to deal with horrible customer service representatives. If anyone at the company is reading this please invest in some workshops/training idk maybe a Christmas bonus or something because dealing with your representatives took this experience to another level of frustration. I would not be sitting here writing this essay if it wasn‚Äôt for the young lady I had the pleasure of speaking to last night. Thank you for this experience Airbnb! Who would have thought opening Christmas gifts in rental cars would be so fun! And thanks for the great advice of finding a hotel to accommodate 6 adults on Christmas Eve for 8 days in Orlando. The amount of options were plentiful!!! Thank you! Merry Christmas from our Ford Explorers.	positive
709	401626263	travel	2	Was recently cancelled on for one of our trips. There was absolutely no recourse. I went to your q&a and found out you have a pretty strict set of rules for canceling on the host, but no real strict set of rules on hosts cancelling on guests. This is absolutely horrible. The host only loses the cancellation. The guests lose all that they had invested in the trip - airfare, other places to stay, any reservations and down payments on things like prearranged things or trips such as boating, kayaking, entry fees, etc.  Also I could not leave an Airbnb review on the host. This is absolutely uncalled for. Both the host and Airbnb need to know the consequences of this action. And others need to know that the host cancels on guests.  Airbnb really needs to rethink this policy. If a host cancel, they should be responsible for any costs that the guests incurred. I have heard that hosts will cancel if they get a higher rental fee. Don‚Äôt know if that happened to me, but that should absolutely be forbidden and if one cancellation occurs, the host should be moved to the lowest ranking. They must be discouraged from doing any cancellation.  They have to be running this like a business. The excuse I got was the host had to leave town and could not find someone to clean it before the last guest before me. Really poor excuse!!	negative
710	401626263	travel	5	We used Airbnb during our recent holiday in Kona, HI and stayed in 3 different private units. Each was wonderful and had everything we needed including the loan of beach chairs, beach towels and umbrellas. We didn‚Äôt cook, but each unit was well appointed with everything we would need and next time we will enjoy creating our own meals at the units and eat out less. We enjoyed visiting briefly with each owner, they were all really nice but not intrusive at all. We went on two excursions recommended and booked through Airbnb. They were great and good value. I would recommend the Wild Dolphin & Snorkeling adventure with Captain Chase and the Local Brews & Poke Flights with Lottie and a wonderful chef and fun bartender at a beautiful golf course. They were both awesome and each was a small group of 5-6 people allowing us to ask our hosts questions and visit with the other guests. We will likely use Airbnb more often, it was super easy to book the units, more fun and less expensive than a hotel. When they say ‚ÄòSuper Host‚Äô believe it, book it and relax. I‚Äôm a fan and sharing our experiences with friends. Mahalo!	positive
711	401626263	travel	3	I am traveling for just under a month and am using Air BnB for my travels. I am satisfied with most of my stats so far except one. This particular place was so dingy and run down that I immediately knew I did not want to stay there. Right away I contacted the host asking for the payment of my remaining two nights back so I could secure someplace else. She refused. So I contacted Air BnB and they too so long in figuring things out that I was well on to my next location by the time they said they had successfully negotiated a cleaning fee refund ($34). That was laughable. They told me I could dispute it further and asked me what was a fair compensation. I said that the fairest compensation was the two nights I had originally asked for. That would have been around $270. They negotiated some more and ended up refunding me $120. I am not impressed on the time it takes for them to respond and handle things, nor am I impressed with their negotiation skills. The place I stayed in was a dump and the pictures were a complete lie and they did nothing to fix that for future renters. I‚Äôve now stayed in three other locations and I am very pleased with them. I like Air BnB but I don‚Äôt like their service.	positive
712	401626263	travel	1	If you can find a hotel or anything cheaper at a good price with even mild customer service, do it. Air BnB does NOT care about their customers at all!!! Dealing with Air BnB customer service has been the worst experience I have had with any business/support team. They can check the records and see that their staff AGREED with me and believed I deserved a refund for what was essentially unsafe conditions and poor communication from a host. However, after repeated attempts to receive said refund, they then claimed I had informed them too long after the reservation. They said this a week after my reservation but I had called DURING the first hour of check in for my reservation while I was AT the residence. I wish I had recorded their calls as they do yours, when dealing with customer support, and I would easily have enough evidence to show how they are misleading, careless about customer safety, and how they tell you one thing then flip to a completely different decision without the decency to call you to elaborate. They simply sent a short, rude message on the app. It is sad that they can agree with you (they can go ahead and listen to their recorded phone calls to prove it) and then message you something completely else and ignore the fact that they ever agreed with you. Ridiculous.	negative
713	401626263	travel	1	"Spent multiple days calling or on hold with air bnb after they canceled a trip we booked for Key West. Their website allowed us to rent a unit that was not available. We were charged for the unit, then simply sent a text from another vacation site that our reservation was canceled.  No reason why! No one would tell us why, but it was glitch in air bnb software which no one would own up too.  Every case manager I was assigned too told me they would comp us a stay and send us new listings which never happened.  When a listing was sent it was not comparable to our initial booking.  Each day that passed the cost of the available air bnb units would increase in price, but no one would call me back to confirm another reservation.  Each case worker said they would call me back with in an hour.  No call backs! I am livid with air bnb, there are multiple sites that are a lot cheaper with the same units like VRBO, use them! Don‚Äôt book with this website!!  They are unreliable, they won‚Äôt care if you have a place to stay.

Update..... just received a message from Airbnb. Not a phone call of course.  They are denying telling me they would assist with the cost of another rental and their hands are tied so we should Book another rental. Never again! Hotels would do this to a customer"	negative
714	401626263	travel	1	DO NOT USE AIRBNB. They have the absolute worst customer service. They deactivate accounts for no reason. They say you‚Äôll receive a full refund and I have yet to see any of my money. They owe me more than $1,000... with that said please save your time and your money, don‚Äôt trust these people. My trip is supposed to be in 2 days I‚Äôve had this booked for a month now and they cancelled my reservation and deactivated my account and I was told I‚Äôd receive a FULL refund. As far as the customer service all they say is that they‚Äôll slap a label on it called ‚Äúurgent‚Äù and that they‚Äôll get back to me in 24 hours...got nothing. After I made my SECOND reservation after having my account deactivated, they then accepted my payment and a few minutes later I was told they cancelled my reservation and they‚Äôd send me a full refund I called them to see what was going on and where my money was and all they said to me was that he could do nothing about this, he has to send my case to another department and to ‚Äúrest assured‚Äù it‚Äôll be taken care of In 24 hours and as for my money.. as if it can get any worse I was told that my money is ‚Äútechnically in limbo‚Äù and that I need to contact my bank, contacted the bank and they said they haven‚Äôt gotten anything on their end... AIRBNB WHERE IS MY MONEY!?	positive
715	401626263	travel	3	"Overall, I‚Äôve had good experience with Airbnb, and I like the general set up. I do have two major major issues, and that is 1). with the tax collection. My county and total sales tax are 9%, But they only take out 6% and refuse to fix it. This causes me to lose so much money because I have to take it out of my profit and then file with the county and do my state taxes through an accountant because the system is too complex... Major inconvenience... and 2). This is my 2nd home. I do not want to rent it to just ‚Äúanyone‚Äú. VRBO is better because they at least let you see the person‚Äòs full name, and you can Google their information to make sure they are a real person, etc. There are so
Many scam emails. I have no problem with an AirBNB traveler who has previously had a review, but when a New, unknown person tries to books and gives me no information at all regarding their group or info on their trip, and all I have is a ‚Äúfirst name‚Äù- it‚Äôs unnerving. I think they should try to protect the homeowners much better than what they do right now. It‚Äôs very one-sided towards the renter- where I would like much more of a mutual accountability. Hiding the pictures and last name  is also not OK in my book."	positive
716	401626263	travel	3	"The app presents a little overlay where one can center the photo id capture, but running the app in landscape mode, the overlay was misaligned, with the overlay rectangle half off-screen. And when I disconnected it from the keyboard and rotated the device into portrait orientation, it put the overlay in the right place and everything looked rendered OK, but when I took the photo, it then grabbed the wrong portion of the photo. Bottom line, the photo capture got thoroughly confused with iPad in landscape orientation (which if you have a keyboard attached, is how we generally use these things). And when I first oriented the device into portrait, I happened to do upside-down portrait orientation (which iPads permit) and then the captured photo was upside down. Lol.

But when I backed out, put my iPad in portrait orientation, and tried to capture the photo again, it worked fine. The problem seems to be limited to when you enter the photo capture while the iPad is in landscape orientation.

This is all pretty minor stuff in an otherwise quite polished app, but I thought I‚Äôd bring this to your attention as this is apparently and use-case that slipped by anyone‚Äôs attention."	negative
717	401626263	travel	3	"Very nice App. Easy to book and communicate with host. But (the current version) could use some bug fixes. I use the App on my iPad Pro with the most recent iOS an when I scroll through my search results, the movement is extremely slowly, sometimes gets even stuck. Something is wrong here. Search filters are also not perfect. When I set for example my limit at $200 per night, the App shows me also accommodations above $200. Also, it would be great if the location filter would be narrower. If I search for housing in a certain town I don‚Äòt want to see housing from near-by towns. Unfortunately, one sometimes only find out once you check the map, because the title often does not tell the location. Maybe adding a distance option would help (how far from target destination the search should be expanded). 

Additional comment: What I also dont like is that I cant remove my credit card information from my account after payment (not through the App and also not through the online account). I wished they would support Apple Pay. I don‚Äòt like to keep my credit card information all over the internet."	positive
718	401626263	travel	1	What a scam! DO NOT BOOK THIS!!!! It IS A SCAM!!! Unresponsive host ruined my trip to DC and made us late to the event we were in DC to attend. We tried to contact the host for check in instructions, and she did not respond, leaving us with no place to stay. We then had to scramble and find a friend to stay with after we no longer had a place to stay after we reached out to the host Tracy multiple times, via Airbnb messenger and phone, and eventually had to call Airbnb guest relations. The person on the phone (listed on the Airbnb as the host) said they were not the host and I had the wrong number. This is also on the shoulders of Airbnb, because of their negligence I did not know that there were several others who had similar experiences over the last couple months. I asked the very nice non-US based call center employee for an actual management response from Airbnb within 24 hours and never received the call. Airbnb offered nothing in reparations for their role in this issue, considering they have 4 other people who endured similar experiences and yet they gave no sanctions to this terrible host, and they gave me no warning about these issues they have known about for OVER 2 MONTHS, and therefore will be hearing from our attorney shortly for their negligence.	negative
719	401626263	travel	1	I‚Äôve had nothing but problems trying to make a reservation through Airbnb. My first reservation was cancelled due to me not completeing the verification process in time(long story short my account was set to eastern time instead of pacific time) I verified my account no big deal, I called customer service and was instructed to try and re-book, assured that my reservation would go through I did. I then received an email saying I needed to complete the verification process however when I clicked the link in the email I was taken to a page that said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all set‚Äù and a button on the bottom saying ‚Äúfinish‚Äù I clicked the finish button and was taken to the home screen I assumed there was a glitch in the software somewhere. Three hours later I received an email saying my reservation was cancelled a second time for not completing the verification process in time. I was very confused as I had in fact completed the process and was not given an option to do anything further from the links in their emails. Now I‚Äôm being told by customer service to re-book my trip for a third time. I‚Äôm unsure if this is how they typically do business but I‚Äôve received little to no help from their customer service team or the case manager assigned to help fix my problem.	negative
720	401626263	travel	1	Airbnb did not refund any money for a situation that was out of my hands. I was studying abroad in Rome and planning to visit Barcelona from March 5-9, staying at an AirBnb rental. Our school mandated that we return to America on March 2nd due to the rising threat of Coronavirus, so we had no choice but to leave and could not attend our stay in Barcelona as planned. We lost all the money that we had put into this trip, even though it was not our fault. After contacting AirBnb support staff, they were not sympathetic at all towards our situation and they closed our case. We sent them all the right documentation that showed that we were forced to leave, but they did not care. Even with the credit card company involved, AirBnb still did not help us and we have not gotten any money back. We are students, so we don‚Äôt have a lot of money to begin with, and to lose that much money really is detrimental. I would have hoped that a huge corporation like AirBnb would be able to see that we are not at fault and that it‚Äôs unfair to take our money without giving some sort of refund, considering our safety was at stake. I will think twice before ever using this app and company ever again, because they definitely put their own greed before the needs of their customers.	negative
721	401626263	travel	2	"Never had an issue using the app. However the company needs some work. A friend of mine created a group for us to look at cabins to rent, thus making them the ‚Äòtrip owner‚Äô, even though all they did was invite us to a group to share destinations with each other. We find one we all like, and I book it with my card. 

Fast forward a few months, now it‚Äôs March and our trip starts April 17th. Our flights get canceled due to COVID-19. I log on to Airbnb to cancel our trip because we have no intent of traveling if the airlines deem it a heath risk, nor do we plan to drive 15 hours each way for a weekend trip. NOPE. Airbnb is only allowing trips between March 14 - April 14 to get a full refund due to COVID-19. 

So I call hoping a representative can assist more than the app. After waiting over an hour on hold I am informed I cannot cancel the reservation because I am not the ‚Äòtrip owner‚Äô... EVEN THOUGH ITS MY CARD ON THE RESERVATION. Whatever, I‚Äôll just add them to the call so they don‚Äôt have to wait an hour on hold. Nope. Won‚Äôt allow it for account safety concerns.... it‚Äôs my account, they‚Äôre my friend, I‚Äôm not concerned and we‚Äôre certainly not waiting another hour on hold just to be told they can‚Äôt give a full refund."	positive
722	401626263	travel	1	The worst experience EVER with their support team I have ever experienced. Recently rented a property in Puerto Rico of course you must pay in full, no problem excepting my money but when we arrived at the property it was nothing less than a dump not at all what the photos that were posted for the listing showed. Mold on the walls, floors, shower, smelly bedding, dirt dust missing floor tiles in the kitchen that expose the concrete below , a junkyard of a front yard, spiderwebs, clutter..... we could not even spend one night there. when I submitted the photos to THE AIR BNB they were passed on to three different individual case workers to who agreed that the place was disgusting and did not match the listing but she was not authorized so she transferred me to someone above her who never spoke to me once and ruled in favor of the host Who argued that this property was clean and nothing was wrong with it! which is completely inaccurate! In the end they are keeping our money and we did not spend one single night there this is for 14 days that they will gladly steel from their customers knowing that the place was A step above a rundown shack you may find crackheads squatting in. Airbnb might find them selves regretting to ignore the mold in the photos Porter Rico is part of America	negative
723	401626263	travel	2	"Going on over a year now, and confirmed it with a newer phone, the PUSH NOTIFICATIONS DON‚ÄôT APPEAR  half the time, if not less. (I.e the app badge, and banners). There were periods where was missing responses and threatening my response time stats because the app simply wasn‚Äôt notifying me that a message or inquiry has been received. Yes I‚Äôve checked all the notification settings in the phone and app, and yes I‚Äôve re-downloaded the app a handful of times. Still the app seems to spontaneously choose when to notify me of stuff. The work around is turning on texts and email as means of communication, but frustrating since now I‚Äôm forced to basically have triple versions of any given message, just to be safe I‚Äôve mentioned this on the phone to them, but no real solutions were made obvious to me. 

Other stuff: The app is persistently brings up a ‚Äúnetwork error‚Äù message when the network is totally fine, and it tends to find itself blocking some important button I need to press. The calendar in host mode always seems to automatically load to a month or two earlier than the present day, so you have to scroll every time, just annoying really."	negative
724	401626263	travel	3	"I enjoy all the features of this app. In fact I like all of the app with one gigantic exception‚Ä¶ The calendar inconsistently works.  What I mean is when you open up your Airbnb app and you want to look at your calendar about 50% of the time it just hangs and will not open. All other features work but if you want to know who‚Äôs coming on what day your calendar won‚Äôt be helpful since half the time it doesn‚Äôt load. It doesn‚Äôt matter what phone you‚Äôre on it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre on an iPad it doesn‚Äôt matter what computer‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve called over and over about this especially after seeing so many other people having the same issue. As a host it‚Äôs really inconvenient to not be able to see who is booking on what dates. Despite a history of this is a major issue for people, it‚Äôs still not fixed years later. So so annoying.

PS‚Ä¶ Only fix I‚Äôve been able to find is you have to shut the device completely off and power back on. Sometimes that‚Äôll bring your calendar back up otherwise Airbnb doesn‚Äôt seem to think this is a big deal that the calendar doesn‚Äôt show up for the host about half the time."	negative

Not one bad experience. The places that we have stayed have been clean, friendly.... just exactly what we needed for where we were and what we‚Äôre doing. Again, as a host, I enjoy sharing my hometown with visitors and making them feel comfortable and welcome while enjoying the area. The extra money has been greatly appreciated as we live in an expensive area. Now with my husband retired, I am able to help with our expensive taxes and utilities, not to mention my health insurance which is extremely expensive since I am no longer covered by my husband‚Äôs employment. I am grateful for the opportunity to be able to contribute and be creative as a host at the same time, 

I give Airbnb my highest recommendation and appreciation to Airbnb and what this wonderful company stands for and look forward to a long and rewarding relationship as a Super Host and a guest. Thank you so much, Airbnb!"	positive
726	401626263	travel	1	Confusing app..  Great service until you run into the most minor issue.  I tried to modify a reservation and it turned into a complete nightmare of phone call after phone call with Patricia where I had to explain, reexplain and then explain again a very simple issue.  She claimed she needed to verify with the host and claimed she couldn‚Äôt reach him which was bizarre since the host said he never heard from her and was nothing but accommodating and responsive to me the entire trip.  I would recommend going directly to your host with any modifications or extensions of your trip or you‚Äôll find yourself on the phone with Airbnb your entire trip, completely frustrated.  While she was nice she didn‚Äôt seem like she listened to a word I said. Now they continue to keep trying to take money for days I didn‚Äôt stay.  She claims she can‚Äôt reach the host but he‚Äôs a well respected doctor and we have mutual friends who are his neighbors so I‚Äôm inclined to believe his side of the story.  I would try home away vacation app instead (although I‚Äôve never used, it but will be now). My family has properties listed on Airbnb and we will now be trying Home Away Vacation app instead as we don‚Äôt want or guests to have the same poor experience on their getaway.	positive

The bathrooms were sparkling clean. The house is located one minute away from Cincinnati. It‚Äôs extremely clean and very well appointed. The hostess takes great care in providing that immaculate home away from home comfort. Everything you need for a stay away. Kitchen well stocked with clean utensils, more than enough ample amenities all around. 
The interior renovation of this sweet little cottage is even better than it looks in the photos.
So clean and a fresh feeling. Love the decor and  back porch. Close to the highways, the neighborhood felt very safe, relatively quiet.
I felt very secure there was also another female traveler, I had a wonderful time! Everything I needed was included in the house plus lots of extras. Thanks for hosting this space, I will definitely stay here again!"	positive

I excepted the request and Airbnb gave the green light, I‚Äôm assuming to make sure the funds were available. That was on the Thursday they stay Friday which was the extra day and then checked out Saturday I got a email Friday morning at 1:30 in the morning saying the funds were not available. I then contacted Airbnb via email and the representative was saying if she could attempt to get the payment she tried she called then ask me if I would be willing to call the guest which I wasn‚Äôt at first then I decided that I could still reach out with a pleasant message long story short I got the payment through speaking with the guest. I asked to speak with the supervisor after messaging for four days waiting for the payment. The supervisor  called me back after the fact after I‚Äôd already retrieve the money and I feel like Airbnb wasn‚Äôt going to  reimbursed me.  I repeatedly asked the representative to reimburse me and then go collect it from the guest instead of putting me in the middle and I got nowhere I had to do it myself.	positive

However, after two days and no reply, I contacted customer service and they said they could not help me and my account would be assigned to a case manager who would get back to me ‚Äúshortly‚Äù to resolve my problem. Slightly irritating but still understandable. Two more days passed and I called customer service again and received the same reply, however they stated that they would get back to me within 48 hours from my original call. So now, 4 days have passed and still no reply and my case was not assigned to anyone. I waited another two days with still no response and had to find another site to book with as time was running out. NOW, OVER 3 WEEKS LATER, my vacation over with, I still have received no communication from Air B&B and my account is still locked, not even allowing me to look at the website. As, the company has grown you would thing they would expand their customer service, but apparently do not care to. Will not be using this service (as if I had a choice) in the future. There are better services out there.	negative
731	401626263	travel	1	"I understand this is a review of the app - but would like to share my recent experience with Airbnb. A host left a review on my profile that was sexist and disgusting. Despite my entire history of perfectly treating Airbnb‚Äôs, the company refused to acknowledge the comment was sexist - conveniently, the two hosts were men and only acknowledged my partner (male), yet attacked me in the review. The Airbnb correspondent handling the case was also a man, who told me it was not discriminatory in his opinion.

I hope Airbnb will focus more on customer service and experience, because this is disappointing after years of supporting this company. Men shouldn‚Äôt be deciding what is and isn‚Äôt sexist.

But, to make this legitimate to the app, it‚Äôs pretty buggy. The messaging app will frequently triple or quadruple sending me messages or not send them at all, and leaves illegal Airbnb‚Äôs listed (as I‚Äôve experienced then having them canceled as it was not legally listed, or having an uncomfortable experience getting to an Airbnb and finding it is illegal due to city laws). I‚Äôve gotten to the booking stages before only to have errors, despite the space still being available. Usually takes several tries before it actually goes through."	negative
732	401626263	travel	1	"With an understanding that COVID-19 has swept the nation, I understand Airbnb‚Äôs going through an influx of cancellations. That being said, the department of defense has issued a travel ban extending through June 30th. My fianc√© and I had to cancel our wedding and flights to Florida and Hawaii due to this travel bad, as we are part of the military community. The venue and airlines, were understanding and provided us full compensation due to these troubling times. 

Airbnb on the other hand refuses to acknowledge the department of defense‚Äôs travel ban, and will not give us our money back. They do not have the decency to pick up a phone and talk, it is strictly through automated messages. If we are legally unable to travel outside of a 2-hour radius of our home...how do they expect us to fly cross country or across the Pacific Ocean? Let alone be charged upwards of $6,000 for a vacation we will not be attending? I am appalled and disheartened by the way Airbnb has chosen to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. I will never use their services again, and I suggest you don‚Äôt either. The company is clearly unable to withstand a large scale disaster, and my money is more important to them than valuing customers on a basic human level. I am utterly disgusted."	negative
733	401626263	travel	1	If you‚Äôre planning on hosting you need to make sure you don‚Äôt use Airbnb! They‚Äôre the worst for helping you out. They don‚Äôt take the full amount from the guest and leave you hanging dry whenever there‚Äôs a payment issue. If they‚Äôre going to sit back and collect money from service charges, occupancy taxes, etc. they should also collect full payments from guests and release them as the dates approach. I had a issue with a guest staying 2 months and not paying anything the 2nd month. When I asked Airbnb about non payment they said they tried to collect and there was an issue with that. The guest ended up leaving in the middle of the night, stole numerous things, and didn‚Äôt pay. When I reached out to Airbnb they said they‚Äôd look into it. I had to do a reverse number search and come to find out this guest that was staying was defrauding people. AIRBNB Does a terrible job of actually filtering who‚Äôs using their platform. This lady has been convicted of nurse impersonation and battery and assault. Only reason I was able to find her actual last name was because I did my research. Stay away from Airbnb! They‚Äôre not there to help you at all. They haven‚Äôt even responded to me. It‚Äôs been a week!	negative

I set foot inside and realized the the bedroom light didn‚Äôt work and it was pitch black besides the flashlight on my phone. The front door wouldn‚Äôt close correctly unless you turned the deadbolt. Just ridiculous and smelly. Immediately called Airbnb for a refund and they responded amazingly. I provided pictures and video of the place and got a full refund and the host‚Äôs privileges were revoked. They also set me up with hotel accommodations for the night as it was late and no other Airbnb‚Äôs were available until the next morning. I spoke with the same person every single time which made customer service amazing because i didn‚Äôt have to retell my story and explain myself to a new person. The CS manager called me and emailed me within a very timely manner. It was all resolved in about 2 hours! I‚Äôm very happy with the service and will continue to use Airbnb.	positive

I made a somewhat last minute reservation (1 week in advance) I was asked to pay additional money for tax direct to the host ($200+) None of the payment methods worked and no one answered the phone. Uncomfortable with the reservation I moved to cancel it. I was informed I would only receive $250 or the $1900 payment. Even though a booked it 24 hours earlier. I called Air BB support. Was put on hold for several minutes then told they would call me back. After 4 hours I sent a message which was answered shortly afterwards informing me that I would receive a call soon. 4 days later I called again. I was told that the payment request needs to go through Air BB platform and that the reservation could not be cancelled. Now stuck with a reservation I‚Äôm not happy with, I‚Äôm being forced to pay and move forward or forfeit $1700. I‚Äôve had good experiences using this service but the last two bookings were not good. USE AT YOUR OWN RUSK! If the host is shady, Air BB cannot and will not help you resolve it to your satisfaction. Only the satisfaction of the faceless host. In this case a vacation company. Who never gave me a point of contact that actually worked.	negative

After booking a room for a week and the Host ACCEPTED my request AND payment; I contacted the host to receive instructions on how to enter the home and the host tells me the room is NOT available. The host then lies to the representative and tells them he said no such thing. The Representatives all (3) that I have spoken with all had NASTY attitudes and could not accommodate me for the POOR excuses and services that AIR BNB provides. Now I‚Äôm stuck outside in the cold with my children due to the negligence and poor services that this company provides. This is not the first time that this situation has occurred through Air BNB.I blame Air BNB for allowing people like Vic to continue to provide services and I Blame Air BNB For not allowing their customers whom spend their hard earned money to feel as though We are respected. They treated me like Trash and I would really hate to see someone else end up in a situation as such. So before booking with this company please weigh your options. They will give you a complete run around and there would be nothing you can do. It‚Äôs 30 degrees outside and now my only option is to wait on God. God bless America	negative
737	401626263	travel	5	Airbnb has become my exclusive Hosted Listing Website for 6 years! I have tried others too, plus have my own website. Air is my favorite and most dependable Hosted website! I love Air because: Customer service works, my guests are screened-quality people, Pay always drops into my business account, I can apply my listings information and photos via my phone app, and I have enough guests to keep me happy!  I am older and disabled. Air and with outside help, and my dependable guests gave me hope and have saved my real estate property from being foreclosed. Their business I believe has saved my life and given me a chance to get back on my feet and be able to pay taxes again. Air is good for the US, State, local and citizen‚Äôs economy. Most of all.. my over 200 reviews tell the world that travelers like the idea of being able chose variety and unique spaces to relax at. But no competition can beat out Air‚Äôs experience providing quality app and customer service! Air is Super!!	positive
738	401626263	travel	1	"There is other places that do this same thing with better customer service. Think about it, do you want to rent from a hotel that you can‚Äôt call? Nope! Also I have to beware of scammers as they don‚Äôt check all the listed places out. 
I rented an apartment at a nice place and asked if I could extend by one day, they said yes so I asked if I can check out at the regular time and owe nothing since they hadn‚Äôt taken the money yet. My job called and said they needed me at the start of COVID pandemic. The apartment said yes, all the way home I was trying to correct it online and had no one to call so only messaging them. Wanderjaunt said I had to call Airbnb, Airbnb said I had to call Wanderjaunt and it went back and forth numerous times till I gave up! A month later the money came off my friends card!!! In middle of pandemic!! I message air bnb who said I had to request money back from wander and wait 72 hours till I could then involve air bnb. No response so I involved air bnb who said my host denied it and nothing they can do. I contact Wanderjaunt direct and they say they would help if air bnb contacted them. So air bnb never did they just denied it smfh!! Never again!! I give up! Go to a hotel!!!"	positive

When I got to the site where I finally do the confirmation it kept saying it wouldn‚Äôt except my card. When I got in touch with someone at Airbnb they said it was likely due to a problem with my bank. When I called the bank they explained to me that there was absolutely no charge from Airbnb and there would be no reason for them to refuse it so there‚Äôs no problem on their end. The guy at the bank told me he had issues trying to set up an account with Airbnb as well. The lady I was communicating with told me multiple times she had no idea what was going on and that they would never hold my credit card account for any reason. But when I finally downloaded the app and was able to create a profile apparently that was the hold up. In addition to that they didn‚Äôt want my credit card number and they did keep it on file. What a mess.  50 minutes later I finally have a place that would have taken 5 minutes on VBRO.	neutral
740	401626263	travel	1	"Are you saying that it‚Äôs okay to let a verified Airbnb guest book 3 unverified/unregistered guests that do not have an account with Airbnb?  

Here is an example of what I‚Äôm dealing with as a host right now. Airbnb doesn‚Äôt show anything about the person except 1 review which may or may not be prefabricated. We know nothing about the people. It‚Äôs endangering people‚Äôs lives. We used to host so many awesome people from various cultures and backgrounds and made good money doing it, but now Airbnb has changed the way they do things based on the grounds of racism. You take one good hard look at all my guests that I‚Äôve hosted and tell me again if we deserve to be labeled potential racists. We accept people of all races and backgrounds. The only people we have zero tolerance for are people that act like they could harm us, and if potential guests are rude and disrespectful or over demanding and have poor follow-though in their communication. Airbnb‚Äôs current policies have ruined a wonderful technology that connects people. Like the old saying goes, ‚Äúlisten to your gut feeling‚Äù. If you feel unsafe and uncertain, don‚Äôt take the chance of hosting someone that could potentially place your family at risk."	negative
741	401626263	travel	1	If I could rate this 0 star, I would have. My friends and I have been planning to book this specific room, and when we finally saved up, I tried to book it. My account was all set up, and when I booked it, it kept on giving me a ‚Äúfailed verification.‚Äù I sent a clear picture of my state ID and a clear picture of myself to have that verification cleared up. So I tried many times to book it, but it just wouldn‚Äôt go through. An hour later, I got an email saying that they couldn‚Äôt tell if I was the person on MY OWN ID. So I tried to get this cleared up asap and sent another verification. It takes them hours to verify. The beach house my friends and I have been saving up for is now booked by someone else, only because of this horrible app and how slow their process takes. I tried to keep in touch with the host of the house, but the host could not help me with this problem. It is impossible to contact the customer service, because it is not on their site. They expect you to get ALL of your answers from the Help Center, even though it DOES NOT provide everything. This leaves us no choice but to pay a grand for expensive hotel here in Hawaii. HORRIBLE APP	negative
742	401626263	travel	3	"Customer Service= not trained well on policy. If you have an issue, ask for a manager. 
Gift Cards= never buy one. You cannot apply a gift card in certain scenarios. Such as split payments. I tried to apply a gift card to my reservation when booking. There was no option for partial gift card payment + credit card payment. I could only split the payment in which now Airbnb restricts me from using the rest of my gift card per their policy. 
Coupons= I received a coupon after complaining about a bad host experience. Great, it‚Äôs still sitting in my account and I couldn‚Äôt apply it to my reservation because again, Airbnb doesn‚Äôt have the capability to allow multiple payment methods. I couldn‚Äôt apply both a coupon and a gift card.
So now I have to book 2 more trips in order to use my gift card & my coupon credit. 
I‚Äôve had pretty good luck on the properties themselves but the app needs improvements and customer policies need to be easy to use and would likely promote their gift cards if they weren‚Äôt so restricting."	positive
743	401626263	travel	5	Initially, Airbnb had many problems. Among them was poor customer service support. Recently, through their Twitter account, I receive nearly immediate responses to my Owner questions and problems. Yay! Their Service fees to guest have been higher than other sites like VRBO, however from an owner standpoint, they are currently not charging a 3% transaction fee on credit card and e checks that VRBO is charging, which significantly reduces owner profitability. They also do not have a screwy algorithm like VRBO that can significantly reduce visibility and page views. My only suggestion at this point to AirBNB is to include local and state taxes in the calculations for guest stays. These are now frequently required nearly everywhere and create confusion for guests in either having to post higher rental rates to include the taxes, or a surprise after renting that taxes are due by the guest. I have sincerely enjoyed working with AirBNB and have found the guests who have stayed to be informed, responsible and communicative.	positive
744	401626263	travel	1	biggest and worst mistake I‚Äôve made in my vacation booking process. All I hear are great things about these beautiful home, and everyone‚Äôs quick to look into Airbnb. I booked two different homes for my husband and I. My payment wasn‚Äôt denied when originally booking these places. BUT to complete my payment (pay the other half of my booking) my card is continuously declined. This is only after the host told me to cancel my entire trip I order to add ONE date. I‚Äôve lost money, time. Airbnb is no help whatsoever and told me to just ‚Äúkeep trying‚Äù to make this payment. No one has apologized. No courtesy. Nothing. And my host continues to threaten to cancel my trip because my ‚Äúpayment isn‚Äôt being made‚Äù. If I cancel now I‚Äôll lose 200+$$ never again. Hotels for now on. Update:: the second location we had booked for 6 days from now was just canceled by the host. No Airbnb‚Äôs in our price range are available anymore. And for a group of five a hotel is going to be double. Airbnb is a disaster. Ruined our entire trip, and literally profited off of it. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone using this app, website or company until they make some serious changes to their policies and customer service.	negative
745	401626263	travel	1	"In principal, I am a fan of AIRBNB. But, two recent bad customer support experiences have left me down on the app. I booked a place in May and the description and detailed directions sent were problematic, ultimately making it impossible to get to cabin via undisclosed ferry on holiday weekend. The host and AIRBNB were not helpful at all. The host changed the listing as this was going on. Despite my sending details including copies of screenshots showing problems and texts with just, AIRBNB not only refunded nothing but simply stopped communicating with me. Unfortunately, I had already booked a cabin in Montana and just learned I need surgery. I am getting bare minimum
Back from host. She is refusing to do more. And, I cannot figure out how to effectively deal with AIRBNB‚Äôs resolution center which failed me in May but promises relief for things like medical emergencies. It is all s joke. They will refund nothing. I obviously will never use again. Tread cautiously unless your plans are imminent or in stone. Regardless, one would think they would offer some type of travel insurance, but no...Must make more money ripping people off. No more business from me"	negative
746	401626263	travel	1	Airbnb as a publicly traded company is not mature with regards to its hosting functionality and support.  There have been multiple instances where I have been woefully unsupported as a host.  For instance, when a user made a stay extension request hours before scheduled check-out, with a declined credit card...airbnb granted the extension and requested that the host sort out the payment issue with the user...then airbnb charged the host $100 for ‚Äúhost canceling‚Äù the reservation that technically already ended, stating that they don‚Äôt have the functionality to cancel an extension specifically.  Or when my listing required an additional person charge, which a user lied to get around, not considering that the host checks guests in personally, and often hosts can count. In this instance, airbnb again said there‚Äôs nothing they can do, and that the host had to pursue the discrepancy with the user directly. And at the tail end of it, when the user writes an angry review that obviously impacts future profitability, airbnb refused to take it down..  If other hosts have had similar experiences and have suffered losses due to airbnb‚Äôs inept management and lack of accountability, there may be remedies to pursue collectively!	negative
747	401626263	travel	4	"The app is continually being improved which is good, but there are two issues I wish they would fix/modify. I‚Äôve made over 50 bookings in the last 3 years so I have used the app a lot. 
One, actual prices are always 20-45% above the ‚ÄúTotal price breakdown‚Äù shown on the top page because cleaning/service/tax fees are not included.  To compare actual prices requires a lot of navigating back and forward.  
Two, personal filter preferences are not saved which makes a new search a bit more difficult, or worse, I have to go back and forth because something or other is not clear or I‚Äôm trying to compare different places and the filters default back to showing a different set of options which can bring up, for example, studio apts instead of the 2br apts I had previously been looking for.  One booking cost me an extra $100 because my filter of 2 people was defaulted back to 1 person which I didn‚Äôt notice until the host met me at the apartment."	negative

The airbnb ‚Äúsupport‚Äù team was no help at all they basically told me the host had the right to rob me for 2 nights... Never use this app unless you like to just blow money.

749	401626263	travel	4	"In short: 
I would like total of trip to be the default, and i would like a single person to be counted as a whole person and not half a couple. Put bed count and sofa count in different fields or readily available for selection in options.

In long form:
This app counts people as couples to a default, it would be nice if i didn‚Äôt have to put 3 people when there are only 2 just for the app to show me situations where there are at least two places to sleep, or to show places with two actual beds and not a bed and a couch. I recently had to do this traveling with a couple and two singles - (and am doing it again with a different trip). I have to bump out the search to 5 people to find at least three beds. Searching takes longer and is disappointing. Because the $ amount has to be increased just to see 3 bed (not just couch) situations that are actually 2 beds and a couch. You‚Äôre looking at amazing places out of budget to find something in budget - so it is set up to disappoint. Each spot i have to scroll through to see if, for four people, it means 2 beds, or 2 beds and a sofa, or one bed and two sofas. 

The app also requires the dates i‚Äôm looking for, so why give only a per night charge in the preview? And require me to hit book to see the total after all the itemized charges? I would rather see the total on the map, or at the bottom as i look at pictures to make it easier to see if i'm within budget."	positive
750	1065781769	social	4	I downloaded houseparty maybe two years ago and one of the great things about it is you get the chance to talk to people you wouldn‚Äôt usually talk to or call on purpose and you make a lot of new friends this way. One of my best friends to this day I would‚Äôve never thought of talking to if it hadn‚Äôt been for houseparty. It‚Äôs a great app overall the only reason it lost that star was because of what it did with streaks. It started off cool like you and your friends would try to rack up minutes and because it was every five days in circumstances where they couldn‚Äôt be on house party I felt it was a good amount of time to give. But then they began decreasing it to three and then two days which means you basically have to be on the app everyday in order to keep your minutes or streak or whatever. It‚Äôs not really the fact that minutes and aesthetic were lost but more of the passive aggressive way to keep people on the app. Minutes were one out of many of my motivations to go back to the app knowing i had a good amount of time, but now there‚Äôs no motivation if you‚Äôre just going to lose them every two days. But overall it is still a very good app and helpful in making new friends	positive
751	1065781769	social	5	I think that Houseparty is an amazing app. It allows you to video chat with more than one of your friends easily. You can message your friends through the app, which I find very convenient. Speaking of friends, on the app somebody has to request to be your friend, so thistles the app slightly more private then it already is. The quality of the video is very good. Houseparty has the same qualities as the app ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù and more. You can play games with your friend that the app serves to you while on a call with your friend. You can make group conversations on the messaging part of the app. And to wrap it up, you can call other friends that are on the app, from the app, and you can also just do an audio call. There are many more great things about housparty that I can‚Äôt fit into one review. So I definitely recommend this app for any age group. (It is not at all inappropriate or to mature for anyone that is able to use ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù or ‚ÄúMessages‚Äù). The app is very accommodating!!! And awesome!!	positive
752	1065781769	social	5	First of all, I don‚Äôt know why people are complaining? Ok, I have lots of friends that don‚Äôt have phones and I can‚Äôt talk to them, but with Houseparty I can! Sometimes I want to video chat with multiple people at the same time but I can‚Äôt do that with FaceTime. I can with Houseparty! There are little things here in there but I love this app! One time these two people would not stop calling me and anytime I would come on they would join me, but you can sneak onto Houseparty. See, anytime you go onto the app your friends get a notification, but there is a way to sneak on, so your friends don‚Äôt get a notification. Also, they give you really cool facts on the home screen, one time I spent hours just looking at the facts! Lastly, if you don‚Äôt like getting notifications every time one of your friends comes on, there is a way to do turn it off. Overall, I love this app and I don‚Äôt know why more people are using this app. It‚Äôs a great app to download and I recommend this app to anyone!	positive
753	1065781769	social	4	I know this app is supposed to be about fun and seeing a lot of people at one time. But I want the developers to know that you gave my family something that is truly irreplaceable. My uncle got sick suddenly and was placed in the hospital on ICU. I have a HUGE family and a lot of us are spread apart in different states. Houseparty allowed us who couldn‚Äôt be there physically to be there virtually during precious moments. We were able to say our last goodbyes, hear funny stories, comfort one another, and be there for his final breath. Death is not fun but this app was one piece of making it a little more bearable because we were literally able to be there for one another. Even on different time zones, doing different things, we were all there. That is something that we are all thankful for and will never forget. We literally said to each other how perfect it was that we found this app and got everyone connected a month ago, not even knowing that it would be a necessity during this tragic time. So thank you.	positive
754	1065781769	social	2	it‚Äôs alright when it works but it doesn‚Äôt even come close to comparing to Zoom, Duo, FaceTime, etc. with AirPods, the latency is so bad that you would hear a response until at least 2 full seconds have passed. the quality leaves much to be desired. the was frequent feedback on the call, meaning that it has issues with noise-cancellation (which other video calling apps have no issues with). it‚Äôs inefficient and drains my battery like no other. the video quality honestly was pretty good but the voice quality was subpar. an hour into the call we got kicked and couldn‚Äôt join each other again. we spent 30mins trying to call them and them calling me and we‚Äôd select ‚Äújoin‚Äù but our efforts were futile because it never worked. eventually we just gave up. not to sound like a Karen with the hard R but i‚Äôm so disappointed in this app. i ended up deleting it after the first use. also, part of me thinks that privacy isn‚Äôt at all a concern of theirs (i should read the privacy policy yes i know) so i‚Äôm even afraid that having the app installed is going to lead to me getting hacked and locked out of my accounts	negative
755	1065781769	social	3	"My friends and I were mid playing last night at around 12 am when the app crashed. It started to lag on all ends and we couldn‚Äôt even try to video chat with each other because we weren‚Äôt showing up on our personal friend list even though we were all waiting for each other the whole time. It wasn‚Äôt loading. My friend uninstalled and reinstalled and no changes happened. It started to work 30-40 minutes later. We were all annoyed and wondering what was happening.

Also, in the games, cards and words constantly repeat which looses excitement in the game. We all kept saying ‚Äúwait! We just did this!‚Äù And as for the Karaoke Night, they were all older songs that majority barely knew. We were expecting more current songs from 90s - current times. It seemed to be opposite. 

This game is definitely bringing people together especially during this quarantine, but it definitely needs some improvement. I was trying to find the ‚Äúhelp‚Äù section to see what I can do, but couldn‚Äôt. Let time heal itself."	positive
756	1065781769	social	4	House party is a great way to hang out with ALL of your friends at any time! I‚Äôd call for hours, and we always have great connection wherever we are. The games are great- my friend group loves the game Chips and Guac! We played forever, and our answers always made us laugh. However, I do find one thing that may be useful for some. In some situations, you want to call but can‚Äôt because you have to be quiet at night or while someone‚Äôs working. I‚Äôve had to decline calling my friends because of this. I think that adding a chat to be available (when needed) on the side of the screen would be helpful to people like me!! Then, we‚Äôd be able to chat without others hearing us. I‚Äôd be simple for the others to see, and reply to. We could have headphones in listening to our other friend(s) and still be a part of the conversation, all while nobody knows!

Sorry, but the truth is that years ago this app was much better than now. If y‚Äôall can‚Äôt fix the app there‚Äôs no point of giving it promotion or making people download it.

I understand that ""best friends"" are gained onto your profile based off of how much time you speak to specific people, but i also believe that best friends should also be gained by if you pass a lot of notes/ texts to a specific person on the app. Because alot of times i cant physically cant speaküó£ to someone over the app whether its because im on lunch break at training or im at a family event, or im at a loud place, etc. which is why i use the ""Pass A Note"" feature, and i would like to gain best friends over that feature too. I talked to my friends about the suggestion and they all agreed and said they had the same exact thought.

     It gets annoying when the app thinks I didn‚Äôt see the last four ‚Äúin the house‚Äù notifications for one person. I‚Äôve had times when one of my friends is on a call with some other people and my phone tells me ten times that that person is on the app. Thank you, but I saw it the first time.

     This is a great app, but please try to fix it so it doesn‚Äôt tell me ‚Äúthey‚Äôre in the house! they‚Äôre in the house! you moron, LOOK!‚Äù It‚Äôs very annoying. Other than that, I think it‚Äôs absolutely fantastic and I will use it for a very long time."	positive

I downloaded this app on both devices just in case my ipod died viceversa. But this glitch was effective to BOTH MY DEVICES. At that point, I gave up. I thought it was my wifi or something else. I tried going in EVERY SINGLE ROOM IN MY HOUSE. Still didn‚Äôt work. So I decided to use a different app to talk to my friends. This app is WONDERFUL and it has connected many people who live far away from each other, but it just didn‚Äôt work for me. I would LOVE to use this app again, but my electronics or the app won‚Äôt permit me with that glitch. This is the ONLY reason why I gave this a 3-star review.

762	1065781769	social	3	So, I gave Houseparty a 3star review because they were always sending me notifications to sign up with Facebook. I‚Äôm to young for Facebook and I don‚Äôt like it. Making something do something they don‚Äôt want to is not appropriate. Second, it doesn‚Äôt work if you don‚Äôt have WiFi........? what if you want to talk with your family members as a group in one chat and you can‚Äôt because you don‚Äôt have WiFi. It‚Äôs very annoying how apps don‚Äôt let you play or do things on it without WiFi. It‚Äôs very annoying, and for me growing up with not that much WiFi in my household, it really annoys me of how I always have to have it. Third, the app will also don‚Äôt work if you have slow WiFi. What I meant with growing up with not that much WiFi in my household, I meant it was very slow. Sure now it fast but still. What about other people. They just want to enjoy their time. Not from worrying if their WiFi is bad. So this is my opinion. I am only 11 years old and I still have my judgments.	positive

Maybe it is just me and my friends, but it is usually a little bit lag he. Overall I will write this app five stars. ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è	positive

Also when it says someone is around they actually aren‚Äôt on their device at all so when ur calling someone and then u say u gotta go somewhere they think u don‚Äôt wanna talk to them which seems really unfair. Also delete messages 

But why it‚Äôs good coz it‚Äôs rlly safe and it‚Äôs fun to use and plus there isn‚Äôt any bills for calls. If ur parents don‚Äôt let u show them this review: PARENTS PAY ATTENTION: 
This app is sooo safe coz u have to accept requests of friends and Houseparty is also good if u wanna have study sessions of something together but u can‚Äôt actually meet up or if u have lessons with a tutor but he/she can‚Äôt come u can do it over house party so yeah HOUSEPARTY IS AWESOME"	positive

One issue I have is that if someone wants to join in to video chat with you, the app doesn‚Äôt ask permission if your screen is open. It automatically just begins a video chat session and that could be awkward at times. I was in the middle of brushing my teeth and the screen just popped on bc I‚Äôd opened it to see who was online. I really feel like there should be a delay where permission is asked and either granted or denied. It shouldn‚Äôt just open up into a chat like that. It‚Äôs a bit weird. Other than that and occasional connection issues (could cry well just be my internet), I‚Äôve had no problem at all with Houseparty. It‚Äôs an amazing way to have fun with friends when physical connection isn‚Äôt possible.	positive
766	1065781769	social	4	I love this app so much but there‚Äôs just one main flaw for me. The thing I don‚Äôt like about this app is that when your using the app any of your friends can instantly connect to you there‚Äôs no answer or decline button. This problem only happens when I‚Äôm on the app other times when playing another game and someone calls me I can choose to answer. I‚Äôve had situations where a friend would call me and my parents would be on a work call and I didn‚Äôt have my headphones in. My dad would have to come and ask me to keep it down. So I had to go up in my room, and sometimes I didn‚Äôt even want to be on the phone, but I didn‚Äôt want to be rude. There was also this time where, I was checking my friend requests while getting dressed and a friend called me. I had no pants on so I had to ask to call her back. Other than that I love this app! Please fix this problem with a new update.	positive

For example my Houseparty and my friends Houseparty on the MacBook is really bad, for one of my friends so bad that she can‚Äôt even open it. Another thing it‚Äôs not even an app that you can download on the App Store it‚Äôs a link that you can send to your email, but the thing is what happens if you don‚Äôt have an email, you have to think about these things because some people in Houseparty are little and they just want to talk to their friends. Also there is no way to log out on your Mac to switch to other accounts and on top of that you can‚Äôt invite anyone to rooms, receive messages, and send messages. These are all the things I ask to make it better. 

Ps: my friend also sent a review for filters and you said they were gonna come out soon but I still see no sight of that."	positive
768	1065781769	social	3	While this is a great app, there are some issues that have yet to be fixed. first of all, it constantly kicks people out of the app. that can get annoying when you are trying to have a conversation with someone and it does this several times throughout. Another being that the audio is sometimes awful to the point where you cannot hear what the person is saying. It cuts out at random points throughout and it gets hard to understand. It also takes a long time to load. I am currently trying to use the app and it refuses to load. It has nothing to do with my connection as this happens no matter where I am or what wifi I am using. The app gets updated a lot but it doesn't seem to actually be fixing anything. I would love to give this app a five star review but because there‚Äôs so many bugs I can‚Äôt. I make sure to always update the app when updates are available, but nothing seems to change or improve.	positive
769	1065781769	social	4	Hi! I like this app very much. It helps my friends and I communicate. One of my friends have Samsung and I have an iPad so I could never talk to but her but now I can! I just have a few questions. How do you sneak into the app? I have a few friends on this app, that anytime I go on the app they join me. Not that I don‚Äôt love my friends or anything, it can just get annoying sometimes. I have looked in house rules and it tells me to pull down the notification but what notification?! Also how do you make a face mail? When I try to it says turn device around to record. So I do that and nothing happens and sometimes it is very important. One time I couldn‚Äôt reach one of my friends because she wasn‚Äôt on her phone. It would be helpful if you put how to make a face mail in the House rules. Otherwise then those two questions I love the app and would definitely recommend it!üëçüíú	positive
770	1065781769	social	5	"Thanks sooo much for this app!  I‚Äôve been able to use this with my 3 sisters, and also with friends in place of our regular dinner outing.   I had never tried it with more than 4 until today.  One of my best friend‚Äôs has been COVID-19 positive for over a month now and has been in ICU for a month, and was on ventilator 11 or more days.  The app did great with seven of us in 4 states being able to see our friend or relative in the ICU, and he us.

The hospital chaplain had to get phone from parking lot, walk it in & up elevator to ICU.  Nurse put on PPE, and took phone into ICU. A few ‚Äúfreezes‚Äù due to connection strength, but it never cut out.

My friend cannot talk again yet, but could move his eyes & arms in response to us talking & waving.  We could all tell this meant so very much to him & lifted his spirits, so again, thank you so very very much !!!"	positive

I also love the feature where you have mutual  friends because people that I have not seen for at least 2 years have Houseparty and I can call them. I use this app every single day with my friends and even my family. I also love the new logo it‚Äôs more stylish and fun then just a cup. I am so happy that Houseparty is an app and I hope all of you working at Houseparty HQ are working on making it better. Oh and I forgot to say something about face mail, ITS THE SMARTEST THING EVER! Whoever designed that should get a reward.

Thank You for reading my review and I hope to hear back from you guys at Houseparty!

772	1065781769	social	3	This app is so great. My friends, family, and coworkers have loved using this as opposed to FaceTime or zoom because of the games. The games with your loved ones on this really helps to temporarily forget the stressful times we have living in. However, there are some really annoying aspects of this app. 1) Way. Too. Many. Notifications. The notifications settings in the app are very limited. I get a notification every time a new Facebook friend joins the app. It‚Äôs extremely annoying. I‚Äôm probably going into my iPhone settings and completely disable notifications for the app entirely until the fix it. 2) the app isn‚Äôt intuitive and user friendly. Even for me who is super techie, it‚Äôs a trial and error of pushing buttons to navigate around. My older relatives would definitely not be able to figure this out alone. The user experience should be improved a bit.	positive
773	1065781769	social	4	I absolutely love this app! I was psyched when my friend showed it to me! I like that you can wave to people and alert them that you are in the app and that the app tells you when someone you don‚Äôt know is in a room. I also think it‚Äôs a nice touch that you can lock rooms, but I hate hurting my friends feeling if I want a private chat with a couple of other people with out them. I hope that in the future their can be more privacy settings. But over all this is he best video chatting app I have ever tried. But I‚Äôm tired of whenever I go to the app someone can join. I clicked the app on accident and my friend (a boy) logged on when I had only a towel on. I ended the video chat before he could even connect but that was very scary! So I hope it can be changed for the future, but anyway a great app and I hope it gets lots of praiseüòá	positive
774	1065781769	social	2	This app has been great, it‚Äôs as advertised. It allows you to chat with many different people, doesn‚Äôt crash and is hardly glitchy. My concern is after having this app for a month or so, I am beginning to question the privacy given on this app. If you continuously tap the facts, it shows new ones every time but there are however some very inappropriate almost ‚Äúfacts‚Äù such as- ‚ÄúYou look hot‚Äù, and many other gender assuming ‚Äúfacts‚Äù and is leading me to question if there are people behind this app watching you and putting in obvious information in specific people. Such as if the user is a male, they give you facts specifically for males or if you are a female, it gives you facts specifically for females. I have been given many inappropriate facts and just facts in general that aren‚Äôt appropriate for children even though this app is advertised for 9+. Definitely gonna be looking into this because it puts in a very unsafe and uncomfortable position.	positive
775	1065781769	social	1	"Doesn‚Äôt work anymore on iOS 13. Always drained your battery too much anyways. On to the next app!

While I think this app is loads better than FaceTime (doesn‚Äôt hang up when you turn off your screen, takes up all your screen with no wasted black space,) it keeps messing up the orientation of video chats as my friends will be upside down or sideways when chatting. It requires closing the app and reopening it. Also, I wish there weren‚Äôt so many gestures, as everyone always accidentally swipes out of a room. It‚Äôs a feature none of us use (why would we be going in and out of chats like that?) And if you guys could tone it down with the amount of notifications this app produces, that would be great. Other than that this app is still way better than FaceTime, which has become gimmicky junk over the years. All we want to do is video chat to talk, no stupid overlays or memojis that only drain the iPhone even more and add no functional value to the experience."	positive
776	1065781769	social	4	I love this app! It is so great to be able to talk to all of my friends at one time but it needs improvement. It glitches all the time and the sound is always cutting in and out. There was time when me and my friend were having a serious conversation and because the sound cut in and out I missed important parts of the conversation. I also think there could be improvements on the whole ‚Äúpassing notes‚Äù agenda! One of my friends doesn‚Äôt have a working phone and so Houseparty is the only way we stay in touch. Sometimes we can‚Äôt video chat and we want to text but sometimes we don‚Äôt receive the notes or it freezes before we can pass them, so I also think there should be improvements there. This app is great but it could be even better if it had these improvementsüòä!!	positive
777	1065781769	social	5	I downloaded this app a few days ago and I absolutely love it. Especially now with the quarantine it makes it easier to be able to chat with everyone. A lot of people I know don‚Äôt have iPhones so we can‚Äôt FaceTime. This app solves that problem. The other problem with FaceTime is you can only talk to one person at once. I LOVE that you can talk to multiple people at once. I had a group of 6 the other day and it was great to almost feel like we were all together again. The ONLY thing I wish was different was that there were more games. There are a few now but I hope there would be a few more and better variety in the future. There‚Äôs also a LOT of repeat questions on trivia and drawing guesses etc.	positive
778	1065781769	social	4	"I absolutely love Houseparty. The only change I wish was real was to make it less glitchy. The glitching just drives me CRAZY!

Otherwise, this app is by far one of the BEST apps I‚Äôve tried out. In my opinion, it is a lot better than FaceTime. The coolest features are the games, and that u can have friends u could talk to on a daily bases. The games r such an awesome idea if u don‚Äôt just wanna talk, but you wanna play, too! And when I play trivia, I start to learn new things!!! Like how drakes real name is Aubrey! That was an unexpected fact.

I looked at my phone and saw that I was on Houseparty with my friend. Please make it that if your friend wants to talk to you, you have to click like an answer button or something. I could have been doing something else when this happened!!

#2. I was reading a review and it said that Houseparty helped the reviewer and his/her loved one be together for the loved ones last breath. Now this is the review that got it up to 3 stars! But then when I read the developers response, I was shocked! He/She said ‚ÄúThis review was very heartwarming. How can we get it up to 5 stars!!!!! I mean I know you wan your app to have 5 star reviews from everyone but that‚Äôs not gonna happen my friend!!!! This knocked it down to 1 star........ unbelievable......"	positive
780	1065781769	social	3	"Big fan of the app as I am able to reconnect with friends and family I haven‚Äôt spoken to in a long time. All the games are also a big plus. 

Issue: There should be a choice to be able to either be accepted or denied in joining a chat, rather than automatically being put into one when someone randomly decides they want to join you. 
I have friends that had joined into a chat no one knew them in except for me and it just made things uncomfortable, especially when it happened mid game. People could also be in the middle of a personal conversation and a random friend or family member could just join in and make things weird. If possible, maybe a choice to be able to kick someone out of the group chat would be helpful. Or maybe being able to ghost yourself while on the app."	positive
781	1065781769	social	5	Recently, summer break came and I transferred to a new school. Because of Houseparty, I‚Äôm able to connect with my friends while I‚Äôm away! The games always make us laugh and I feel we are connecting even more! One time, my friend, (fake name: Pablo) was spamming my call button. I kept hanging up and after like a million attempts, Pablo stopped and I answered and he started yelling at me. My other friends got the in the house notifications and joined. Then we all started arguing and joking at the same time. Chips and Guac was our favorite. For the dead emoji I put a dead meme or old celebrity and the judge started laughing. Keep up the epic updates and soon, houseparty will grow to be an extremely famous app. Thanks for the best app ever!	positive
782	1065781769	social	5	I think houseparty is a really good app for phones that don‚Äôt have FaceTime or google duo. I just think there needs to be a few adjustments. Like I wish the connection for this was better. And most of the time it isn‚Äôt really working for me. The persons screen I am talking to doesn‚Äôt match up the words to there screen. Overall the app is a really good app and I do recommend it to other people like friends and family. I don‚Äôt like the fact that you can ghost people and they don‚Äôt even know it. I think you should get a little notification saying ( example of random people) Suzy ghosted you because she doesn‚Äôt want to talk to you right now. But, overall those are my only complaints. I really like this app. üòâüòâüòâ	positive
783	1065781769	social	5	When I use this app, I have a tendency to sit at the room next to our living room. Only with this app I do this. Today I was talking to my friends and was showing them the view and We witnessed a car accident. The car that got hit received a huge blow($2000 worth) It took me a minute to realize, that car that just got hit, was my dad‚Äôs. Thanks to this app I witnessed a car accident and was able to settle things with the person who caused the accident quickly as opposed to my dad seeing his car jacked up the next morning and going through the trouble of finding the person and calling the police and whatnot. And for this, I would like to thank the creators of houseparty for saving my dad hours from his life. Bless this app.	positive
784	1065781769	social	5	I‚Äôve never written an app review before, but after using this for the first time last night with friends in the midst of our covid-19 social distancing/quarantine, we all had such a great time with it that I decided to write a review to show full support. It‚Äôs a wonderful way to socialize and play games with people despite being far away from each other. We turned the games we played into drinking games, and it felt like we were all partying together, only it was all done virtually lol. The games do need a little update as far as more categories/cards/options, otherwise they can get repetitive, but I hope the developers are working on introducing that soon. Thank you for the amazing app!	positive
785	1065781769	social	4	I love HouseParty it‚Äôs really easy for me to talk to my friends especially because I can know if there available or not just by seeing if there in the house. I love it, FaceTime has given me issues in the past year because of Group FaceTime. It wouldn‚Äôt let me and my friends be on it. But then we found HouseParty and we absolutely loved it. There is a little bug though. Every time we try to get in a call or something it kicks one of us out, and it stops HouseParty. But maybe that‚Äôs just us? Well other than that HouseParty is super amazing and if you fix the bug I‚Äôll be happy from night and day. But anyways I‚Äôve had HouseParty for over a a year and I definitely recommend this app because it‚Äôs definitely suitable for all ages who‚Äôs re aloud to talk to the friends on any electronic!	positive
786	1065781769	social	3	I love houseparty and everything about it but I just had a severe glitch and tried everything to fix it. I was talking with my friend and all of a sudden it says we are not in the same room but we were. So we tried leaving and joining again. But then it said try joining again because there was a problem, this happened many times and got very annoying. I was so frustrated and so was my friend. I even tried turning off my phone and turning it back on and it still didn‚Äôt work. I tried getting off my WiFi and going on cellular data and it still didn‚Äôt work. So we just stoped trying and we are gonna try again later. My houseparty is fully up to date so that is not the problem. I don‚Äôt know what is. Please fix it because it makes me want to delete the app and just Group FaceTime.	neutral
787	1065781769	social	5	"I have had this app for quite a while and I find it very useful to me and my friends. I have lots of friends and things don‚Äôt work out if I can only call one of them at a time! Houseparty helps a ton for me! My friends have friends that they invite and it gets a little crowded. 

   The only things about this app is that there is a limit of 8 people. Sometimes it is a little frustrating when you can only have 8 people in the house. 

Lastly, I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who is looking for an app to call all of their friends at once! Personally I would rate this a 4/5! But it still is a really amazing app even though it has a limit of people."	positive
788	1065781769	social	1	"I downloaded this app to chat with all my other friends, but as soon as I downloaded it it started having problems. I was trying to make an account and every time I inputted something it said ""error"". I asked my friends if this happened to them and they said it had to do with the Wi-Fi, so I connected to Wi-Fi and it finally let me make an account. Now 30 minutes later I have an account. Then I texted all my friends to get on house party chat and when I try to friend them it gives me another error message. Now I'm really frustrated with it but I decide to give the app another chance. So I connect to another Wi-Fi network and it still is giving me this error message! Honestly I don't know if it's my phone or the app but I am really upset with the service of this app. I hope I can get an explanation, this can be fixed, or both, but so far I had really high hopes for this app but it turned out horrible."	positive
789	1065781769	social	5	So I use house party a lot and people join and blast music so me and my friends can‚Äôt talk so could we get a kick eying to where someone nominates a kick and everyone in the call can vote on kicking that person and it could be anonymous but it tells the person that was kicked that they were too loud and they can still join back it would just be a warning system just so people can talk if they want and if they are kicked twice then they can wait or interact with other people in the meantime. I personally think it would be good just within how you guys would like to make it because people could spam kick but there could be a countdown timer and stuff like that.	positive
790	1065781769	social	2	"I should be able to open the app without my camera on. To get to controls even to learn I am immediately available and on screen. I should be able to enable my camera and be available after I open and choose right from the beginning.

I see there is a sneak mode. I find that to be very dangerous. To allow someone to be a voyeur of others without the knowledge is both dangerous and sketchy.

To be able to learn anything about the app and its settings etc , I had to open it early in the morning to ensure no one would just in with me. Also the camera is on when I open. Its a horrible operating system.

I have friends on this but find myself constantly avoiding opening because almost every time I have been caught off guard.

It would be great if the app opened without the camera, allowed you to enable it and choose to let people know you are on. When you join, it should walk you through how it works and the available settings (including the camera/available option), so that a new user understands how to set privacy and can do so without being bombarded by people unexpectedly.

This app is a great idea especially in these times, but it really needs some changes to ensure privacy and accessibility of features."	positive
791	1065781769	social	5	"I would like to thank the app‚Äôs team and developers. This app is a life saver. I am currently studying in the US as an international student for almost a year now, and I have not returned home in 6 months. I have only felt homesick a couple of time in these 6 months because of this app. I talk with my family and friends almost daily. The quality of the video is just amazing. It surpasses many video call services. Without this app I would have felt sad and almost depressed. Keep up the amazing work. 

PS: your device will become a little hot when you use this app for a long period of time. I think this is because the app is compressing and decompressing the videos to give good quality."	positive
792	1065781769	social	5	All of my friends have it so it‚Äôs great for making plans quickly. Texting is so hard because some people don‚Äôt look at their phones a lot so when you ring them they get a call so that‚Äôs better. And texting isn‚Äôt as clear as Housepartying because things get whacked up when you text. Also great for group projects for school because sometimes the teachers are mean and give us like a week to do a project and no one can get together so we can talk on the phone with EVERYBODY instead of face time wick is only two people and you can‚Äôt FaceTime someone who doesn‚Äôt have a iPhone so Houseparty is great. It‚Äôs an all in one app that‚Äôs really fun and it‚Äôs wayyyy better then Skype.üòã	positive
793	1065781769	social	3	This is a great app to keep in touch with friends and see each other and play games especially now with social distancing. But there just isn‚Äôt a lot of variety of games to play on here and the trivia game doesn‚Äôt give you enough time to read before you answer. When you are having fun, laughing and talking trying to read too takes time, before you know it time is up. Wish there was a way to add an adult version of chips and quac like cards against humanity. Other than that this is a great way to keep in touch with everyone. But if your playing in the same house make sure you sit away from the other person or they mute and turn down their volume or you‚Äôll get a horrible hamster wheel sound going on the whole time.	positive
794	1065781769	social	4	"Because of the pandemic, I haven‚Äôt been able to see my family or have family game nights like we used to. We played for over four hours on this app and it was hilarious and just so much fun. 
I just wish that there were more games to play or more variety to the games. If you need some help, I now have plenty of time to help with this stay at home order. More trivia, more chips and guac cards, more headbandz, more draw this! 
Overall this is a wonderful app to have during this pandemic and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to have my regular family game nights without it. Thank you so much for making this app, and I would really like to help expand it in any way I can to keep people entertained during the COVID-19 panic!!"	positive
795	1065781769	social	5	"Why I think house party needs more updates or changes 

So houseparty is a fund and cool app you may contact family and friends but the only thing that disturbers me is that you cannot send pictures or videos facemails could come in handy but I would like to say house party is the best free app as I said u
You may contact friends and family for example if you are a child have no phone but iPad you may contact you mom or dad by saying in the type in chat or type in private chat you may have more then 1 account logged in witch is cool!!

Houseparty is also a cool app because you can play games with friends and family you can call even though the person is on the other side of the world you may communicate with family as I said before but houseparty has a lot of lag outs so the person suddenly leaves the call and they say they didn‚Äôt and neither did you so that me the cal lagged out and it makes it hard to play with friends if they keep on leaving and I hope one day they fix it up.

We need more face to face communication! But that is not possible with groups of 3 or more people! Let‚Äôs face it! An app like this should have been invented a long time ago! Houseparty is an amazing app to help you chat it up (and even play a few games of Heads up) with friends!

Thank you for making video calls/texting epic. You truly connect people. I have some new suggestions/statements. Yes, I have edited this review many times but I just love Houseparty!

1. Make the ‚Äúfacemail‚Äù camera better. It‚Äôs only on HP that my camera is bad. 
2. Make a dark mode
3. Make it where you can send pictures when texting other people.
4. Stay awesome.
5. Thank you for making trivia free!!! It is so so awesome to not have to pay for it!
6. Please add more games. While your games are fun, it would be EPIC to have some more games to play.
7. Make it were best friends last forever. Once a best friend always a best friend. Make a recommended section where it‚Äôs easier to call those best friends.
8. Thank you for connecting everyone and strengthening friendships!!

I literally use this app every single day whether that means calling my best friends during the season of COVID-19 or playing trivia by myself because I am bored (üòÇ). Thank you for listening to your users! Peace out, HP! Hopefully this review was helpful!

Yours Truly,

Our family decided to stay a couple nights in a charming cabin just outside of Chattanooga, Tennessee. We booked through the app and it seemed really easy to make all the arrangements. The owner of the property was quick to respond via email about some questions my husband had and send the information we needed to unlock the door to get in! I would say it‚Äôs pretty cool that you can make these kind of reservations through an app on your phone! So neat! We get to our cabin, park, get our two little kids out of the car and head inside our cabin! Get inside and find that the place hadn‚Äôt been cleaned from the last guests who had stayed there......We were in awhhh....So we tried to reach out to the property owner ASAP and let her know that the place was not ready for new guests! We waited a short time and still no reply. So we decided to contact Vrbo instead. They were very nice about it. They reached out to the property owner who then contacted us shortly after. Long story short, the property owner refunded our two night stay. We still had to pay taxes on that and was charged a cleaning deposit still of $100. Anyways. Vrbo doesn‚Äôt take financial responsibility for refunds etc. Its not their fault at all this happened. Anyways."	positive
801	1245772818	travel	2	The app is okay at finding rentals. However, my first experience with VRBO was so terrible that it will certainly be my last unless they improve their customer service support and fix their cancellation policies to protect renters who get ignored by the rental owner/manager. We unfortunately got a rental that was manage by someone who did not respond for days. I VRBO directly first through the website online chat support, which seemed to be positive, but then I was told to call the corporate customer service hotline number to speak with an agent to ‚Äúescalate‚Äù my grievance about the lack of communication from the rental owner/manager. Because of the lack of contact from the manager and a negative review on the property I was confused about how to proceed and whether or not this rental was legit or a scam. I requested to cancel, and the manager finally responded by cancelling the rental and keeping the $1,700+ for 4 nights. So now we are out $1,700+ and have no rental! The agent from VRBO kept referencing policies and sounded cold and unable to make any changes or even partial refunds. At times, the agent could barely be understood. The customer service was abysmal at best. Apparently, VRBO does not do a good job at quality control and keeping property owners/managers in check to ensure customer satisfaction and good communication.	negative
802	1245772818	travel	5	"I love VRBO, I‚Äôm such uncertain times like the world is going through right now with the Coronavirus so many things are unclear and not reliable so it is a great comfort that VRBO is what it has always been. A sure thing, a safe, easy, secure website allowing so many displaced people to find shelter a home or room to be safe and warm. Where u can cook your own meals, warm up by a fire. Bring your loved ones together to be with each other as well as provide income to family and home owners that is so needed right now due to the current job market. Everywhere people are getting laid off and businesses are closing but I can say with confidence that VRBO is up and running and provide safe 24 customer care and knowledgeable People who are there to help everyone and go the extra mile to help with bookings and cancellations in case u are not able to make your trip to your vacation rental. In my case I‚Äôm not able to go home or travel because the state I‚Äôm in is on lockdown and VRBO and home owner carylon in Eugene Oregon are the best and have my sincere appreciation and warmest regards

The place smelled, there were burnt-out lights, the blinds in one bedroom fell the middle of the night and everything was worn out, i.e. the bedding, kitchen cabinets.
For our trip in January 2020 we made a reservation for a condo at the Jockey Club. On December 9th we received a message that our reservation had been cancelled and a refund was being sent. It is very hard to get a decently priced room during the week of CES, which is why we always book early. My husband contacted VRBO. They said the owner is not allowed to do that. They tried to reserve another condo for us and said they would pay the difference. They also told my husband that if the owner didn‚Äôt respond within 24 hours they would call him to help book another place. They didn‚Äôt. 
We will never book a place to stay through them again and are telling everyone we know.
BTW, a friend of mine who goes to Hawaii every year has had several people tell her about the nightmare experience they‚Äôve had with VRBO. At least two of those said when they arrive at their destination, found out that the place they had paid for was rented out to someone else."	positive
804	1245772818	travel	1	I recently booked travel through the APP to stay at a cabin in Asheville,NC. The process was very easy for them to book my stay and the money was sent immediately upon reserving the cabin. I also purchased their ‚Äúcancellation insurance policy for 45$. When we realized we could no longer go on our trip I called VRBO to cancel. They told me they can not cancel my booking and the insurance policy was through a company called CSA. CSA travel insurance claims have to be filed online and you will be waiting weeks to hear back from them. The process to file a claim is the worst I have experienced. The other option was to call the booking agency for the cabin itself. I called them and they would only refund 50% of my money even though I was cancelling months in advance. They said they had nothing to do with VRBO or CSA travel insurance. VRBO is racketeering with CSA travel to have you pay travel insurance then making the process ridiculously hard in order to receive a refund to make you not want to cancel through them and they still keep their profit. VRBO is fast to take your money but provides little help when you need to cancel. In the military I have travelled for 15 years using various apps and this is the worst one I have seen thus far. CLICK AWAY!	negative
805	1245772818	travel	3	"Not buggy at all, but functionality could be improved. The map feature is pretty limited - would be nice to be able to switch to satellite view, get directions, see what else is nearby, etc. The rate display is not great either - even though you enter in the date range when you search, you still have to select an entry and then select again to see what the total will be. And even though it shows the nightly rate when scrolling through the search results, just because one entry has a lower per night rate doesn‚Äôt mean the overall stay is cheaper, because taxes and fees are not factored in. So you could see one place for $200/night, and another for $215, but the total for the latter could end up being less overall. And lastly, when you share a property with someone, that person has to get the app to see it, instead of opening the website. 

P.S. While writing this review, I tried to select a word and ‚ÄúLook up‚Ä¶‚Äù, and then was locked out of the keyboard. I could select text but not type anymore. Not sure if that‚Äôs iOS or the app‚Ä¶"	positive
806	1245772818	travel	3	"This is a pretty good travel app overall.  I‚Äôm frustrated about a few things, however, and want to pass them on to the developers. (1) Add a button next to the heart (favorite) symbol to allow us to remove a property from a list if we‚Äôve already ruled it out. I would suggest an ‚ÄúX‚Äù. I can‚Äôt remember which properties I‚Äôve already considered, especially if I cant return to my search for several days.  (2) Add the dates for travelers reviews. I take recent reviews more seriously than reviews that are a year old, for example. I think the property managers would like this as well since it allows them to recover from a bad review.  (3) Break down ‚Äúwasher dryer‚Äù into two pieces - in unit and shared. I won‚Äôt stay someplace without a w/d in the unit and there is currently no way to find this out without contacting the property managers. (4) Break down the ‚Äúfree parking‚Äù filter into free onsite, on street, and valet. Again, it is nearly impossible to know the parking specifics without contacting the manager. 
Hope this helps. I love VRBO and have been an owner and traveler for 20 years."	positive
807	1245772818	travel	1	"If I could zero stars I would. 
I Booked a property through VRBO and had to cancel because it was not the right property for us. Before canceling I looked into VRBO‚Äôs return policy. I cancelled my booking 2 days before the full refund deadline passed. We are now on the 13th business day since I‚Äôve cancelled, and i have not received 1 penny from this company. We‚Äôve called numerous times and the responses we get are flat out ridiculous. All they tell us is ‚ÄúKeep checking your bank account‚Äù or ‚Äúyour refund is pending for some reason‚Äù nobody that I talk to can tell me why or put me on the phone with someone that can help me. To make matters worse I am taking my family on vacation in 2 weeks and I really need this money. We all know how expensive it gets when you travel with a family. This experience with this company has been a HUGE inconvenience, and has already RUINED our chance of doing things on vacation that we had been planning on doing for quite some time now. I am beyond disappointed in this company for treating its customers like this. I for one will be thinking twice before booking with VRBO in the future."	negative
808	1245772818	travel	1	"I wanted to vacation in palm spring for my birthday and my daughters 1st birthday in July. Planning ahead, I booked a home that had everything we wanted and needed to have a nice stay. The owner of the home pulled the property from the program and is no longer available. There were only a few homes that fit the criteria for what I was looking for, and they only suggested 3 homes that didn‚Äôt meet that criteria. The prices were higher, less beds, less space. Highly disappointed. I did some searching on my own and found a home that I really liked but was slightly out of price range and I discussed this with costumer service to see if they could help me find a home similar to the home that i was interested in or honor the price I previously paid since this experience was such an inconvenience and unprofessional.. they wouldn‚Äôt even transfer me to the re-booking team.. they wouldn‚Äôt even let me speak to a manager or assist me in searching for another home since ‚ÄúI can do that on my own‚Äù is what I was told... 
I wish I was making this up.. what an awful experience."	positive
809	1245772818	travel	1	"I have no idea what to rate the property itself, but if I could give the owner Christopher Button zero stars, I would. This is a strong buyer beware. We had a death in our family one week before our trip, when I contacted the owner to see if they would work with us in changing the dates, he told us we would have to cancel and reschedule, and that he did not know what the policy was in regard to a death. He told us we should contact VRBO. Both of those show deception. Each owner sets their own policies. VRBO has nothing to do with that, nor do they have any standing to persuade an owner to work with a renter. If we had cancelled we would have lost 100% of our money, and freed him to rent the property to someone else. At that point, we discovered that at the time we booked, 45 days out, his policy was for us to lose 50% for a cancellation. 

Shame on VRBO for representing owners like this. Shame on me for booking with this owner once, but to think I would cancel (allowing him to rebook the property), pay him 100%, and turn around and rebook with him is crazy!
BUYER BEWARE!"	negative
810	1245772818	travel	1	Bad company. I would give a 0 if I could.  Don‚Äôt use this app!! I had an issue with the owner of the place I rented. She was a scammer. I notified the company and they did NOTHING about it. They told me I had to contact the owner to resolve any issue. Why would I contact a scammer to resolve an issue? After talking with 3 different people telling me something different, someone pretended to contact the owner and said they will call me back. It‚Äôs been 3 months and they haven‚Äôt contact me back. During this process, the homeowner had the company take down her listing. She knew that I had an issue and she tried to run and they did nothing about it. They didn‚Äôt care. Also, when I called the first time, the guy hung up on my face. They do not check the people‚Äôs listing, so the pictures you see could not be what your renting; even the description could be different. The listing I had was completely different when I arrived. This company will not solve issues. Customer service is terrible. I wouldn‚Äôt use this app again.	positive
811	1245772818	travel	5	I like that I can create and save different trip ideas and properties to a ‚Äúboard‚Äù, which is like a folder that allows different places to be saved. I have boards titled ‚ÄúFall TN ideas‚Äù and ‚ÄúBeach getaway‚Äù to save properties that look good in different cities/states! I am also very glad to see that the dates that a review was written have been returned as a feature! It‚Äôs very helpful to read when a review was written so if they complain it was cold and rainy, you can see the time of year that they were there! Likewise, if a bunch of reviews complain about an uncomfortable mattress, you can see if that was 4 years ago or last week and decide if it‚Äôs worth the risk. I also like the owner descriptions of the properties because they are insightful as to what makes their property or area special.	positive
812	1245772818	travel	1	I booked a rental through VRBO for New Years Eve months in advance. It was cancelled by the owner through no fault of my own, and I found myself without a venue for my event only a month before the holiday after friends had already taken off work and made plans to be in attendance. I contacted VRBO support who said they would help find me a comparable place and honor the rate within 4-6 days. After 6 days of silence, I called back to check in and was told that the customer service rep had lied to me and (despite their ‚Äúbook with confidence‚Äù policies) there was nothing they could do. After spending a lengthy amount of time on the phone trying to get some help, they emailed me two property listings in the specific location I told them I was not interested in. I have been searching for a new property independently for weeks now with no luck and VRBO has not so much as followed up with me. As a first time user, this has been an appalling first time experience with the site and I highly recommend against renting with them.	positive
813	1245772818	travel	1	This was the worst trip to snowshoe ever. We are from Tennessee but are very avid skiers despite having to travel to ski. We booked two nights at top of the world. We arrived early enough to ski for a while before we got our room. After skiing for several hours we tried to check into our room. Check in time was 4 o‚Äôclock, our room wasn‚Äôt ready yet. We called the owner several times to get him to send the cleaning crew to get our room ready by 5:15.       I complained about this and he cancelled our reservation and made us leave. We paid for everything up front: car rental, lift tickets and room for 4 people and had to leave. Everything was booked and we were unable to get another room. I lost money and time, it was taken from me. My family, friends and I will never be back here to snow shoe again. My advice is to rent from someone who is affiliated with snow shoe, that way you can have any issues taken care of on the spot. Jim Walton, property owner. Lives in NC, not here.	positive
814	1245772818	travel	3	"This app appears identical to the HomeAway app other than it tends to run a lot slower. Sorry but I find that as confusing as vrbo's name.

Reviews are not contained in the app. Requires a web page executed via an email. 

As far a vrbo is concerned, I view them as a necessary evil and a major step down from when HomeAway ran the show. We've rented via HomeAway for well over a decade. Every year at least 2 European homes. With vrbo and now beginning to rent in the USA, our experience has taken a decided turn for the worst. The US apartments tend to be furnished in the cheapest manner possible, some major systems/appliances invariably don‚Äôt work, check-in times (USA only) are directional at best and there‚Äôs inevitably last minute changes communicated to us by owners we never see. 

The app is fine for Europe. Renting in the USA is caveat emptor but I can‚Äôt suggest any better web based agent. It‚Äôs the nature of the USA. I‚Äôve rented luxury apartments for over $4k/week and the places were a dirty mess with designer kitchens full of stuff that didn‚Äôt work. 

Leaving bad reviews can get in the way of future bookings. So I only leave good reviews or no reviews. Judging by the low number of reviews per property, I‚Äôd suggest either occupancy rates are far below what it takes to make money renting or there are many others that use my approach."	negative
815	1245772818	travel	1	I will never stay or recommend this apt to anyone.  I have never in my life of traveling experience such horrible customer service, poor response time, and lack of communication.  The apartment was not ready when we arrived. We had a wait outside of the house for 15 minutes until someone arrived to let us in. I reached out the to the property management office several times prior to my arrival and a day before we arrived to give them my arrival time and no one ever responded back to me. I had to call twice to finally get someone on the phone to let them know we were heading to the apartment. I asked for the head of the property management office to call me and see if they would accommodate us for all the hassle we experienced. No one ever called us. There was mold in the bathrooms, the downstairs bathroom leaked water out of the tub. The toilet upstairs lid was broken. The door to the apartment was so hard to open. We just had a horrible experience. Never ever will I stay or recommend this apt to anyone.	negative
816	1245772818	travel	2	We have stayed in another floating house at Whitman Hollow in the past and have really enjoyed our stay. I would have to say that we are leaving this time and cannot say the same. The house is advertised that it can sleep 14 people. There were 10 of us, and yes there was plenty of room for us to sleep but there was very few places for everyone to sit together. There is a small futon in the living room, 5-6 stools at the kitchen table (1 was too loose to sit on), 7 chairs on the deck. The grill was in very bad shape and did not work properly. All of the beds need to be replaced, they are very uncomfortable and make noises when you roll over. There is a TV that we were not able to get the cable to work on. There is no wi-fi, and very little cell phone service. It was raining and we were all stuck inside with no TV and no service. Overall, the house itself wasn‚Äôt that bad it is nicely decorated and has potential to be a very nice place!!	negative
817	1245772818	travel	1	"As I worked through the challenges presented by my credit card company's fraud department (canceling and then delaying purchases for rentals in multiple countries), VRBO sent a message to the owner of a property that I desired to rent stating that my transaction was denied due to insufficient funds. That was not the case, and if it wasn't for the grace and patience of the property owner, my family and I may have missed out on a vacation home we desired to rent. VRBO has made communications with the owner exceptionally difficult and with its less than truthful descriptions of actual events has made me question the veracity of their processes and marketing material. Can any message you receive from VRBO be trusted? 
It would be great if this business connected owners with potential renters in a smooth and reliable process...I wouldn't mind paying for that. But as it stands now, my last two rentals via VRBO have been nothing but hassle. Will consider using other connecting businesses with future vacation rentals!"	positive
818	1245772818	travel	1	Booked a condo in Beaver Creek over July 4th. After 1 month after reservation made, received an email from Vail Realty requesting yet another list of ‚Äúdon‚Äôts‚Äù over the July 4th week that I needed to acknowledge and sign for confirmation of lodging. My family has paid over $6000 for 3 days of lodging in Beaver Creek, not including food, drink, shopping, etc. I was told ONLY the ‚Äúassigned guests‚Äù could be in the condo, no partying, etc. Funny guess you can party the other 51 weeks/year. I signed in protest & received an email back from Vail Realty stating that I was the ‚Äúexact type of guest‚Äùthey look at renting to. What is that? I believe they have an issue discrimination. Most of guests in Vail Valley over the 4th of July are white, young, professional! Not ALL tear up the Valley! Maybe these rental companies should take some classes on how to deal with difficult guests and NOT blanket ALL the guests. So very disappointed. We have been coming to Vail for 30 + yrs. We will find housing from private sources from now on!  Judy B	negative

820	1245772818	travel	5	Well read this review for a sense of how it went.  The trip started poorly as the Airlines lost our luggage.  It was returned the next day to the wrong location but out rental agent got it and delivered it for us.  We had a condensation leak in AC and Richi sent someone in a hurry to check it. It resolved that day.  Now the thing is the place was beautiful.  Very clean and had all you would need. It has dishes and pots and pans as well as soap, laundry soap a supply of towels, linens, paper products and the place was very comfortable.  The view was incredible from the balcony and the sunsets were picturesque. The three pools and the grounds were extremely well maintained and the security guards were very friendly and accommodating.  We are going back next July and can‚Äôt wait.	positive
821	1245772818	travel	1	"I booked a cabin via Vrbo and had to pay more in an ""emergency deposit"" than the cost of the trip itself ($750). That may have been the choice of the owner, but there should have been some sort of cap on what an owner can dictate for an emergency deposit. I was told by Vrbo that the deposit would be automatically released back to me by February 2 (a Sunday). Naturally, it wasn't. Now it's been two days past the auto delivery day and still nothing. It's ridiculous. My credit card company hasn't been charging me interest on the money because it was marked as a refundable deposit, but now that it's overdue, they've hit me with the full two months worth of interest. Money I'll never see again. And for what? Vrbo doesn't have a way for me to get ahold of them directly and points me to asking the owner about it, but he marked it as full refund over a week ago. There are so many aspects of Vrbo that I just don't trust anymore."	positive
822	1245772818	travel	5	"For us everything was magnificent.  From how easy we rented the condo , the quick response of the owner to confirm, The complete and specific information we receive.
the conditions of the condo, the fascities and cleanliness are perfect. 
The bed is very comfortable, everything works properly and in case of any question the  owner Mona answers quickly.
The condo is on the second floor, very close to the elevator. On the first floor is the ice machine and the attention in the from desck is very nice and professional. Access to the pool and hot top is a short walk from the main lobby.
The HarborWalk is beautiful, it invites you for a relaxing walk.  It offers activities for all preferences and ages.  On the boulevard there are restaurants, cafes, specialized in pizza and hamburgers, sea food ,ice cream .Anything you want ...everything be there
To do the shopping I recommend the relatively nearby Walmart.  On that side of the road you do not face the bad traffic of Destin.
The beach are amazing, the sugar san and quite and warm-water. You  can go in own car, golf car or hotel bus. 
Thanks Mona . We definitely will come back and will be recommended to all my friends and family."	positive

We were greeted by the owner, Gunther, who showed us a tour of his beautifully decorated house. I loved waking up every morning before my kids woke up and having a cup of coffee on the dock while listening to the loons and was treated by seeing a bald eagle. Lake is so clean and surprisingly warm. Kayaks, canoes, and a awesome fire pit were there to use, so convenient. You never wanted to leave, always something to do. However if you do want to leave for a day trip, Ogunquit, Portland and Kennebunkport is just an hour away. Great location. So blessed to find this place. Thank you again Maggie and Gunther

824	1245772818	travel	1	"I recently booked with VRBO but my plans changed. I was WELL within my cancellation time by several months (9 months), so I went to the app and hit the ‚Äúcancel rental‚Äù button. 24 hours past so I attempted to contact the owner through the VRBO app. He didn‚Äôt reply so I called VRBO. They attempted to contact the owner and could not. Later that day the owner messaged me back and said he would authorize the cancellation through VRBO. Another two days passed and the rental is still in ‚ÄúCancellation Pending‚Äù status. So I messaged the owner once again asking if he had authorized the cancellation yet. No response. So, back to the phone with VRBO. They attempted once again to contact the owner and told me they would ‚Äúescalate the situation‚Äù which means nothing. I have now called American Express to see if they can dispute this charge. 
As of right now, some random stranger in the Caribbean has over $1500 of my money and apparently can keep it as long as he pleases. At this point I don‚Äôt even know if this rental exists. 
VRBO IS NOT THE MANAGER OF THESE RENTALS. THEY ARE SIMPLY A WEBSITE FOR LISTINGS AND CHARGE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS FOR THAT SERVICE. 
You are literally giving THOUSANDS of dollars to a complete stranger who can cancel your reservation at any time with no repercussions, and can keep your money even if you decide to cancel your trip. 
YOU HAVE NO PROTECTION FINANCIALLY!

VRBO is absolutely NO HELP in this."	negative
825	1245772818	travel	2	This was my fourth attempt to book a rental I hope it works this time.  The first time I got a notification the the hadn‚Äôt responded and my request had expired.  I tried resubmitted my request put my payment info get rejecting as invalid.  I called the reservation line and was able to reserve it again.  In the mean time I received an email from the owner confirming my first request.   But because the HomeAway request expired my down payment didn‚Äôt go through.  Even though the person I spoke to told me my down payment would be charged to my card that day.  I emailed owner to see what was happing and said my reservation was on the books but my payment request expired.  So he had to remove me from the reservation calendar so I could submit this forth request.   Your system needs some serious fixing to make this process more user friendly.	positive
826	1245772818	travel	2	When I began the search for a property, I put in the dates and the price range. Now, I expect whatever that comes up in my search to only have the property with those prices that will apply to the actual dates I stay. I don‚Äôt know how they do their calculations but when I tried to book, it gave me what I calculated as total + $4,000 telling me that it includes ‚Äútaxes and fees‚Äù. It did not break down how in the world that number was calculated. I don‚Äôt know where this website thinks we live in, but I certainly don‚Äôt understand how ‚Äútaxes and fees‚Äù could cost that much. It needs to be more specific and accurate to post the price-per-night when the user actually took time to put the dates we search and the price range so that no one wastes time on looking at all the properties they list for you that you cannot afford.	positive
827	1245772818	travel	3	It is helpful in finding places to stay but can be improved.  First, a search feature based on the amount of beds at the place would be helpful. Many properties shown provide a number of people that can stay there based on people sleeping two to a queen or king bed. That is not always the case.  I searched through several properties reading the descriptions to count beds to make sure there are enough beds for my group.  Second area of improvement is the credit card info.  The app is really picky about how the info is entered.  My card was declined several times before I entered in all the info in a way the app liked it.  Note I double checked my account to make sure it wasn‚Äôt a problem on my end, which it wasn‚Äôt.  The app can just be more user friendly.	positive
828	1245772818	travel	1	I booked a weekend house with Vrbo in July 2019 and through the course of making accommodations, we found that the gentleman misrepresented the number of guests his house would accommodate and would not allow us to stay with the number of guests we required. Because this information came to light within the cancelation period, Vrbo did not help us to get any of our money back despite reading our conversations and coming to the conclusion that it was indeed a misrepresentation by the property owner. They said the best they could do was to force him to correct his listing, but they could not make him reimburse us the $932 for the weekend rental, that it was between us, and he did not reimburse us at all, leaving us out $932. I would recommend making accommodations anywhere else with more certainty they are actually able to monitor false listings and to follow through with reimbursing renters who are misled.	positive

Very beautiful inside. Exceptionally clean. Everything was well stocked for our ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù. Easy check in and check out. We loved the layout of the bedrooms and the large master bath with a jacuzzi type tub. Plenty of storage space as well.  Very modern. We are planning to go back in the fall and we will certainly check to see if this is available first! There was a beautiful view of the ocean from the balcony, ‚Äúoff the beaten path‚Äù. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a larger condo at a great rate!	positive

Hands down I have discovered the BEST customer service and MONEY SAVING way to make my arrangements. Using VRBO I discovered SedonaJim Rentals and can not say enough praise about the way Jim and his staff take care of their customers. From saving me money to personalizing an itinerary for me based on ‚Äúwhat I might feel like doing and how to fit it all in AFFORDABLY‚Äù. I saved enough to take my daughter to Arizona on a hiking trip for the holidays that will provide treasured memories for decades! HUGE thanks to VRBO and SedonaJim Rentals for SAVING ME MONEY and making sure the customer feels like family. Incredible!	positive
831	1245772818	travel	5	"Donna has beautifully decorated this home.  Myself and 2 sisters stayed with our families.  Top end details make this home a must. 2 master suites (with jacuzzi tubs) plus another queen bedroom with a pocket door to a connected bathroom.  A bonus apartment with room for 6 kids to sleep, sectional couch, and full bath.  We loved this bonus apt because the door is up a few stairs from the main house and enclosed in privacy fence, private and felt the kids were secured.  
The garage had a grill and beach chairs for our use.  
The kitchen has granite counter tops with an open concept to the living space and tables or on the sectional couch to lounge or catch up with family and friends. 
The home came with a 4 passenger golf cart and we rented a 6 passenger golf cart which Donna ordered and had waiting for us. 
I can‚Äôt say enough about Donna, the homeowner, she answered my questions prior to arriving, any questions we had during the visit.  She wonderful and easy to work with.  
Plus, Fripp is awesome place to relax and enjoy some time away.  
We loved this home and Fripp.  
Thank you Donna!"	positive

Come back after our first night to all of our stuff from downstairs put on the top level.  Of course the money laying out got stolen though.  They had maids come by and clean the downstairs.  The reason being is that they double booked our place.  The downstairs has the washer and dryer there.  My buddy who rented the place has tried multiple times for a refund, but they won‚Äôt help.  Not even a little bit.  No matter any excuse, we were victims of false advertising at the very least.  On top of full price, they charged us a cleaning fee for moving our stuff out of the downstairs area.  It has been six months now and VRBO is basically ignoring our efforts.  I will never use this company again.  Hopefully, anybody else that wants to will read this and beware.	positive

Tried to book a villa at Hilton  Head in September which is basically off-season , in the middle of the week on One day notice. Property showed up as available and then the reservation was confirmed, after I selected it and paid with my CC on file, only to get Email the next morning from the property manager Stephanie saying we had no reservation because they will not accept them with less than 24 hours notice. They blamed HomeAway software for showing their property as available the next day when in fact it apparently was not.. somebody should fix this. Clay	negative
834	1245772818	travel	4	"The app is easy and quick to use - however it has one drawback, when I use the map to choose a certain area for available rentals, the list still shows rentals outside of the map area I‚Äôve chosen. For example, I chose the map area to include Pensacola beach and Gulf breeze, but the list still showed me many rentals in Orange Beach and Perdido Key,  which are nowhere near the areas I chose on the map, nor the areas I typed.

That‚Äôs the other issue, that when I type in an area, say Pensacola Beach, I got many many listings in other beaches such as Navarre, Orange, and Perdido key. This seems to be a glitch because I‚Äôve been using VRBO for 15 years and this is the first time I‚Äôve encountered these issues.

Please Fix!"	positive
835	1245772818	travel	1	We booked a trip through VRBO in Carmel from April 24th-28th for the Big Sur Marathon with another family. When Coronavirus became a national emergency, the race was cancelled and travel restrictions have been recommended by the government. I understand the VRBO policy to be 100% if within 60 days of travel, but I only see that I was refunded 50%. This is a huge loss for us because I paid in full when I booked it several months ago. We tried to contact VRBO by phone, and were on hold for 2 hours before we eventually gave up. I also tried to contact the property manager a few days ago, and have not yet heard back. I would hope that VRBO can do what AirBNB is doing for their customers (full refund for Coronavirus related cancellations). If not, we will probably not use VRBO in the future and we will share our negative experience with family and friends.	positive
836	1245772818	travel	1	I don‚Äôt typically post things like this but I think people should be aware.  These are scary and unprecedented times and no one knows what the next few weeks will look like.  Most companies are being flexible with people as a good company should.  Vrbo on the other hand is totally screwing up.  They state that they are ‚Äúencouraging owners to issue refunds‚Äù but are 100% standing by owners in their refusal to refund cancelled plans despite the country being in a state of emergency.  I don‚Äôt know what type of person you need to be to to use a time like this to make a profit but it is definitely not the type of person I would like to associate with.  Airlines, hotels, travel companies etc. are adapting and working with consumers.  Airbnb is offering full refunds to customers but Vrbo refuses to budge.  Shame on Vrbo and shame on the owners who are robbing people of their money without a second thought.	positive

We have taken trips all over the country from Charleston to Redondo Beach to the mountains of Pennsylvania and the National Parks of Utah and Arizona. Who do we trust to ensure we have a great place to call home base on our family adventures? VRBO, every single time. We have never been disappointed. No trips ever go completely as planned and for those unexpected issues, our hosts have always handled in a timely manner. I would highly recommend VRBO to my friends and family and will continue to use them to keep those great family memories going.

838	1245772818	travel	5	This app does a better job than Airbnb in helping you pick a location, with two features that are awesome - one is that it lets you actually draw an area on a map within which you want to stay - This is great especially if you know a city and want to draw a more specific area. Secondly, it pinpoint a location on map much more precisely than Airbnb so you can see with some confidence where the place is. Also, so far, there seems to be more availability on this app, which may be just a reflection of Airbnb‚Äôs marketing and presence, but having used both for the same cities, availability is much better on VRBO.	positive
839	1245772818	travel	4	On my phone app I don‚Äôt see a place to filter by minimum number of days that a Vrbo unit can be rented.  I am looking for a couple of places to stay for one night each on a trip this summer to a coastal city destination.  Makes it really difficult to sift through all the properties that show up in an area and only a very few will allow a one-night stay (I am not complaining that folks don‚Äôt want to rent for a single night).  I also noticed some properties are listed twice, one with a different rate and another that had indicated it would allow one night‚Äôs rental, but then when I went to book it, it required a 3-night minimum.	positive
840	1245772818	travel	1	"Not user friendly. Interested in a certain area and unless you you the map it shows properties in other towns. Waste of time. If I am interested in Longboat Key why do I get all other areas Cortez, Bradenton,Anna Maria and Siesta. If I search for Longboat Key, I should get Longboat Key Listings first then surrounding areas according to distance of area searched. 
I have been interested in several properties and when I search for them on the map they are NO WHERE NEAR the area I am interested in. Waste of time!!! Not at all user friendly. Other vacation rental sites are more accurate with searches in specific areas. I have traveled to the same complex each year so I know the area I want to stay in and when I search for that property I have to search scroll through 12-30 pages of properties that are no where to find the property."	negative

We especially loved the deck where we would end our days watching the Red Sox playing and winning the World Series! It was also a perfect location to walk to many of the excellent restaurants (The Floridian, Catch 27, Casa Maya, Michaels Tasting Room just to name a few) and also to take in many of the historic sights of St. Augustine without having to move our car.  We would definitely recommend this condo and hope to return soon. Mike & Marie	positive

We spoke many times and she was able to guide us through airport transportation etc. The location of the apartment is simply priceless. We didn‚Äôt want to rent a car and everything was directly at our door. The tube was so easy to maneuver. We didn‚Äôt spent much time in the apartment but it was exactly as advertised. We have two teenage boys so the pull out couch worked great. The bedrooms were large enough and two bathrooms really helped. Again, Gerry was excessively helpful and I‚Äôd highly recommend staying in her apartment. Great trip!	positive

Cynthia is a wonderful host who not only has a beautiful and well-appointed condo, but was so warm and easy to talk to, I felt as if we were old friends every time I spoke with or texted her.  She gave us great ideas on activities and places to eat, and hints about services the condo complex has to offer. The condo itself is lovely, extremely clean, and has absolutely everything we needed for a week of ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù!  If we ever make it back to Panama City Beach again, we will definitely arrange our vacay around the availability of Cynthia‚Äôs condo!	positive

What really bothers me is the cleaning fees used to be like $60 bucks.  Now, it seems pretty standard that they charge you $100 cleaning fee and then tell you to do all the cleaning before you leave to get your deposit back. VRBO also allows people to say things are included like tv and internet but then you arrive to find there is none of that actually provided. You can‚Äôt leave a bad review or else you won‚Äôt get your deposits back. It‚Äôs a mess over here in VRBO land. They are getting too messy and greedy. I started using the AirBnB app recently and have really been enjoying the lower fees. Only desperate times call for VRBO.	negative
845	1245772818	travel	1	It‚Äôs my first time to write an app review. But the experience is so disgusting!! I had booked a house in San Antonio, Texas and paid in full a couple weeks before My friends and I arrived in Texas. One day before Checking in, I sent a massage to the host to confirm my staying. The host replied to me at midnight and said I had to cancel it. I called the costumer service instantly , the staff confirmed my reservation and had no ideas on the cancellation. My group was 13 people and the house was canceled without any reason. When I ask for refunds, the staff said the money was in the account of host. In a word, as a traveler, you won‚Äôt get any protection. If you want to cancel one day before checking in, you have no chance to get the full refunds. If the host want to kick you out, they can do anytime as they want, without any punishment. I will NEVER use VRBO again.	negative
846	1245772818	travel	3	Please make sure that your vendors input  minimum-night limitations so that we do not waste time making a reservation and then having it canceled because we are not staying enough nights. It should be relatively easy for vendors to identify minimum-night limitations in their ads on your site.  Otherwise, making such a reservation, and then having the vendor call to talk you into staying another night or face a unilateral cancellation, is not only an unfair ‚Äúbait and switch‚Äù but also a breach of contract facilitated by your service as the vendor‚Äôs agent.  I trust that you will allocate resources to make such limitations easily available for vendors or else require vendors to abide by agreements struck through your service if they fail to do so.  Good luck!	positive
847	1245772818	travel	1	"I have been on a winter tour of the western states since Jan. 22, 2019 booking anywhere from 2-6 nite stays using this app. In total I have booked 13 nites at 4 different locations.  I have my dog with me. In every booking request I: 

1. queried for pet friendly properties and, 
2. upon entering details of my stay and i dicating a pet would be present was,
3.  quoted a flat rate plus various fees and provided a total for my stay. 

***** Note*****I indicated that I was bringing my dog in every instance. 

Yet, in every case when I checked in, I would learn from the owner that the quoted and confirmed price charged by VRBO/Homeaway didn't include a pet fee because the owner wasn‚Äôt aware a pet would be present? How is this even possible? 

This is problem with the app interface that results in a negative experience for the owner and the traveler.  In some instances additional- *hidden* pet fees were charged up to 50% of my whole stay. 

When I called to complain, the agent was rude, unhelpful and didn‚Äôt make any effort to understand my problem, or to help me resolve it. I guess they are ok with making the end-user feel cheated? 

Will never use this app again because they are bait and switching! First pets....then what?"	negative

Tried again now my dates aren‚Äôt available. Try few minutes later room is available again and I had $61 pending charge and $0 charge. Didn‚Äôt know if it went through or if I should find another place. Call and they tell me its available at a higher rate now. So I‚Äôm connected to booking and give all my info again I get confirmation from representative. Then I never received confirmation email or charged.

849	1245772818	travel	1	I‚Äôve been looking for an oceanfront unit to rent in the Longboat Key area, and I have encountered one snafu after another. One unit was displayed on the VRBO site that isn‚Äôt actually the unit. Another wouldn‚Äôt rent that far in advance, although the unit was listed as available on the dates I entered; even worse, the man who talked with me was quite possibly the rudest person I‚Äôve ever talked to.  Still another listed a tenant who had neglected to update his rates on VRBO, and the unit was actually four thousand dollars more than the listed price  ‚Äî Yes, you read that correctly.  I still haven‚Äôt found a unit, and it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm looking for something unusual. I‚Äôm just trying to find a unit that matches the VRBO ad. So if you use VRBO, know you‚Äôre going to spend a LOT of time wading through inaccuracies and omissions.	negative
850	1490384223	games	1	It was a good idea that you can choose a choice to save someone. I always see ads for games like this and I get the games and it‚Äôs totally different. This time it‚Äôs at least what the ad is. I don‚Äôt like how many ads there are. It‚Äôs soooooooooooooo bad how many ads there are. It‚Äôs sad that there is a good game ruined. I also think that some choices make NO sense, for example the level with the hole you have to cross has either a board of wood or a bucket. How am I supposed to know that the bucket has cement in it. Also, cement doesn‚Äôt dry in like 1 second she would have fell in. Another level that made absolutely NO sense was when she was hungry and she needed fish. There was a trident and a fishing pole. When I chose the fishing pole (which makes WAY more sense) it brought up a monster. How am I supposed to know that a monster comes up? That makes no sense!!! And the trident was right. I DON‚ÄôT KNOW ANYONE WHO FISHES WITH A TRIDENT AND I NEVER WILL BECAUSE THAT ISN'T AN ACTUAL THING. I am so confuseddddddddd! Am I just dumb or does this actually make no sense? I know I already said this but SO MANY ADS ITS FRUSTRATING. AN AD AFTER EVERY LEVEL AND AN AD WHEN U LOSE AND AN AD TO CLAIM GIFTS UGHHHH~~! I am deleting this and probably won‚Äôt play it again, But it‚Äôs a cool idea just remove the ads and make more sense pls! Thanks for reading!üôÉ	negative
851	1490384223	games	1	"I have played this game and it‚Äôs ok but what is now ok is these ads! Every time I beat a level it shows a ad. If you die it will show a ad like come on. I just want to play the game but sometimes it shows ads when I‚Äôm playing. One time I was playing it and I did the wrong choice and then a ad when I made the right choice it just kicked me out!!! I don‚Äôt really like this game but it‚Äôs ok if there were no adds I would really like that. If the person who made this game DON‚ÄôT PUT SO MUCH ADS!!!!!!!

And also this is just does not make sense at all. Why would a freakin bean turn in a Canon Why would a little Crain turn in a robot and punch a zombie why would a fishing pole catch a monster why would a pepper heat up the girl! That doesn‚Äôt work like that! It‚Äôs not heat it would be pain In your mouth your brain would be like it‚Äôs really hot but it‚Äôs just painüò°üëé. Why would a trash can cover a fire higgren that‚Äôs bursting water just leak out the trash can why would a rat scare the girl IF SHE CAN JUMP OVER THE HOLE. This is the most confusing game I played ever in my whole life."	negative
852	1490384223	games	2	I enjoy this game first of all. I‚Äôm glad the ad to the game doesn‚Äôt lie like some do. Although, and I‚Äôm sure people have said this before, the games choices sometimes don‚Äôt make any sense! Like how would you know that a fishing pole would pull up a monster!!!!! Me and my brother notice these things so much that we made up something where we literally just pick the thing that makes no sense and we win. Also after a lot of levels it didn‚Äôt show any more levels and just goes back to previous levels that you have already done but they don‚Äôt show the level number. That‚Äôs just rotten. Also there are soooooo many ads!!!!! Even if you don‚Äôt die you have to see a ad! Even if you don‚Äôt pick the thing that says get 200 coins if you watch a ad it makes you watch a ad so I don‚Äôt get why that‚Äôs even there! But I really do like this game and have a fun time playing it and am happy that the ads don‚Äôt lie about the game like other games do. I hope you see my review thank you.	positive
853	1490384223	games	1	There were WAY too many adds!!! There shouldn‚Äôt be adds after every level and when u loose and to get prizes and stuff. Also some levels were weird, like one level there was a hole with and option of a plank and a bucket, I thought the bucket was filled with water so thought that she would drown or something, so I chose the plank. She ended up getting scared of the spider and the plank broke cuz she fell, but the bucket ended up being filled with cement, like how am I supposed to know it‚Äôs cement, and cement takes a while to dry as well. I thought this game would be good because I see ads like this all the time and they‚Äôre never like what they say they are, so I got excited when I saw one that actually was what it said. I also don‚Äôt like how each level is only one question, like there should be a section, like when she was kidnapped, the level should be until she escapes the building, and then it moves on to the next level. I think these aspects ruin a good game, and if they were fixed I would download it again.	positive
854	1490384223	games	4	It‚Äôs going really well so far I like this game is cool and fun kind of teaching survival stuff  if ur in the situation but the problem is the ads the ads there not bad but it‚Äôs just one big problem the ads is like every time u get it wrong u have a add and I consider this as wasting ur time and one time with my coins I had lost the game and I had bought something for like 200 sense so I wouldn‚Äôt have to do a add but I still had to do a add so my suggestion is u should fix the add problem but it‚Äôs going great so far I love this game it‚Äôs really fun my family members or addicted to it but final my suggestion is fix the game and be carful while u make the game be sure to make sure every thing is ok and is going smothley so no problems and no hate reviews I know u can do better hope u have and awesome day	positive
855	1490384223	games	1	"This game is addicting but SOO annoying! 1. Adds! Too many. I‚Äôm sooo done with all of them!!! They are after and before levels! Watching adds all the time is the worst. 2. None of the right answers make sense. A rose to make a bear leave you? That makes absolutely NO sense! You don‚Äôt know what will work, or how it will happen, or show out. I hate that none of it makes sense, cause then you have to restart all over again and watch more adds. 3. It‚Äôs boring at a specific time. After one week of playing I have stopped. It gets boring. 4. It doesn‚Äôt lie. It‚Äôs not fake advertising. I promise. 
I don‚Äôt like this game cause it tricks you and makes you think sometimes, is this what you actually do in that type of situation? And it‚Äôs bad. Real bad. Now I want to say the good things. 1.

856	1490384223	games	1	I‚Äôve played this for a little bit now, and there‚Äôs only 66 levels. When you complete all of them, which I did in about half an hour, it just sends you back to about level 15, and you just do it all again until level 66, and it repeats. For a silent majority of the levels, the options that make 0 sense are the options you‚Äôre supposed to select. The ads are awful as well even for a free game, every level, one 15-30 second ad for about 15 seconds of gameplay per level. The animation and art style, no offense to the developers, but it‚Äôs downright ugly to look at, the way the main character walks and her facial expressions are just so visually unappealing I figured I would mention it in the review. It, like numerous other ad games I‚Äôve tried, are all crappy, poorly slapped together games and all of them mysteriously have 4.6 stars and some glaringly good reviews, this is a real review so do yourself a favor, and don‚Äôt bother installing.	neutral
857	1490384223	games	1	A lot of people have complained so I may as well too. This game has SOOOOO MANY ADS!!!!!! I mean as nice as it is to finally have the choice games to save someone‚Äôs life like in other ads, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to spam us with ads!!!! There are ads for FLIPPING EPISODE!!! Last I checked this game is 9+! Do you really want 9 year olds to watch an ad for episode and have them ask what the heck happened in it to their parents? I lit only downloaded this game for 5 minutes, saw all the ads, deleted it only to re-download to write this review! I wish their were not as many flipping ads as there are! Oh well... I suppose there is nothing I can do about it. If any creator is reading this, please for the love of the ocean get rid of how many ads there are! This is literally a giant commercial, with only 1 or 2 minutes to complete the level, only to watch ANOTHER AD AGAIN!!!!!!!! Please game devs fix this game! Get rid of how many ads there are! At least 90% of them!	positive
858	1490384223	games	5	First of all, don‚Äôt play this game online unless you want different outfits, sorry if that‚Äôs too much for you. Other than that this game is as funny as it looks, the scenarios are fun and even when you get it wrong it‚Äôs funny watching her fail. All you guys need to the do (the devs) is expand on her look and keep adding levels. Also you guys should make similar games with a different concept and reward people for never choosing the wrong answer (instead of a outfit) Overall you got the right idea just keep improving and upgrading. And yeah I know you make money from ads but NO ONE wants to watch 50 ads per gameplay you will lose your audience that way. Find other ways to import ads like archeroü§è okay bye.	positive
859	1490384223	games	1	All of the things that supposedly ‚Äúsave the girl‚Äù are the exact opposite of what you would think. For example, in one of the levels there is a giant hole and you have to find a way over it. Although neither of the answers would really work... I chose the balloon. The balloon popped as she was floating over the hole and the right answers was the rat. The rat comes up to her and she gets so scared she jumps. One time the girl was cold so I chose the fire and the wind blew it out. The right answer was the chili pepper that supposedly warmed her up even though that‚Äôs not how peppers work. I know it‚Äôs just a game and this may sound ridiculous... but it‚Äôs really sexist. The girl is really stupid and she prances around like an idiot with a tight dress and high heels. There are also way to many ads. When you due you can use your coins to survive, watch an ad to survive, or just die and start over again. No matter what you choose you still end up watching an ad.	negative
860	1490384223	games	1	"Let me be honest I don't even need to inform you on this HORRIBLE game, so many other people have prob informed you already. This game has a endless amount of ads. They come up every time you die and after every level. Speaking of that, this game is unreasonable. One of the levels are would you have a firework to get attention from a rescue team or a campfire.
I obviously chose the fire work...and it crashed into the rescue team. I had to watch another Mobil ad. Even after I finished the level I still had to watch a ad. But not after every SINGLE level it gives you an ad. It's still a lot though. A little girl could look up to this game and..end up in a similar situation, then die. The only positive thing I can think of is the game doesn't lie, you do have to choose between something to save your life. Yes I mentioned this at the end because this game is WORSE THAN WORSE. And if I could it rate this a 0 I would."	negative
861	1490384223	games	3	"There is two big things I don‚Äôt understand about ‚Äú Save the Girl ‚Äú 

#1 Say your trying to get through but there‚Äôs a green puddle, you click the mop and it says it‚Äôs sticky. There was absolutely no way you would of known that on your first try. Some people like me, thought the mop would clean it up like they do with puddles. It‚Äôs also unrealistic how the sun would clean it? Also when your on the island, someone might use the firework to shoot up in the air like a flare gun, you wouldn‚Äôt think it would come and hit the helicopter would you?

#2  Most games like ‚ÄúSave the Girl‚Äù connect each piece to each other. What I mean is like if your on a boat you wouldn‚Äôt magically appear in a forest, you would at least have to walk a little to get there like say I‚Äôm in a house and I walk to the beach or the forest!  You don‚Äôt just show up out of nowhere!!!"	positive
862	1490384223	games	4	I love this game! I got it yesterday and it‚Äôs really good so far. Some levels don‚Äôt make sense like when it was that goo on the floor and you had to choose between the mop and sun..the sun can‚Äôt magically rise like that and doesn‚Äôt seem realistic. The mop would make more sense but..ok. Now this is only one issue I have with this game. Ads, literally after EVERY. SINGLE. LEVEL I get an add. I think you should at least go 4 levels before getting an add. It‚Äôs just too many and I don‚Äôt like watching one every minute just to enjoy the game. Please can you fix it? It really bothers me and others too. If the issue isn‚Äôt fixed then I will have to delete the game. It just ruins it for me with an ad 24/7! But that‚Äôs all I wanted to say...Thank you for reading my review. Have a blessed day or night üòä	positive
863	1490384223	games	1	The game has no science and wayyyy to many ads and the genuine story an logic is trash. But it is super illogical to I mean come on how did the mummy get killed by a cat I mean all the cat did was meow and the mummy died of heatstroke or something I don‚Äôt know or when on the zombie level if you chose to turn around from the giant zombie than there would be more zombies behind you and you‚Äôd lose I mean that doesn‚Äôt make sense because just before that car thing took down a whole tree! And it also took down like 3 zombies so I‚Äôm pretty sure it could‚Äôve handled either some zombies or one mega zombie! And I honestly would like the game if it made more sense, didn‚Äôt have as many ads, and had more logical and reasonable  choices i mean come on how was I supposed to know that the cement was in the bucket and unless I‚Äôm an idiot I‚Äôm pretty sure cement doesn‚Äôt dry that quickly and how did the mole grow when it was wet?!?! ü§î	positive
864	1490384223	games	1	I hate to leave a bad review but I was extremely disappointed in this game. After every time you would die or complete the level a 30 second add would appear. Not only that but none of it made sense. You might chose one thing that actally makes sense but that is the wrong one. It really makes no sense at all. In my opinion this was a complete waste of time because most of the time I was watching the adds that the game requires to watch before you go to or redo the round. I am really disappointed because the ads made it seem really fun and that is why I downloaded it but the game was not what I was expecting at all. You might enjoy this game if you have nothing to do but I think it is a waste of time.I really hate to do this but I want to tell everyone about how the game is a time robber. I mean 30 seconds each add. It is really time consuming so therefore it was not my favorite game to play.	negative
865	1490384223	games	2	"I like this game but I payed to get rid of the ads but still have to watch an ad every third time just to get money to keep playing...I don‚Äôt mind watching ads but not as often as I have to after paying to get rid of them...could you please reduce some of the ads so I can keep playing longer than three frames...I will only give it three star‚Äôs until that glitch is fixed...if not then I will request a refund and delete the game

I had sent a review before and now I am changing my rating,  I am now giving it 2 stars. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.    I can not undo my my purchase which is to bad as now I am going to toss this up as a lesson learned.   Before I purchase to get rid of ads I will now wait until I make sure that I like the game enough to put up with something before I decide to either buy the game or pay for the ads to go away...
A VERY DISAPPOINTED GAMER..."	neutral
866	1490384223	games	4	I think this game was kinda fun just too many ads. I know a lot of games of lots of ads but I dong really like all the ads. So yes I would recommend this game if you are patient And you would be ok with the ads but if you don‚Äôt like ads I don‚Äôt recommend this game for you. When I‚Äôm about to go to the next level there‚Äôs mostly always an ad. I just want to play a game and an ad comes on like come on. Ok that‚Äôs done with the bad stuff. This game is very fun. It makes you use your brain a little bit. If you like using your brain I think this game is for you. So go get the game and have some fun!!!!!!! And don‚Äôt forget put your thinking cap on. Like literally put your thinking cap on because don‚Äôt make the wrong decision or at least don‚Äôt try to.	positive
867	1490384223	games	2	"When I saw this game I was super excited! Like ‚ÄúYes, this is finally the game in all the ads but is the REAL gameplay!‚Äù I was right about that, but....
There is no sense to it. Literally, the one object that would 100% work in a situation is the opposite of how it actually turns out! In one of the levels, your hungry, so you can either cook steak over a fire or call for take-out food. Call for take-out-good is the right answer!? Even though previously you‚Äôve tried to call and have no service. Like WHAT!? And to make it worse, the burger just comes flying down on a parachute. You are in the middle of a snowy wilderness, HELLO!? Few things actually make sense, and as the game progresses it really gets dumb. Ads are another problem, but I could deal with them, if this game actually had any mental common sense. Please fix it!"	negative
868	1490384223	games	5	"This game is the BEST game but it‚Äôs my opinion some people keep hating and it‚Äôs really starting to get on my nerves üò° I know there‚Äôs a lot of ads but it doesn‚Äôt mean I hate the game cause I have been reading the reviews and y‚Äôall keep hating üëéüèΩ!!!!!!! WHAT I HATE IS THAT YALL KEEP hating the developer did his or her best on this game and I THINK that I‚Äôm really the only good review and what‚Äôs sad is that I really only see 1,2,or 3 stars only one person did a 4 star but I haven‚Äôt looked through all of the reviews but you all need to stop HATING!!!!!!üò°  oh there is also a 5 star and I‚Äôm now a little happy.
There are only some 4 stars some 5

P.S I Really love this game üíï I‚Äôm already on level either on 38 or 37"	negative
869	1490384223	games	5	Okay But I understand why u have lower then 4 or 5 stars but this game doesn‚Äôt always have to make sense and I‚Äôm being honest some of y‚Äôall Think this is supposed to be a fun and use your mind type of game but some right answers on some levels may not make sense because this game is sometimes fiction and NON-Fiction type but u need to see this: did u even check the description? This is and was made because of all those games that advertised a playable ad of their game and some were true and some weren‚Äôt Real life answers I don‚Äôt know how to fix others Reviews/ point of view of this game but I‚Äôm saying a point	positive
870	1490384223	games	5	"The game is great it‚Äôs fun and it teaches you how to survive in different situations but there are some problems to this game 
1. Way to many ads whenever I‚Äôm done with a round or something there‚Äôs a ad and when I fail the round and I pay 200 coins it‚Äôs give me a ad once I paid so there isn‚Äôt a use in paying
2. The items sometimes don‚Äôt make sense like when I was playing it showed a gun and something else I chose the gun but then it wasn‚Äôt really real and also sometimes I don‚Äôt know what the item is or what it will be used for
Other than that the game is pretty good and u suggest it to people who don‚Äôt really know how to survive in the outside world"	positive
871	1490384223	games	1	Worst. Game. Ever. To. Be. Made. My first problem is when you get something wrong  you can just click the other one without any challenge. My second problem is too many adds!! I get your advertising other games but it‚Äôs too much! When you fail a level and there‚Äôs something that pops up that says: ‚Äú keep trying if you watch this add!‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the problem. The problem  is  that if you click no thanks you STILL HAVE TO WATCH AN ADD!!! I find this very annoying. Also, the choices make 0 Sense. The last level I came upon is the girl ran into a very dark room and the options were to give her a flashlight or a crowbar. Going back to the first reason that‚Äôs no challenge. And I‚Äôm a person that loves a little challenge. Ending results: I do not recommend you install this game. It is very poorly made. Thank you for reading and also these are MY opinions.	negative
872	1490384223	games	2	It‚Äôs an entertaining game. Finally a game like you see advertising all those games but actually isn‚Äôt part of those games. But GOOD GRIEF all the ads. You spend more time watching ads than you do playing the game. That‚Äôs why I give the low rating. I‚Äôm fine with ads on free games and expect them. How else are they free for us? But everytime you get it wrong, which is often, you watch an ad. Only 3 games per level which takes like less than 20 seconds, and you have to watch an ad to get to the next level. I‚Äôm bored to tears after a few minutes because all I‚Äôve done is sit there and watch ads. So I‚Äôll proybe deleting this one. There are more entertaining and less boring games to spend my time on. Cut the amount of ads and I‚Äôll play and raise my rating.	positive
873	1490384223	games	5	Since people are right that it does not lie , but if u are mad about the adds just turn on airplane mode . The reason they have so many adds for money , why else would anyone want to make a games (besides making people happy:) ) but still it doesn‚Äôt lie , there are a bunch of adds that shows how u have to save people but it‚Äôs really some thing different like the game ‚ÄúGarden Scapes‚Äù is really like candy crush but the adds is like save the guy so it‚Äôs really weird but at least there is finally a game like that :). But if I could give this 50 stars out of 5 ,I would  :) really recommend this game. It‚Äôs fun üíéüòá	positive
874	1490384223	games	3	"It‚Äôs fine, but it has a few problems. It might not bother other people but it does to me; when she slips on the water or something, she cries like a freaking BABY. It‚Äôs called man up, then get up and walk it off and go to the next level or whatever. It irritates me so bad. Another problem, there was this level; there was a big hole and it was either a balloon or a mouse? I was like ‚ÄúWho would choose a MOUSE?‚Äù
Some positives, there are some games that make you choose like this but it‚Äôs totally different! This one tells the exact truth. Also, the girl is hilarious. She is SUCH a girly-girl! The way she walks, jumps or pretty much does anything. But her face is... man-like. Sorry. Anyway, this is way too long than I meant to. I always talk too much, bye y‚Äôall."	positive
875	1490384223	games	3	It looks like a good app I myself like downloading apps.I played the game I found nothing wrong with it. Until I read the comments. I read two of them. Here are my opinions about this app. First of all things there are to many ads like take it down a notch! I know you get payed for 2 things 1 making the app in the first place 2 the ads. 2nd of all the explanation on why you got it wrong. Like in level 27 in the third quarter. When there‚Äôs a huge patch of water and you have the choice between a floaty or something else I forgot and the floaty was wrong. You know why?!! The mummies apparently was in the water. I know sounds stupid. Well I‚Äôm done here but I want to see the end of the app so I‚Äôm going to keep the app.	positive
876	1490384223	games	3	Ok so this game is fun because you can choose you ways out of situations. Although when you do it gives you a ad. The thing is when I got it wrong it said use 200 coins to survive or get a free to watch a ad. I didn‚Äôt choose any of them and it still gave me a ad. When it was the dog level how was anybody supposed to know a dog was go to chew up the chew toy. You would think that she would grow it but no. I think this game has WAY to many ads and that‚Äôs my opinion. If the person who made this game sees this hope you agree and make some changes not saying there has to be no ads there can be some here and there but not every level dude not every level it make changes thank you	positive
877	1490384223	games	2	When I saw this game I thought I would give it a try because it looked fun. I was VERY disappointed because 1. The girl herself looks like she had 30 plastic surgery‚Äôs and only one actually worked 2. This game HAS TOO MANY ADS I mean after every single level which is most of the time very short, I get a ad when I didn‚Äôt want one 3. This game is just out of the blue when it comes to the girl moving. At first she was kidnapped then she ended up in the middle of no where like there could be way more pacing. There is also no story which this game seems like it‚Äôs trying to create. This games concept is pretty good and simple but the way it‚Äôs executed is very poor maybe changing the way the girl looks or finding the story would make it better.	positive
878	1490384223	games	1	So all the ads was scammed ads want to make you play because it not kid friendly for little kids but yes I hope this app.  Can get rid of lot of boring scammed ads  it not same thing like the game because it VERY different to others game some ads was friendly some was not sois you see all most free picks it maybe a scammers apps games who want more money so people play forever and like some app going be fine but this year and 2019 wow shocking wow like this is very bad not good game for kid to play on it what devices  are them playing we want them to play good friendly good kids games not like this this game is dumber than others games I don't care what is it but we want everyone be safe stay home for long time and don‚Äôt buy game it a waste of time of your life stay and home and have better good day!	positive
879	1490384223	games	2	At first the game was kinda fun. Then in like level 6 or 7 is started getting boring. How am I supposed to know that a green bean would turn into a cannon? Or how am I supposed to know that a fishing rod would pull up a monster instead of a fish? How am I supposed to know that her phone is dead so she can‚Äôt call the police? You get my point. I deleted a few minutes after I started. Also this game is glitchy and slow, it was annoying. This game also made you restart the whole level instead of just the step you were on. This would make sense on a better, faster game, but this game is so slow it was just frustrating. You can try this game out, but I really don‚Äôt think you will keep it for more than 10 minutes.	negative
880	1490384223	games	3	There is so much ads and so stuff I don‚Äôt get first when she went on the wood it broke so fast and some other stuff so let‚Äôs get to the ads every level you pass there is a ad and there are small x to get out of the ad and we you get out of the game it makes you do the level you did already again and it is annoying and there are some glitches which will not make you pass the level something I like about this game is that they say other game like this other games you have to match to escape the first one or play it I don‚Äôt like the matching games I just want to play with out matching stuff so that something I like and there is more but not that much that is it	positive
881	1490384223	games	1	"I got this game because dot looked fun but pls no one download this game, it‚Äôs not worthy 4.3 rating it got, it features tedious and mundane gameplay with unrealistic scenarios in which the sensible option is never the right one!
Win or lose, there are ads, nasty ads like Kim Kardashian which literally everyone is advertising there is just an array of pointless ads scattered across the game that seems endless at first but only has like 66 levels and the girl.... who animated and made the character designs, this girl is prancing and cat-walking around the most dangerous locations in the world and smiling like and idiot, Lbh... this girl is really stupid and has no idea the danger she is in half of the time
If I could give a negative rating (like this that I mean -1 stars) and so on, this game would be most deserving of such.
Good day!"	negative
882	1490384223	games	2	There are way too many adds on here. I can‚Äôt even hear the celebration music of a completed level because of how quickly an add pops up. Also, I know this game isn‚Äôt based off of anything real, but some of the answers are just so un-logical that I don‚Äôt even understand how U was supposed to get a certain answer. And for some I have noticed that both options could have worked, (logically) but they still end up wrong. Like when the thief is chasing you on a scooter, the options are a bra, and a banana. I chose the banana, because I knew his wheels would most likely get either stuck on the peel, or slip on it. Instead, the scooter just drove right over it. Slightly confusing, how a bra can be any more effective than a banana peel? Thanks.	positive
883	1490384223	games	2	"This game is great and it wasn‚Äôt like the other games I‚Äôve downloaded that weren‚Äôt even what the ad was! This game doesn‚Äôt lie about it and I appreciate it! The only complaint I have    Is that there are SOO many ads! After every level there‚Äôs an ad and it gets super annoying! Like even when I didn‚Äôt even WANT to get 4x the amount I got I still had to watch a 30 second ad! This is one of the best/worst free mobile game on my device! It‚Äôs a good game but has more ads than ANY of the games on my device! I don‚Äôt know if you can fix it but if you can PLEASE do because it makes the game super not enjoyable! Again this would be a great game if there weren‚Äôt so many ads!

But I would NOT recommend this game at all!"	positive
884	1490384223	games	2	Well the first time I played this game, I thought it was a fun game and was wondering why people did not like it and made 1 star. So few days later, so much adds would come like right when you finished one, there would be a add and would just really bother me. It does not make sense! Just this game should make a few changes by making the girl less creepy and make it have sense like one was when there was a bear, and you could either choose honey comb or rose. I picked honey comb and the bee stung the bear. Like a bears fur is thick! Like none of this makes sense like whoever created this game, try to make it better and have more sense into the game. All though it is a pretty fun when you don‚Äôt get so annoyed of the adds.	positive
885	1490384223	games	1	This game is annoying and it makes no sense like on one level the zombie forest,FIRST OF ALL TF ARE YOU DOING IN A FOREST, at one part there are some bats in a bush...? You can use a candle or use a radio. So obviously I picked using the candle but SOMEHOW that‚Äôs wrong. So I restart the level and watch some stupid fricking add  and pick the radio and it plays some music? And the bats fly away... so I was supposed to know that a radio was gonna make bats fly away... first of all why are you tripping over bats????? Oh by the way, the animation is straight trash my dude like what were you thinking like are you using half your brain??? Like are you brain cells dead? Cuz the game makes no sense in anyway yet u gotta 4.3 star rating when all the comments are giving you 1 star and everybody is talking crap about your game, like	negative
886	1490384223	games	1	Why are they kidnapping that girl? She has a jacked up face and a stupid walk, who would want her? This game makes no sense and has hundreds of ads, I play one level where I have to tap once and I get an ad when I get it right, or an ad when I get it wrong. I also get choices to watch an ad to get an extra life and I don‚Äôt want the extra life and I still get an ad. How did this game get so many five star reviews? Fake people created by the developer! This game needs to be taken of the App Store and never thought of again. The only reason they thought of the idea of this game was because homescapes was false advertising this type of game, when really it it a tycoon, so they can get more downloads. Do not play this game.	negative
887	1490384223	games	5	My god, this is definitely the best game in the world. I can‚Äôt even tell how much I love that you (the developers of this amazing game) make this. Because every single time I saw a fake ad, I just thought of when someone will make the ad a reality, and you did it. And I‚Äôm so glad, that it was you, because I have loved every single game you do, and your games have help though a lot of difficult situations. I am definitely recommending this game to everyone, especially to my cousin, because we both agreed that this is the best idea and game in the App Store	positive
888	1490384223	games	4	The only problem I have with ‚ÄúSave the Girl‚Äù is there are way too many ads. Let‚Äôs say you get 8 choices wrong when you are playing. Then you have to watch 8 ads. It is completely unfair. What if the person playing is not good at decision making and they get every question wrong. Are you really going to make them do an ad every choice they get? Overall, though, I think ‚ÄúSave the Girl!‚Äù is a great game. If you don‚Äôt mind too many ads, I would recommend it. Thank you, for listening and thank you creators of ‚ÄúSave the Girl!‚Äô‚Äô because, I think this game is great! (Minus the ads)	positive
889	1490384223	games	3	There should be more. More characters a reason why she‚Äôs in these spaces and mostly a reason to make since. I like how we can choose the two options and how one causes her to get effected and one doesn‚Äôt, just like some of the scamming adds. But other wise, it should be more fun to take time out of your day and another reason to collect money other than trying another chance.  The other reason is, is that a lot of them don‚Äôt make since and are really cartoony and false. Just like how you chose to make a rainbow instead of the other reason. Thank you for creating this game but I‚Äôll gladly wait for further changes to occur. üòÑ	positive
890	1490384223	games	3	Although in the beginning this game was kinda logical but then as things continued it got very unrealistic, I do get that it‚Äôs a game and that it‚Äôs supposed to be crazy and different but the two choices don‚Äôt make sense most of the time, and the little scene parts are very short which soon leads to an ad which is also very irritating, one last thing is whenever the next button or restart button comes up it takes a while for that to happen which makes me personally a little impatient then I accidentally tap the restart button to the left, then I have to redo the whole skit and there‚Äôs no way to go back and do the next one in line.	negative
891	1490384223	games	1	The commercial for this app looked fun however the following is what you will experience when you actually play ( unless you fork over hard earned cash but who does that anymore ) lv1 your stuck in a chair use a lighter or scissors to free yourself. After you are forced to watch a 30second ad (for 2 seconds of game play. Lv2 escape from the room through the door useing an ac or a wood pice, after you are forced to watch another 30 second ad... you see where I‚Äôm going with this right? You will spend litterally 2 seconds playing 1 level and 30 seconds watching ads per level making some asswipe money off you. Insta deleted after reaching level 3 and yet another ad I was forced to watch ... 6total seconds of game play and 1m30sec of ads .	positive
892	1490384223	games	1	"So unlike Fishdom or Homescapes, this game is actually the game as advertised. But there are many problems. The game feels rushed, especially the levels. Also, there is an ad after every level, so you barely get to play the game. Plus, there are many mistakes that I found even before I got past level 3. Not only that, but the art style they used I feel doesn‚Äôt really look that great, and kids want something that is colorful and vibrant. Another thing, why is it a woman getting killed all the time? Not a good theme choice, especially in 2020.

Anyway, I don‚Äôt recommend this game, but I guess if you don‚Äôt mind ads, or how the game looks, then you might want to give it a try. But don‚Äôt be surprised if you delete it in about 2 minutes."	positive
893	1490384223	games	1	After every level that is like two seconds you get a really dumb ad. And the options are really dumb. For example one of the first two second levels the girl had to get over a hole and the options were a wooden plank or a bucket. The answer was a bucket but how I supposed to know there was cement in that bucket. And irl the cement would have taken hours if not days to dry. Then there was another level where she was on a raft and it was raining. The options were an umbrella or a tent. Somehow the answer was the tent. Like how are you going to use a tent on a raft. Also every time you earn a skin or something you have to watch an ad to claim it and if you fail a level you get the same dumb ad over and over again.	negative
894	1490384223	games	3	I‚Äôm not going to lie but this game is really fun to play it‚Äôs pretty addicting, but the only complaint i have is it has way too many ads. Whenever you finish a level an ad pops up immediately, it‚Äôs super annoying, when i first played i was fine with them but it got really irritating after, they also pop up when you get something wrong. Another complaint i have is that sometimes the things you have as choices don‚Äôt make sense sometimes, but it‚Äôs a game and a game could have anything. Bit aside from all this its really a fun game to play, but please notch the ads down a little.	positive
895	1490384223	games	3	"I was really excited to see someone finally made this type of game after all of those false ads from games like Gardenscapes etc. I was looking forward to a fun logic puzzle where you have to figure out the best course of action.
This is just an absurd guessing game. There‚Äôs no logic to it. Put on a propeller hat to fly away on a scooter? Use an eraser to erase a tank? What?
It‚Äôs not a puzzle, there really isn‚Äôt a way to logically figure out what the right answer is. You pretty much just guess and see what ridiculous thing happens. It‚Äôs good to kill a couple minutes, but it gets boring quick with no thought put into it. Uninstalling."	negative
896	1490384223	games	5	overall this game is really fun! i love playing it while at home during quarantine. it‚Äôs a nice way to pass time. anyways, i‚Äôve been reading some of the reviews and lots of people have been complaining about all the advertisements. well guess what? I FOUND A HACK TO THE ADS! simply turn off your wifi and play the game! without wifi it can‚Äôt give you any ads! you can play the game peacefully! i tried this hack and i didn‚Äôt get a single ad! please use my hack and no not waste your money on the no ads! YOU‚ÄôRE WELCOME! :)	positive
897	1490384223	games	4	It‚Äôs the game that so many ads like gardenscape or fishdom fake their ads to be. This game is actually like that. You get the choose to pick one or the other to save the girl. But there‚Äôs an ad literally after every single level like sheesh. That‚Äôs the only thing that makes the game not fun. I would understand if it was every two or three levels but like after every single level or if you get it wrong. And the levels take like maybe 30 seconds to complete so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a long level. The ads are just too much	positive
898	1490384223	games	1	"Ok, if you play this game it is like the worst.  First of all she has a dress that shows her üçí and what If a little kid sees this they would be thinking out of the box.

899	1490384223	games	4	This game isn‚Äôt too bad. There‚Äôs only two things that‚Äôs kind of annoying. 1) too much ads. After you complete or fail another level then a new ad shows up. 2) it‚Äôs unrealistic. For example, on one level you had to get over a hole. You could either choose a rat or a balloon. I picked balloon, but it popped in the middle of gliding over the hole. The correct answer was the rat because it would scare the woman and she would jump over the hole. It‚Äôs unrealistic because you can‚Äôt jump that far over a hole just because you‚Äôre scared of something.	negative

I credit Hangouts Desktop for helping me stay in touch with family throughout the day while at work. Given Facebook‚Äôs reputation I really don‚Äôt want to have to switch to Facebook Messenger after you guys shutdown Hangouts. Hangouts Chat doesn‚Äôt make sense for my family and friends because then everyone makes their own workspace for every single group of friends. Making chat groups on Hangouts has always been faster, and don‚Äôt die off like so many Slack workspaces made just for certain friend groups. I don‚Äôt need a work space and bunch of channels for my drinking buds. Hangouts chat groups have always worked better for more informal back and forth. Hangouts is your most popular messaging platform. There are probably so many others like me that would like to use Hangouts so they don‚Äôt have to move over to Facebook. Hangouts is popular! Why not use Hangouts as a way of guiding people into Hangouts Chat? When people are starting a group chat, offer to those users to convert the group chat to a Hangouts Chat workspace. I mean, you have access to all these users. Integrate GPay into Hangouts. SOMETHING. There‚Äôs value here! Microsoft would kill for a messaging platform as popular as Hangouts!	positive

It‚Äôs all like the regular texting app, but you can also call using the same app, which is pretty convenient. The regular app does not include calling, and you need two apps if you want to call. You can also switch from voicemail to FaceTime, instead of having to call again if you want to FaceTime. Group chat let‚Äôs you talk as a group in a voicemail or FaceTime, and all of the people can decide if they want either voice only or camera. If you don‚Äôt have the new update for group chat on your device, that‚Äôs ok! You don‚Äôt need to update to group chat on Hangouts. Overall, this app totally deserves five stars. As an addition, I like the little cyclops guy that you see if there is nothing there. Hey, it‚Äôs cute and makes the app pop out more. The logo is a dialog bubble with quotations (‚Äú) in it, which is a pretty clever idea because the app is about chat. If you are reading this and you don‚Äôt have Hangouts, get it right now. You better. And if you already do, then give yourself a pat on the back. I‚Äôm so glad I found this app, and I hope you decide to use the app too. Applause to the creator of this app. üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª You deserve it.	positive

Then today, October 20th 2019, I was refreshing hangouts and signing out of my account meaning to sign back in and it would be refreshed. I do this a lot, because then after I sign back in I can see my friends‚Äô changed profile pictures, etc. I had also just installed the IOS 12.4.2 update on my device. A screen I had never seen before popped up that said, ‚ÄúWelcome! Hangouts will save all of your recorded conversation history so you can access it anywhere you need to.‚Äù Then at the bottom of the screen there was a big blue button that read, ‚ÄúOK, got it!‚Äù I pressed that button. At first it didn‚Äôt work and I assumed it was a tiny glitch and wasn‚Äôt a big deal. I waited. I tried again. I did it again. It still wasn‚Äôt working. I restarted my device, deleted and re-installed hangouts, cleared all my windows and checked my internet connection, which was full bars. I‚Äôm still trying to figure out why it won‚Äôt work. At the time, I cannot contact any of the people I would want to contact. Please help me! I love this app and need it to work!	positive
903	643496868	social	5	"So... I graduated college in 2009 from University of Oklahoma. I had a group of 8 guys that were best of friends. We all moved to various parts of the country afterwards for jobs, girls, etc. We were out of touch for a few years - except for the occasional Fantasy Football trash talking during 4 months/yr. 

We joined Hangouts in 2012 and have been chatting on this daily (yes... daily) since then. Marriages, kids & all of life‚Äôs struggles & achievements have been chronicled since. There may only be a few short chats a day or entire pages & pages of back & forth. Google Hangouts has been the one place that has kept us guys connected and best of friends since college. Also, probably the reason we could never run for office one day if we wanted...lol... but that‚Äôs neither here nor there. 

Highly recommend this chatting app and hope it never goes away. Lastly, one of the only apps I know that offers Video Chat for up to 10 people at once. We‚Äôve played fantasy football bets & drinking games on more than a few occasions with all 8 of us on the video chat. Super Cool."	positive
904	643496868	social	5	"Is a laugh to read all the fake reviews and nonsense that kids are writing to hype Duo.  Hangouts is obviously a full-featured, all-around cross-platform app, while Duo is little more than a one-trick pony (OK... let's give it the two-trick benefit-of-doubt here.) Hangouts allows voice calls with all mobile and landline voice numbers, with no Hangouts app needed by the other parties. Hangouts supports texting between any phone numbers that allow texting - again without a Hangouts app needed by the others. Hangouts ONLY requires using the app or website to do video calls with others.

The quality of Duo video IS generally better than Hangouts video, but that alone certainly doesn't make up for Duo's major limitation of no connectivity of any kind, to most phone numbers. (Duo uses phone numbers only for identifying which Duo apps to connect together.) ALL parties must be using a Duo app or the website. You definitely won't be calling all phone numbers with the very limited Duo app."	positive
905	643496868	social	5	I‚Äôve been using this app for three years now and it works pretty good. There are times when it glitches out (the screen freezes, the keyboard disappears, messages won‚Äôt send etc) but those glitches are less common now. When it comes to video chatting in large groups, sometimes it overloads it and everyone freezes but that can be fixed by everyone (except for one person) hanging up and re-joining. There was one time when the video chatting system barely worked but that was a while ago. Overall, it‚Äôs a really useful app for people who can‚Äôt afford phones or data because it can be used on almost any device. Half the time I forget I‚Äôm using an app and just feel like I‚Äôm texting instead. Oh, and the screen will show who is there in the chat with you, when a message was wrote, and if someone is typing or deleting something in a message. I always found that to be a fun and useful feature.	positive
906	643496868	social	5	"I use this app to chat with my buddies informally. Your new apps, Chat and Meet, split hangouts for no apparent reason, into a video app and a text app. Why...? I am completely baffled. Please explain why these new professional apps are better than the tried-and-true hangouts. What split into two apps anyway? You did this with Drive, Docs, Slides, etc as well.

Also, my friend (the one I talk via hangouts with) is trying to get me to move to Discord. Just saying, a lot of people will move to different apps when you kill it. And they won‚Äôt be your two new ones.

Also: the bugs are racking up. It‚Äôs been saying that several messages (around 10) send since yesterday are ‚Äúsending‚Äù despite my friend already having seen and responded to them. And the sendrates are getting slower. Please, just kill it quickly if you have to, instead of letting it bleed out slowly from the bugs and lags."	negative
907	643496868	social	5	"I‚Äôve been using hangouts for about five years now and I love it. It for sure works better on Samsung or LG products than I phone products, but there isn‚Äôt a huge difference. Sometimes it just takes a little longer to load. I like that I‚Äôm able to use it on my phone and on my laptop. I love pretty much everything about it except the new emojis. The new emojis are scary looking, I prefer the old ones. 

I‚Äôve made new friends through this outlet. I even eventually met my boyfriend through this huge group chat I had started with people I knew. Those people added some people they knew and I just remember laughing a lot. I‚Äôm also able to keep in touch with a friend I met from Switzerland. My whole immediate family uses it too, we have a family group chat! 

If the app creators are ever looking to improve it though, they should revert back to the old emojis and maybe add some gifs. I highly recommend this app!"	positive
908	643496868	social	4	I love how hangouts is a very useful texting and communicating app, so I will recommend this to nearly everyone. Because of its usefulness, quick sending, and how my friends also enjoy this. However there a couple of problems with this app. First is that the app only allows you to use gmail accounts. Now I am not saying that iCloud or anything is better then gmail, but the fact that some people may not be able to use this is really sad just because the email didn‚Äôt work out. Another problem is, is that sometimes when I or my friend sends messages myself and my friend can not see the text messages unless we log out and then back in. This fact is very disturbing that I am not able to read the message until I log out. But anyway besides these facts that I hope will be considered and used in the next update I think that this is an AMAZING app! I hope you enjoy this app and have fun texting your friends! :D	positive
909	643496868	social	5	This app is perfect if your phone got cut off or if you have no money to get service. I'm able to send and receive text messages and make and receive calls without having a phone carrier. And in my book, that's wicked awesome. So far I haven't had any technical issues with the app, it's never crashed or froze on me. And I've had a Google voice number since they first came out, I highly recommend getting one. You have to have a working number to set it up with tho but after that it stays on even if your phone gets cut off. And you can call your number from another number and then make an outgoing call that will show up as your number on the receiving phone. So that's really cool. All in all I've just been very pleased with my Google voice and Hangouts experience. Thanks Google! You have saved me from being cut off from communication!	positive
910	643496868	social	4	"We‚Äôve recently switched to Hangouts for our virtual music lessons. I love the no-nonsense layout, and as long as you have headphones, the audio quality is comparable to other video conferencing platforms. Here‚Äôs the good:

- user friendly, especially for youth. It‚Äôs a familiar layout and easy to navigate. Especially for those with limited app/tech experience
- very responsive (with good internet) and for teaching, it‚Äôs nice to be in a live chat and also have the ability to send photos and files in the messaging system. 
- the ability to make groups is awesome
- works great across all devices 
- unlike some other platforms, you do not have to send a ‚Äúchat link‚Äù by email. Just a message within the app itself.

The bad:
- having a new contact go to your ‚Äúinvites‚Äù tab instead of your messages tab is confusing and led to a lot of lost calls in the beginning. 
- does not seem to play well with Safari on a computer. People trying to call through Safari tend to get a white screen and have to either switch web browsers (Chrome or Firefox) or dig around their permissions to allow Hangouts increased functionality.
- sometimes the incoming call only shows up as an active gray bar within the chat itself. Misleading to new users. This only happens if the app is currently open and the chat is open. Not the end of the world, just easy to miss the call.

Hope this helps!"	positive
911	643496868	social	5	"I absolutely love using Google Hangouts! Since 2016, I‚Äôve been using this app and have gotten countless peers to download and use it as well! As a university student, it has allowed me to effectively communicate with the many groups I‚Äôve had to work with throughout the semesters. It makes group meetings a breeze, as you can track who is in the conversation, it eliminates the need for keeping minutes as the conversations are saved in their entirety until you decide to leave the group chat, and the voice and video call features are easy to use. I love that you can participate with only voice in the video option! 

Overall, Google Hangouts is by far my number one chat app! If you don‚Äôt have it, or think ‚ÄúYeah okay, it‚Äôs just like messenger, or all the rest,‚Äù you‚Äôre wrong! You should definitely download and use this app regularly!! I‚Äôd give it 10 stars if I could!"	positive
912	643496868	social	5	This texting app is seriously the best. The interface is bright and friendly, the controls are easy and reliable, and there‚Äôs like, NO LAG! It doesn‚Äôt show when you read a text‚Äîgreat for ignoring people or not telling someone that you‚Äôre up. It comes with 100+ extra cute emojis and GIFs, and it keeps all the regular emojis too! You can change your profile picture easily, add a caption (if you want), and if you know how, you can make yours animated (by making it into a GIF, and choosing it from your google drive). I have been using this app since i was nine: its totally appropriate and safe. I probably use this more than any other messaging app on my device. You can also video chat with multiple people, and even call them. EVEN IF YOU ARE ON AN IPAD. You can CALL!!! This app is totally worth getting, and its free! So why not go ahead, and buy it?	positive
913	643496868	social	3	"I've been using Google Hangouts since 2013 as one of my main forms of communication. I've liked the interface for all the years I've used it and all of the improvements from sending multiple photos to sending your location to your friend(s), to even the animated emoji gumdrop gifs that you could send dubbed ""stickers"" (which are still cute as hell)!

It's basically a triple threat app that needs to still be relevant if Google expects to compete with Apple in any way. It has FaceTime, Phone, and iMessage all in one and it's taken for granted every single day as it loses support for the newer apps like Allo and Duo.

It's frustrating to see Allo and Duo catch on when they're two separate apps that can do what Hangouts has been doing for years.

Keep it around, update it, don't let it die!

Update: On iOS 11.0.3, it seems it‚Äôs having some issues with photos? Whenever I try to go to my photos directly inside the app and share a photo, it won‚Äôt let me. It‚Äôll tell me to Cancel or Choose, and when I tap Choose, it slide over and shows the photo with no way to go back to typing or viewing my conversation. I have to forcibly close the app. Another issue would be that it won‚Äôt let me share my gifs via the share extension. It does allow me to share, but it freezes the gifs in place, making them a still.

I hope you guys resolve this problem. It‚Äôs a great app that still deserves support."	positive
914	643496868	social	4	"Sometimes hangouts will just decide that they aren‚Äôt going to deliver any of my messages to a particular contact. And I cannot send messages to them on hangouts from my phone unless I delete the app and redownload it.

It usually starts when I try to send the message when I don‚Äôt have great service. Instead of just holding onto it and sending it when I get in service, or showing ‚Äúmessage send fail‚Äù it actually just says ‚Äúsending....‚Äù into perpetuity. It never sends it. And it never marks as send fail. This has happened 3-4 times, and don‚Äôt understand why. It doesn‚Äôt change when I do a full restart of the phone. And yet, when I message the person from my desktop/gmail website, it not only sends, but the sent message appears on my hangouts app in real time. I just can‚Äôt respond from the app. 

Please fix this bug!"	positive
915	643496868	social	2	this app is crap compared to messenger and that is really saying something. on iphone6 it is nearly impossible to even see the messages due to the tiny strip of screen which remains when one has the keyboard up to type (the resolution is formatted for longer screens). the kb is supposed to swipe down but doesnt work easily. it creates a lot of lag and is frustrating. it also doesnt let one select multiple pictures for a message, so one has to send them one at a time. and fhere is no tab to see photos one has sent, like messenger. there are also no reacts on messages which do come in handy and save some time and typing. anyway it is /ok/, i suppose. it‚Äôs just about usable but not at all high calibre. very beta and glitchy. i would have expected better quality from google. you own the internet, ya think you could make a decent messenging app. oh also the sticker oacks are weird and ugly lol.

916	643496868	social	3	I‚Äôve been using this app three years, and until a few days ago I have had no complaints. But three days ago, I opened hangouts and found I had been locked out of the account I use for %90 of my conversations (it is a school account which I use because the school gives everyone an email address and most of my friends just use that email and don‚Äôt have a personal one). This has happened before, so I immediately went to the ‚Äúadd account‚Äù option. After completing the process it sent me back to the home screen with a little message reading ‚Äúunable to add account‚Äù. I went through this process multiple times on both of the devices I use hangouts on, and found that it won‚Äôt let me add any other emails. I have tried to find helpful videos and websites and haven‚Äôt had luck, and I would vastly appreciate advice and explanation from the Hangouts team.	positive

This is one of the best apps ever. I would recommend it!! I love the kitty stickers. I like to send them to relatives. They are funny. I also like that you can select the pictures you want to send to them. Whenever I want to call them, this wonderful app is able to call them! There is also FaceTiming. This app is a very good app, but sometimes I regret texting on it. There are big things like  when I type in a email then it pops up two. I always click the wrong one. Please fix that. I would give this app 5 star if you fixed that. Another thing that I want them to fix is they should have one more stickers. In conclusion, this is one of the best apps ever!

919	643496868	social	5	I‚Äôve been using google hangouts for almost 8 years now and I love it. I got to choose my own number and my number didn‚Äôt change even though I had stopped using hangouts for quite some time. My number wasn‚Äôt recycled or given to someone else like most of the other texting and calling apps. With google hangouts once you get your number that‚Äôs your number forever until you decide to either delete your google hangouts account or change the number yourself, and even after you die the number will still be yours. I love hangouts and I‚Äôd seriously recommend that everyone should have a google hangouts app and number.

920	643496868	social	5	I have just graduated with my masters and after 6 years of use, I can attest that the suite of apps by google are smooth and easy and efficient. The only issues that ever arise have been with much older people that still use AOL or other outdated browsers and communication systems. The suite has fast and lite functionality for the whole team. MS office systems are slow and sketchy by comparison. Excel still has more functionality, but hardly anyone uses it anymore. Hangouts is an allin one solution for communication across teams. I can work on any system all day, sharing tools and screens, docs, and making meeting notes. Everyone gets connected and stuff gets done. It‚Äôs a major corporate conference tool at the google speed and availability. Use it or be an oldie that thinks the internet is just hype.	positive
921	643496868	social	4	This app is very nice to communicate to people who don‚Äôt have numbers and only emails. There is an option to show if we are online or offline. Most of my contacts in Hangouts have that feature on. But, one person has two accounts synced to one email (Or one email synced to two accounts I think it‚Äôs both the same) and it NEVER gives me an accurate answer if she‚Äôs active or not. Sometimes, the icon of her profile picture fades and comes back repeatedly even with a chat bubble saying she‚Äôs typing, I don‚Äôt get a reply. And when I check, it says she‚Äôs active, I check AGAIN 20 minutes later.. it says she‚Äôs active! Then an hour later, it says she was active 2 hours ago. And I don‚Äôt understand why.

That is why I am confused with why Hangouts is going to get cut‚Äî students can connect through hangouts, and is one of the few messaging systems available for everyone (Messages require having a phone, Facebook has strict rules about age and name, and other social networking doesn‚Äôt have messaging systems as universal and useful as Hangouts). Overall, I would say Google Hangouts is a wonderful plus to the online community, and because of the fact that it is email-based, everyone can use it. Please don‚Äôt get rid of hangouts!	positive

I would click on the app and as I was about to message a friend, the app crashed and would act stupid. However, the app is just fine. It only has crashed on me about 4-5 times. I think that should be improved. Also, I feel like the ring tone can get annoying at times, so if they had options for ring tones, that would be much better. Other than that, the app is really good and I recommend it to chat with your friends, family, and other people.

I‚Äôd also suggest adding excellent support for audio/video (multimedia) files as the particular type of files are always great to have ability to send and receive. Audio/video files should look appealing within the app to assure a seamless and enjoyable experience. Also, please look into updating the app to be as visually pleasing to the eye as possible because of the new OS for the latest devices.

926	643496868	social	4	A lot of my friends don‚Äôt have phones compatible with iMessage, so hangouts has been a really convenient way to communicate. I have, however, encountered a few minor problems. Whenever my group and I have issues calling, we have to make an entirely new group chat in order to get it running again. Thankfully, this has only happened a couple times, but I still feel it‚Äôs something worth mentioning. I also wanted to note how certain users‚Äô profile pictures stop appearing after a certain amount of time. This is usually fixed after deleting and redownloading the app, although it still isn‚Äôt ideal. Aside from those two things, the app runs great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an app compatible with different smart phones.	positive

Sometimes it fails to notify me if someone messages me, making me miss their message for over an hour. And it also continues to delete conversations. This annoys me a lot. I know it may be for space or compatibility but I still don‚Äôt like it. And it sometimes doesn‚Äôt send my messages causing me to have to resend it. ALSO, it won‚Äôt let me send images. I keep trying over and over but I just deletes it and says ‚ÄúFailed to send‚Äù even though it didn‚Äôt even try. Fix these please and I‚Äôll give you 5.

The only issue I have noticed is in video calls, our video will sometimes turn off, and it is difficult to get it back on. It often comes back on its own eventually, but it is annoying. That may be an issue with the WiFi and not with the app,  but perhaps look into it to see if there‚Äôs a way to fix the issue.
I would like to be able to exit the app while videocalling, without it turning the video off. 
In short, the only things I‚Äôve noticed are connected to videocalling, and even those aren‚Äôt enough to make me stop using the app."	negative
929	643496868	social	2	"This app has definitely come a long way from when it was still Google Voice.

On more than one occasion, I find out later someone has sent me a video but I didn't even get an error message acknowledging any message was attempted so I wasn't aware. Please add video soon. Or even just email us the video! Everything loads so slowly if it ever gets through.

Sometimes, I get repeated messages twice in a row. And other times messages are lagged or out of order and don't appear until I manually exit and enter the app again. I have to do that to refresh the app it seems.

Currently, it won‚Äôt let me send any messages. It keeps saying ‚ÄúFailed to send. Touch to retry.‚Äù So I can‚Äôt even use the app to send out anything for hours now."	negative

I am a kid that likes easy and simple to use apps, and this is one of them. I love all the ways to have chats and all the multi person calls. This app is an amazing app to use for studying with your friends.

931	643496868	social	5	So, I really like hangouts. I would never use anything else. It makes texting easy and you can even multitask pretty well. I like how that when you get a notification you can just reply straight from there. (Hold it down) It lets you send images and screenshot. You can even switch accounts and have 2 different texting platforms. You can also make groups with up to WHO knows how many people. What‚Äôs also great is that it is completely lag free! I have 1 complaint though. You can‚Äôt send images while in a video call. I mean, I get it, but like, what if you have an image that you can‚Äôt show in the call like a screenshot? But overall, hangouts is a great app and I would definitely recommend it to everyone.	positive
932	643496868	social	5	Hello Google, just wanted to say I‚Äôve been using this app since mid-March of 2019 and it has been the best. I didn‚Äôt know about this app until me and my partner tried to look for a texting-only app that reduces our data usage. The stickers are amazing, and so are the notifications and ringtone sounds. Only small thing I don‚Äôt like is taking pictures: it snaps the pic and instantly sends it without previewing. Another thing would be that for me, if my phone is ever turned off and I turn it on again, I open this app and it comes out as the welcome screen and it loads for minutes unless if I exit the app and go back in to find it normal. Once again thank you for making this app and please don‚Äôt get rid of it!	positive
933	643496868	social	5	I am so grateful for Hangouts! My son is in Sierra Leone West Africa for 2 years and this is our main source of communication with him. As soon as he is set up in an Internet cafe and online, he initiates the chat. We have a group set up and as soon as we see his message, we jump! Our whole family, who is scattered around is able to get on and we can chat if able. If not, we can read what we have missed and join in when we can. It‚Äôs our lifeline but better yet, our heart-line! We can‚Äôt do video chats because the computers in the cafes don‚Äôt have cameras but we are happy to able to live chat with him, send pics instantly, laugh, cry and all the rest. Thank you so much for allowing this amazing service! It‚Äôs a gift!	positive

I have been a user of Google Hangouts for some time. I‚Äôm a user both on the iOS platform as well as on PC and Mac platforms. I think it‚Äôs an understated and underutilized product.

For those that have experience in Asia, Line here is very dominant. Google Hangouts has characteristics of Line, Skype, and iMessage. I feel it's a productivity multiplier because I can be work in any laptop OS (and I suppose even on Linux) and work interchangeably with a mobile platform. I critically find it useful with students or colleagues I'm collaborating with as it allows me to stay in a Google workflow for efficiency. I will warn you once you start using it on a computer platform, you probably find yourself using a lot.

So why isn‚Äôt Google promoting this in a better manner? My guess, like a lot of things they purchase, it was an acquisition incorporated into their ecosystem, but they haven't done a great job of differentiating or promoting it. I would ask Google to keep this app. If you haven't tried it, kick the tires on this app/service either on your phone or on a browser on which you're logged into Google."	positive
935	643496868	social	1	"Needs work and polish to make better translations and be user friendly, dependable, integrated with google voice. Google voice and hangouts should complement each other where useful, and stand alone where different but useful on own. And parts that that aren‚Äôt broke, or work already should be left alone if not broke. Some things were more intuitive and useful in the past, than they are now; since some tweaks after past updates?  Privacy and security need to be increased and less invasive data farming. Still make the most of what is. Phone numbers need to be protected and insured that in certain situations can maintain regardless of use, etc. 

On a positive note, do appreciate what can do with and options available that did not have, before created. Thanks

Just with all your talent it seems to have way more potential for community, benefits and overall Win/Win situation for both the individual, groups and google overall."	positive
936	643496868	social	4	"I haven‚Äôt had the chance to even see my friends for at least two weeks now. But, with Hangouts, we are able to do video calls (usually a normal thing that happens daily over this break) and catch up with each other. We can also enable the camera option if we want to see each other, and enable mute if we have to do something that might sound annoying to the people we are chatting to.

The only problem I‚Äôve had with it is that the audio sometimes glitches out and you can‚Äôt really distinguish what the other person is saying, and sometimes the website on computers crash and make everything glitched for at least ten minutes (probably not related to the app), but besides that, it‚Äôs a real life saver."	negative
937	643496868	social	4	I use this app on a daily basis and it‚Äôs probably one of the best chatting apps out there. I love the fact that you can add anyone you want via email, and it‚Äôs super easy as well! I also enjoy that you can see when each message was sent and such, but there‚Äôs one thing that makes this app difficult to use. On any mobile divide I use, new or old, big or small, it always seems to lag heavily and crash easily even when I‚Äôm just simply sending texts to my best friend. What really bothered me the most was when it took me over a minute just to turn off the notifications for a group chat I was on. If there is any solution to this problem I am open to hear it because this lag issue is starting to get frustrating.	positive
938	643496868	social	5	"I love hangouts! I‚Äôm 13 years old and I use it all the time to contact my friends. It is also helpful with gathering homework during the school year with friends. You don‚Äôt need a phone number to use it, just an email account. It has a nice layout, and YOU get to decide your profile pic. I also have iMessage, but I personally like hangouts better. 
 One problem: hangouts doesn‚Äôt allow you to have different ringtones for different people, which is why sometimes I use iMessage more.
  Another problem: IT KEEPS CRASHING! I would be grateful if you could fix this. I‚Äôm writing this review because hangouts just crashed.
   Please consider adding ringtone choices and fixing the crashes.

939	643496868	social	4	This app has become very useful recently. I have and use apple devices, but for some reason, a lot of my friends use androids. I obviously can‚Äôt text them in Apple Messages, but this substitutes that. You can text, call and more with this app. I am not sponsored lol. Another feature is that it actually doesn‚Äôt require a phone number. You can sign into the app with your Gmail account, and it will ask for your phone number, but if you don‚Äôt want to, you can skip it and it won‚Äôt bug you. One thing that would be great to add would be the ability to edit the names of the people you text. It won‚Äôt change anything on anyone elses device, but some of my friends gmails aren‚Äôt their real names. This is why it gets four stars.	positive
940	643496868	social	5	I think handouts is a fun and cool way to talk to friends and family I like how you can do other activities and games while you calling you best buds!üòÅthe  only thing I would recommend knowing before you get all excited is that you must be invited to your friends hangout calls. Another thing is that you have to be prepared to know how to use it 1.) you can either invite others to a call of your 2.) you press join and wait till your peeps pick up you callü•≥3.) if they don‚Äôt pick up you can invite a smaller number of people in your call or you can enjoy hanging out with you friends and family! See easy! A fun and easy way to hang out with friends from home but better	positive
941	643496868	social	4	"Had to D/L this App to be part of a virtual video conference back in ‚Äò09.  Normally, I despise being told what to do/ use, not this time. Because I ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù Google‚Äôs Hangouts!  And I‚Äôve been using it ever since.
  To give the haters a lil justification, it‚Äôs not perfect. But overall, it‚Äôs gets the job(s) done that it used to take several Apps to accomplish.  Currently there might be a single App solution available that‚Äôs on par/ better than this, I haven‚Äôt checked. Mostly because (IDK about you, but) I‚Äôm just not into giving ‚ÄúCart Blanche‚Äù permissions to every small App developer that comes along.
  I recommend this App if you‚Äôre looking for another solution to SMS, MMS, phone calls and video calls via VOIP (strictly over the Internet).  At very least, it‚Äôs safe to install and give it a go."	positive
942	643496868	social	5	"Okay so I‚Äôve been using this app for a long time. Nothing strange happened before until I got a message from some random email. They kept saying I know where you live and so I got creeped out. I looked up the email and I found out it‚Äôs a killer and so I instantly deleted the app, but it would delete. Now I‚Äôm freaking out because somebody knows where I live!! 
A few days passed without the person texting me and I started to hear knocks on my door I ignored them until one night it became louder. So I opened the door and a tall man dressed up like a Visco Girl and he threw metal straws at me and kept yelling SKSKSKSKS. I still have scares from where he stabbed me with those straws. 

(This app is actually really good)"	negative
943	643496868	social	5	I have an iPad, so, during COVID-19, I could only contact my friends through email, and there are two flaws with email. One is that you can‚Äôt video chat, so I couldn‚Äôt see my friends‚Äô faces, and two is that they won‚Äôt know immediately that I‚Äôve contacted them, so we wouldn‚Äôt be able to have a fast conversation. Hangout changed that for me! There are times when we are video chatting and our screens turn off, and we can only see the person‚Äôs profile, so we have to turn the screen on and off again. But that is such a little and solvable flaw, so I still give this app 5 stars! Thank you for being awesome, Hangout!	positive
944	643496868	social	4	More often than not, Hangouts is the app I suggest to my friends and family to communicate on. The DMs/messaging work great, and it‚Äôs relatively easy to maneuver. The only problem is the calling. My home have relatively good WiFi. I‚Äôve even gotten comments about it from my friends. My girlfriend lives in another country so we wanted to try calling on Hangouts one day. It worked miserably. The cameras on both ends kept shutting off, and we had to keep re-calling because the audio cut out as well. I even have a friend who lives in the same neighborhood as me, and sometimes the audio is so bad, that we also have to repetitively keep calling each other. Please fix this! I love hangouts to much, and I‚Äôve used it for a long time.	positive
945	643496868	social	5	We use Google Suite in my businesses, and hangouts really makes life a lot easier. There‚Äôs a missing feature that I find kind of annoying though. I‚Äôm always logged in to my 4 different gmail accounts, but the account selector tiles in settings often display in a frustrating way. In my opinion, it should show you the current account that you have selected first, and then show you any account that have unread messages as the next account. Why? I find that I‚Äôm constant having to select an account just to make the tiles shift so I can select the account that has unread messages. This is only a problem for people with 4 or more accounts.	negative
946	643496868	social	5	"I recommend this so much if you or a friend have just a computer and can‚Äôt text. You can honestly text on computer, phone, iPads, or whatever ya got. Me and my friends don‚Äôt have things other than computers half of the time when I have an iPad for school and that. It works amazingly. Although it could be a little better if they allow more emojis and that. 
My friends and I have gotten closer because before we would only see each other at the least once every two weeks. This made us text and ask how our day has been and learn about each other. I love it. 
Also I don‚Äôt do WiFi which is fine, just getting that point out."	positive
947	643496868	social	5	OK most people think that Apple it‚Äôs much better than Google hangouts. That‚Äôs wrong because guess what you can actually facetime with more than five people at once. So you can have a huge FaceTime as a Group and it actually works and apple is horrible trying to FaceTime a whole group .when I tried FaceTime ing only two friends at the same time it wouldn‚Äôt let me talk to any of them and it didn‚Äôt even show their faces which I thought was just horrible. I say Google hangouts is much better than Apple because you can send on any Internet even if it‚Äôs a locked Internet or unsecured Internet you can still send but Apple you cannot. so I give it a big old fat five	positive
948	643496868	social	4	"Hangouts is my main chatting app that I use with all of my friends. All my group chats and private chats, all with their own interesting histories are all stored there.
 There are a few issues, like how it lags when there are too many people messaging in a chat, doesn‚Äôt always accurately show if someone is online, and doesn‚Äôt allow us to delete individual messages. 
However, those issues aside, it‚Äôs a great chatting app that I use for all purposes, from chatting with friends to meeting new friends to discussing group projects and class work. I heard that Hangouts might get closed in the future, which would be such a pity since it‚Äôs so widely used in my neighborhood. Please don‚Äôt close Hangouts!"	positive
949	643496868	social	5	"Hangouts easily lets me talk to my friends and family. Hangouts even let me meet new people and one of the hem is now my best friend because we met on a group chat, before she was a girl I never talked to but now I can‚Äôt stop texting her or talking to her. This app lets you talk to people who don‚Äôt have a email or you just don‚Äôt want their email for just one project but you can call them, the app asks you to pay but the call is high quality. You can have amazing video calls with friends but to be honest hangouts calls can be a little shaky or your voice breaks a lot.

I sooo recommend you to get this app and it free! 
Love it and I am not payed to right this.... just saying..."	positive
950	1438670520	travel	1	Where do I begin? First off, my flight was cancelled due to bad weather. I called customer service to see what my options were. The employee I talked to was very nice however, she could not rebook me on a similar flight. My original flight was from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico to Orlando. I was told that they could refund my money. That truly is not an option because I‚Äôm on vacation and need to get home. So I asked her if there was an alternate flight. The only viable solution was to leave out of San Juan the following day (an hour and a half out of the way) and arrive in Ft. Lauderdale. I had paid extra for 2 big seats in the front of the airplane. I asked her if she could give me the same seats and she replied that I couldn‚Äôt get row 2 but I could get row 6 which would be the same (I later found out that is a lie). So I said that‚Äôs fine. She informed me that I also have a $36 credit that will expire in October for a future flight (not gonna happen) because of a price difference. So now I‚Äôve been trying to check in for this flight that I‚Äôm reluctantly trying to get on which I have doubts is going to leave or not and the app is frozen/crashing. It‚Äôs very frustrating! I was able to check in on the website (I think) but I want to have my boarding passes on my phone because I have no access to a printer. Heaven forbid I go to the airport tomorrow and pay $10 per ticket to print it out! Maybe I‚Äôll use my $36 credit...what a joke airline!	positive
951	1438670520	travel	5	"I was supposed to fly out of Tampa International, heading to Nashville Tennessee at 11:25am this morning and I unfortunately missed my flight. 
When I got to the Spirit counter, the Spirit Agent, Millie, was SO helpful to me; she completely took care of getting me rebooked, I had to do nothing! I pulled up my app and the flight was just there and ready for me to check-in.
 In addition, Millie, in a time of great stress for me and a broken right wrist, was able to calm me and it seemed natural for her, as part of her personality. 
She went above and beyond her call of duty, and as a past supervisor, I would like to just say that I do hope she is compensated well, as it would be a great loss to the airline to lose such a valuable employee. In fact, Millie has made me a frequent flyer of this airline now; this was my first time flying with Spirit.
Thank you, Millie, for taking a very difficult circumstance for me and actually turning it into a pleasure.... that kind of customer service is rare these days, so know that you are very much appreciated."	positive
952	1438670520	travel	1	"This is the worst app ever especially for a frequent flyer on all airlines. The first flight to our destination city Spirit is flying. App crashes every single time if not when opening as soon as the first click down it goes and disappears. Can‚Äôt get boarding passes, buy luggage (nice surprise a charge for a carry on) or change seats can‚Äôt do anything in an app that crashes every single time. 

Go on the website and it‚Äôs just as horrible. It‚Äôs hard to navigate, most links don‚Äôt work, can‚Äôt check in either but was able to buy seats and again luggage since they charge for that too even though everyone has a carry on. Once you add up the cost it‚Äôs not any cheaper than other discount carriers and with advanced purchases nor the major airline. 

Lastly when we called to see why the app crashes or the website don‚Äôt work and want to check in, there‚Äôs another 25 buck charge for that too, wow. So now we will have to wait in the long lines to get paper tickets which is more than frustrating and we‚Äôre also TSA pre-approved so instead of zipping through the process which we‚Äôve paid to do now our onboarding will take forever. This is the first and last time we will fly with Spirit!!!"	positive
953	1438670520	travel	2	The app okay. I was able to look at my flight time and boarding passes (it did not crash on me like other users seem to deal with). However, I wanted to move our seats on our flight, so I did that. But then it never updated our boarding pass with the new seats I chose. Instead, the pass check to ‚Äúcheck at gate‚Äù. So, I went up to the attendant and told them the pass said I needed to check in with them and that I had moved our seats using the app. She prints off boarding passes for us and instead of them being he seats I chose, they are all the way at the back of the plane and we are no longer next to one another. I explained to her the seats I had chosen and asked if we could have those, but she said those seats were already taken. If you‚Äôre going to make an app, all aspects of the app should function. To show the seats I chose were available and then to find out they actually aren‚Äôt and we got moved to the very last row of the plane is very disappointing and frustrating.	negative
954	1438670520	travel	1	Here is the reason why I gave them one star .i was going to book a flight through their app but I received an email telling me that something went wrong and I have to call them .so I went ahead and called the phone number in the email I received it so,after 15 min in hold someone answer me he was nice and tell me they the booking didn‚Äôt win true because the card declined don‚Äôt know why I always use this card for all my purchases but it‚Äôs ok .then he told me he can book me by phone and almost after over 40 min he hang the phone and cursing me because he couldn‚Äôt finish which I told him it‚Äôs ok my concern was just to make sure my card will not charge .then thanked him and told him I can go  ahead and book it my self again online that will be easy but he insisted to do it by the phone which the price was more higher than online ,so please everyone read this review don‚Äôt waste your time and money with this company specially if you are immigrants,thanks	positive
955	1438670520	travel	1	"It‚Äôs bad enough to have to fly with Spirit and deal with the zero-notice 3-hour delays, tiny seats, no wifi or outlets, the constant up charges for things like traveling with more than just a purse/backpack, choosing your seat, or getting a mid-flight beverage. To make things worse for their customers, they‚Äôre also subjecting us all to their heinous mobile app that logs you out randomly, crashes unexpectedly, and‚Äîwhen everything else is going fine‚Äîjust isn‚Äôt able to communicate with Spirit to pull up flight information or check you in to retrieve boarding passes. I had (literally) 3 minutes of success with the app and was able to get boarding passes for my group‚Äôs first flight; immediately afterwards the app become nothing more than a waste of space on my phone.

Called them and held on almost 1 hour 40 minutes and finally someone came in.  Suggested i join their $9 club and go directly to the airport to have them book it.  Got there 3 hours prior and was told they could not help me.  I told them about holding on for so long and told to join the club.  They apologized and said ‚Äúwe hear this all the time‚Äù. Offered to file a complaint but they did nothing.  Bought a real ticket from a legit airline and got there.  Since then tried to see what my $9 club gets me.  NOTHING.   Sign in and there is no options to use it ANYWHERE.  No instructions or help unless you want to wait an hour or more to speak to someone.  Go Frontier if you want a discount airline.

958	1438670520	travel	1	I‚Äôve never wrote a review for a bad app but I had to do it this time. I don‚Äôt understand how a national company this big that flies people all over the country can‚Äôt afford to hire a real development team. This app has countless bugs. I am an IT admin so I deal with electronics everyday but I can‚Äôt get the app to finish the check in process. If I relaunch the app multiple times I will get a different upgrade price for the same seat. Then in the total price summary the seats will be yet again a different price. When you get the pay button, it shows a different price from the total above. Once you just bite the bullet and pay what it decided randomly then an error will come up saying to contact agent for full check in- not paid in full. I would love to pay so I don‚Äôt have to deal with it at the airport but no, not in this app. I will not fly this airline until I hear that the basic functionality issues are resolved. Going back to United.	positive
959	1438670520	travel	1	While on vacation in Austin, we used this app to purchase our bags and check in for our upcoming flight. An error message appeared on the app, indicating our baggage payment hadn‚Äôt processed, so we tried it again several more times only for it to suddenly inform us that it had been working the entire time and we had purchased 10 bags instead of 2 and charging us $450 instead of $90. This left us with $17 in our bank account while traveling abroad. After 2 hours on the phone between Spirit and the bank, we were informed that due to the way they process transactions, our money would be returned to us in 5-7 business days. To add insult to injury, I had to fight with a customer service rep to even have our bags compensated for the idiotic mishandling. I‚Äôm beyond disappointed with this experience. I‚Äôve flown budget carriers around the world, but this is by far the most pathetic excuse for an airline I‚Äôve ever seen.	negative
960	1438670520	travel	1	I‚Äôve never written a review for an app before. I‚Äôve never felt strongly enough. However there‚Äôs a first time for everything! This app is a waste of space. None of the functionality ever works. I end up using the website and even there only about half the functionality works. I‚Äôm all about a bargain airline but not having a functioning app is next level. Why even have an app if it doesn‚Äôt work? Just get rid of it. You make everyone print their boarding passes anyway and the check flight status doesn‚Äôt work and I can‚Äôt look up my trips so really, just fire the developers in charge and instead allocate that money to try and improve efficiency so when I‚Äôm checking how delayed my flight is (on safari because I can‚Äôt in the app) maybe it‚Äôll only be delayed a little bit because let‚Äôs be realistic it‚Äôll always be delayed - it‚Äôs just a matter of by how much.	negative
961	1438670520	travel	1	I read the reviews before installing the app, so I knew that it was not going to be pretty.  But I prefer using a digital boarding pass on my phone instead of having to print a paper copy and trying to keep track of it, so I took a chance on the app. It is utter garbage! I couldn‚Äôt even access any of the features because it would not allow me to sign in. My last name is St. Pierre and I kept getting a ‚Äúvalidation error‚Äù for my surname. Obviously whoever created the app never considered that someone might have a surname that has punctuation or a space in it. I checked my confirmation email to see how Spirit had listed my last name (St Pierre) and tried that ... did not work. So I tried every other variation (no period/no space, period/space, all caps, no caps etc. etc.) and nothing worked! So I‚Äôve now deleted the app and will resort to paper boarding pass. Useless! Ugh!	negative
962	1438670520	travel	3	I‚Äôm trying my best to like Spirit Airlines, and I shouldn‚Äôt complain about the money they‚Äôve saved me. However, there are a few issues that rub me the wrong way that weren‚Äôt known prior to biting on their BOA credit card scam. #1, I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten the card and opted for a southwest airline card had I known they only fly to hubs when they feel like it ( in my case ft Myers fl), #2, the booking website could be the worst ever and #3, pack a lunch if you have to wait for your luggage. I realize the airline is no-frills, and going through growing pains, but I hope they remember to take care of the early passengers who jumped onboard if the succeed, it‚Äôs been a trying process. As a side note, I‚Äôve never had a negative experience with any employee interaction, kudos to them!	positive
963	1438670520	travel	1	"I saw that this app only had 1.8 stars but I thought, how bad could it be?Admittedly I did not read the reviews right away.  Simple concept and plenty of other airlines can do it, why can‚Äôt Spirit?
Boy was I wrong! This app is literally the worst app I have ever used. It crashes every time I attempt to use it. Our flight got canceled and I tried to use it to reschedule, view statuses, and check-in. I could do nothing on it. My husband finally called to reschedule. He had to wait for about a half hour just to reach someone. So frustrating when it could‚Äôve been all done in a good app in less than 10 minutes. I finally went on a computer to check in and add my baggage. I am unable to pull up my boarding pass and after reading the reviews don‚Äôt trust that it‚Äôll work at the airport either so will be printing them.  Hire a new development team Spirit!"	negative
964	1438670520	travel	4	Feel horrible for the people with such bad experiences! I haven‚Äôt had an issue (prob jinxing myself here) I pay a cheap price.. so not complaining about no free snack or drink on plane.. had a nice size rolling suitcase from Walmart - fit as my free personal bag with 5 days worth of stuff packed .. never really had an issue with taking off late or cancellation. Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky with spirit? It‚Äôs nice to have an option when you can‚Äôt necessarily afford the others, and really just want to be able to visit loved ones far away.  If I HAD to complain about something my son is 6‚Äô3‚Äù and has to sit sideways but they offer bigger seats. Just too pricey. He can sit sideways not a long flight lol	positive
965	1438670520	travel	1	"Holy crap, this crashes a lot. I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúcrashes sometimes‚Äù or ‚ÄúI have experienced 3 crashes today‚Äù, I mean it is literally unusable on iOS because it crashes all the time. Not sometimes. Not frequently. All the time.

Before you think, ‚Äúmaybe this dude is embellishing‚Äù the app has crashed twice. 

I want to call up boarding passes for my flight. I‚Äôm not going to call them up and screenshot them, I‚Äôm going to take the effort to boot the laptop, find the snipping tool, email myself, save the image to my photos, and use that screen cap.

I‚Äôm paying for baggage fees, I‚Äôm paying to keep my family in the same row, I‚Äôm paying to pay to do all these things. The a la cart from Spirit is still better than the pitchmen schlepping cologne from Ryanair. If the option presented itself, I would pay a fee for the app to work. There is no a la cart option to fix this thing, and it would be a wonderful opportunity for them to take my money.

What do I have to pay to make the free app work?? Wanna sell advertising? I‚Äôll buy something from Dollar Shave Club. I‚Äôll sit through the next Clash of Clans reboot. For the love of all things holy, please promise the mechanics are far superior to the IT team."	positive
966	1438670520	travel	2	This app generally accomplishes what it says it will do- I have experienced it crashing, not working, loading for a long time, etc though. My bigger concern is that this has to be the worst airline app on the market. It‚Äôs a smaller ULCC, but even frontier‚Äôs app is miles ahead of this one. Spirits app is quirky, slow, minimalistic, and difficult to use. For example, you can‚Äôt add bags round trip- you have to do it for each way. There‚Äôs no way to check your miles status, or integrate it with Free Spirit. Overall this app works to do what it needs but really is in need of significant improvements, additions, and upgrades for an airline that serves so many passengers and is expanding so quickly. Spirit needs to invest a little more in their technology to keep up with the competition.	positive
967	1438670520	travel	4	I didn‚Äôt have any issues with the app. I was able to check in day before just like the email said. I already picked my  seats and checked my bag in. And the app saved my place even when it said I was timed out. If you‚Äôre not tech illiterate you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems. I‚Äôve also been able to find new flights back home easily. I guess one thing I can point out is that when I did search for a flight the app showed none then upon searching again I found some. That could have something to do with the time out. If you‚Äôre considering this app for flight just try it, wasn‚Äôt bad for me ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	positive
968	1438670520	travel	1	The app needs a serious overhaul!! Whatever a customer sees in the app should be honored. It isn‚Äôt the customers fault that Spirit cannot manage their app properly. Customer information should always follow a booking. I have to add my KTN on every ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù. I never had to complete this before. Most of the crew members in the Houston location are not very friendly and/or put effort into helping assist customer issues. As far as in-flight crews, only had 1 bad experience but most have been a pleasure to fly with. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô6‚Äù... it‚Äôs hard to sit in a normal seat. Offering an open seat that extends more leg room is in my opinion is as much needed as someone that needs assistance on and off the plane and through the terminal. I love Spirit. I don‚Äôt need all the bells and whistles. I need inexpensive flights that fly out when I need...... Spirit currently meets that.	positive

Got a one way flight three months in advance then last minute they changed the flight to a 4STOP FLIGHT last minute. Had to cancel through text only. The flight back was on time until we got to the airport. Flight attendant told us they didn‚Äôt know what was going on- the app didn‚Äôt either/never got an email notice- and just said that once we were boarded they would know? Sat in the plane for 3 hrs without notice. Once again, seems like their portfolio to not know or care what they tell you. You have to give your first born child to even get a discount or refund.

Take any other Airline."	negative
970	1438670520	travel	1	Using my name and confirmation number it was able to find my flight, but for some reason found two identical flights. I picked one of them and tried to pay for a carry on bag. After entering in my credit card info, I was taken to the hazardous materials screen, but when I clicked the button I got a pop-up saying I hadn‚Äôt paid in full. When I cancelled and reloaded the app, there was now only one flight found not 2. It somehow remembered that I wanted a carry-on, but still wouldn‚Äôt give me a boarding pass. Went to the website in a web browser and tried to do it there. It told me to call customer service to check in. Got bounced around various menus and finally thought I had found the right one about help with check in but the recorded voice just said ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù and hung up on me.	positive

Tried multiple hotspots, cellular data, same issue. The spirit website suffers from the same issues but it is just slightly more functional. Extremely long loading times, constant errors, nothing really working but rare times you can get it to somehow load and do what you want unlike this app.

I can‚Äôt believe a major airline could have such terrible servers, website, and mobile app that don‚Äôt function. It‚Äôs mind boggling that this app was released and it seems Spirit isn‚Äôt doing anything to improve their terrible website/servers/ or this app. The developers should be ashamed."	negative
972	1438670520	travel	1	You should be ashamed at your development team for putting this piece of crap on the App Store. It‚Äôs better than the old app but I cannot look at my current flight without the app crashing, check-in does not work on this app either I had to do it online. I requested a boarding pass via email and never got it. There‚Äôs also nowhere I‚Äôve found to use your spirit profile number for rewards. Even your websites give me constant errors whenever I try to check in or get my boarding pass. For a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù company this is unacceptable. Get your development team to fix many of these things or get a new development team. I guess the impossible use of your app or your website go along perfectly with your ‚Äúbare fare‚Äù model. Enjoy the zero stars.	positive
973	1438670520	travel	2	Both mine and my wife‚Äôs apps crash whenever we click on one of our trips. How do they expect you to check in through electronic means if they don‚Äôt provide proper tools?  Customer service was no help. Just kept reading from their scripts. We are pretty committed to this airline, but come on, fix your tool. We cannot always print when traveling. Should not have to use work arounds. They suggest using online check in and they will email the boarding pass. Should not have to. Using that method you can‚Äôt save the boarding pass to your wallet.  We are happy to check in electronically, but if your app is not working at all, then scrap it and start over with better technology.	positive
974	1438670520	travel	5	I have taken four flights on Spirit in the last few months and this app has helped me have a smooth trip the last three trips.  I didn‚Äôt know about the boarding pass display until my second trip.  A friendly Spirit airlines agent very helpfully showed me how to pull up the pass at the boarding gate and it has worked well on the two trips I‚Äôve taken after that.  I book my flights on my computer and this app takes over after I got the confirmation email.	positive
975	1438670520	travel	1	This app is horrible and shouldn‚Äôt even bother existing. I couldn‚Äôt check in on the app. I couldn‚Äôt buy a checked bag. It says in the app description that it notifies you when it‚Äôs time to check in. That‚Äôs a lie. I have notifications enabled and received no such notice. The app doesn‚Äôt update you with gate information or changes, when your flight is boarding, nothing! My trip would randomly disappear from the app and reappear later only to disappear again. I spent an hour and a half on the phone (after navigating their automated phone tree hell, no doubt trying to avoid actually letting you to talk to a person even though the app stated I need to contact an agent) trying to resolve the repeated and various error messages I kept getting in the app.	negative

They state my boarding pass will be emailed to me for free after check in via their website. If it isn‚Äôt sent, you have to pay per pass to print at airport.

I checked in a bag and when I submitted the payment it gave a Java error. OK. I reopened the app and tried again - same. Finally it went through a third time. But I see 3 charges on my Credit Card. Had to call the Customer Service, still waiting for the charges to be reversed.

It‚Äôs the same while checking in or seat selections. It just crashes at every turn. How this app passed any quality checks, and why apple allows payment processing through this app is a mystery. 

What makes it worse is their website - more of the same problems."	negative
978	1438670520	travel	1	Honestly, every other airline has managed to deliver an app that enables you to check in for your flight and deliver an electronic boarding pass. This one keeps crashing. Can‚Äôt check in, can‚Äôt get a boarding pass and when I tried to check in for my return flight, I could not find my reservation. After sitting on hold for 20 minutes, the agent said that since I was a no-show for my initial flight, they canceled the return. How do you not have a record of MY BOARDING PASS and the fact that I checked in and actually flew on your airline 4 days ago???  Does not fill me with confidence about the competency of your operations. I‚Äôm filling a complaint with the FAA. Do not expect Spirit to be in business much longer.	positive
979	1438670520	travel	5	"I don‚Äôt know why people hate on Spirit. Mostly is people who got extra charged because of not reading specifications (own fault).  

Spirit is a growing coming, they already started upgrading their planes and the app as well. I can see critical information, make changes and more thru the app. I love it. 

Instead go hate on American Airlane, a company rated on the top 10 worst airline companies. (Spirit is not even in there due to the amount of companies but if AA made it there... is for a reason)."	negative
980	1438670520	travel	1	"I went to check in on my flight 24 hours in advance. I clicked to check in on the app, and the screen hung up my name and reservation number. First it wouldn't accept my reservation number, then the second time I entered the number, the app apparently accepted the number (no reject message) but wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere. 

I went to a different check-in button to try to work around it. It posted a flight on top - but the wrong flight, and no other info. I went to continue anyhow, but it said I need to select as passenger - on a blank screen - no options. Another dead end. If you want to push this app so hard, you better make sure it works. The most basic functions were broken."	negative

I found this new one, and was blown away!  First of all it integrates with Roboform, which I love.  Secondly, it‚Äôs got the bells and whistles the old one frustratingly didn‚Äôt have.

982	1438670520	travel	1	If I could give this app half a star I would. I have had a great experience with Spirit Airlines up to this point, but this app just cost me $200. My girlfriend and I checked in for the flight on the app and the app sent the boarding pass to my iPhone‚Äôs wallet and to my Apple Watch. After walking through security to my flight, the Spirit employees at the Detroit airport instructed us that these boarding passes were not as she put it, ‚Äúreal‚Äù. She said sometimes the app sends the wrong tickets. She made us go back to the spirit kiosk and recheck in. By the time we did this, we missed our flight and were forced to spend $99 a person to get new seats on a different flight all because of an app. Never trust this app.	negative
983	1438670520	travel	1	98% of the time this app is garbage and crap.  Like actual garbage, this app needs to be thrown into a dumpster and hauled away.  And like actual crap, the developers don‚Äôt clean it up, they just let the crap dry up and blow away in the wind.  Whoever approved this piece of software for public use needs to not only be out of a job, but this person needs extensive psychiatric therapy with the use of heavy medication, and maybe even twice or three time-a-day electroshock therapy.  To quote the great scholar, Vanilla Ice, this app needs to put on ‚ÄúIce, Ice baby.‚Äù And what I mean is freeze development, go to a local elementary school, and find a child who could do a better job creating this app instead of the huge, Mount Everest sized steaming pile of feces that it currently is.	positive
984	1438670520	travel	1	If I could give this airline and their app no stars I would. From the start of booking my flights, everything has been a true nightmare. I‚Äôve been nickel and dimed for everything to where I could‚Äôve book two other roundtrip tickets with another airline and had no issues! Their customer service is horrible, their fees are ridiculous and rebooking is a joke if your flight gets cancelled. This app always continuously crashes and checking in on the website is impossible because it‚Äôs always ‚Äúover flowing with traffic‚Äù. I highly recommend to everyone to never ever fly spirit. I definitely will never be doing so again myself. This airline should be shutdown.	negative
985	1438670520	travel	1	"This very well could be the worst app on the Apple store. I believe that I could develop a better app in an hour than the team who put this flaming pile of garbage together. There are constant errors when trying to conduct simple tasks. Checking into a flight and getting a boarding pass is like pulling teeth as the application either crashes or errors out upon conducting the activity. 

I just don‚Äôt understand how such a large company cannot take some notes from other airlines in regard to their applications. Apps are supposed to relieve frustration and create convenience for flyers. This app does quite the opposite and creates more work for the end user. 

Poor excuse for an application."	negative
986	1438670520	travel	1	"Soooo... the idea of this app is to make things seamless... well that‚Äôs a problem when you show up to the airport and CANT PULL UP YOUR BOARDING PASS...

Well even before that... it‚Äôs suggested to check in on your phone  Becca use it saves money, but I‚Äôm unable to check in. The app takes forever to load, won‚Äôt allow you to log in, gives inaccurate info, and doesn‚Äôt update flight info in a timely manner

Spirit should TRULY be ashamed.... this is one of the most unreliable apps I‚Äôve used in my life. I wish I could give ZERO stars because pulling up flight info is kind of... well ABSOLUTELY important, not everyone has access to a printer, and you‚Äôre saying you have a solution."	positive
987	1438670520	travel	5	"Few years ago bumpy start but hit their stride.  LOVE the schedules, people and prices.  Southwest is now a joke, pricing like everyone else.  Bin reclining seats brilliant.  The debates about your seat reclining like 10 degrees which is irrelevant is silliness on other airlines.

Being low cost airline customers can be difficult on bag policies when they are in the wrong but Spirit shows great patience.  People, if you save $300 on a flight don‚Äôt gripe about $25 for a carryon.  $9 fare club is awesome too."	positive
988	1438670520	travel	1	This app is horrible. It does not work when you try to check in, it doesn‚Äôt confirm all the way. You have to restart it 10+ times for it to work. It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard. If they are going to make the app the only resource to get a free boarding pass, they should make it easily assessable. But of course because it‚Äôs for free, it‚Äôs complete garbage. I unfortunately had to take spirit as it was the only option for a last minute work trip. I had previous negative experiences with spirit, not through the app. And now with this bad experience with the app, I will make extra efforts to avoid any Spirit airline services moving forward.	negative
989	1438670520	travel	5	On Feb 20, 2020, I was on a flight 425 (Denver to ORD) with the most amazing flight attendant. I could only see her first name, Sivie, on her name tag. There was a customer sitting in 3c who was being very rude, loud and disruptive. With tact and professionalism, Sivie addressed the rude customer and he finally complied. It was amazing to watch because the customer kept trying to push the flight attendants button and she refused to take the bait. The flight was non-eventful the rest of the way.	negative
990	1438670520	travel	1	This app has been very frustrating to use. I tried to update a few of my reservations and it doesn‚Äôt update. I cancelled a flight over one month ago and it is still showing in my trips. When I log in for the first time, I get a message that I timed outü§®.  Also, the trips that show are only halfway showing and can‚Äôt be read. I contacted Customer Service about several issues with the app and changes in my reservation and nothing has changed. Because it‚Äôs hard to beat their fare prices, I will continue to fly Spirit but they need to make some serious improvements in their mobile app.	neutral

I love that you finally have an APP, it‚Äôs been a long time request for so many people. So far I like the APP, basic but works good. Only suggestion it‚Äôs to please if you could add eventually the same stby list you could see on your website in the manage reservation into the APP. Right now if you flight stby and want to see if flight it‚Äôs full you have to log into into the normal website, if you could add the option to see the stby list direct from the APP will be great. For the rest good job updating this application."	positive
992	1438670520	travel	5	"After reading all the low stars review, and a 5-star review wrote 9 hours ahead. I decided to download because the app was updated 1 day ahead of my downloading day.

993	1438670520	travel	1	If you‚Äôd like to spend minutes of your precious life wasted to no avail on an app that provides you no ability to manage your flights, resulting in a level of aggravation that is hard to match- this is the app for you!! I cannot check in, cannot select a seat, cannot enter my frequent flyer number (that is already saved in the app!). Terribly disappointing that your IT team cannot create a better platform than this. All of this after I was erroneously charged $70 a month ago before I even booked a flight. Makes me concerned what other corners your company may be cutting and question if I will ever fly Spirit again.	negative
994	1438670520	travel	2	Every time I want to check in or want to see my tickets it looks like it‚Äôs going to open but it crashes and it takes me back to just the front menu, so when I need to check in I have to do it in a computer.

Another thing I noticed is that as a $9 member I don‚Äôt see the deals or it doesn‚Äôt give me the same deals as someone who is not a member üëé Please fix the bug on the appüôèüèΩ it sure would be nice to have my ticket on my phone app.	positive
995	1438670520	travel	1	If you manage to use either to check in, but bags, or choose seats and it processes, DO NOT MAKE CHANGES. You will have to call because it will mess everything up so bad AND while on the phone, seats showing available to you via the app will not be the same as the person on the phone. The flight experience isn‚Äôt as bad as everyone makes it out to be, but the IT issues are such a deterrent that I won‚Äôt be flying them again because you have to question the capabilities of an airline that can‚Äôt produce a working website or app that an 11yo these days could create.	negative
996	1438670520	travel	3	I usually have to always go to the website to check in or get my boarding pass.

998	1438670520	travel	5	"My take on spirit is calibrate expectations. This is a low cost airline and they frankly excel at being one. Every single extra has a price tag. On the other hand you don‚Äôt have to (implicitly) pay for stuff you don‚Äôt need.

1000	926252661	utility	5	"I am giving 5 stars because both my flood light cam and spot light cam work perfectly. No delay, sharp clear video, I can hear and speak through the device very well. I am 100% thrilled with these cameras at almost a year after installing them. They were easy to install. I am a 60 yr. old widow and it was easy to wire in the flood light cam. My spot light cam is the one that plugs into a outlet. I wonder if these work so much better than my Ring doorbell because my door bell is battery operated. I keep the doorbell charged up, and have the Ring extender chime, but the delay on the doorbell is frustrating. By the time the live feed kicks in the people who ring the bell are walking away. I imagine it is because it is battery operated. I wonder if the direct wired models are faster. This camera has  caught someone up by my bay windows trying to decide what to do once he noticed it was a Ring doorbell and I was able to have my local police view the video with ease and a better description than I could see in the dark.
I wish Ring could discount their products for us older folks on a fixed income. I would love to get more camera or the security system, but I just can‚Äôt afford them. What I do have makes me feel safer than if I didn‚Äôt have them. Oh! The neighborhood part of the app. Is the best thing ever! Sharing info with the neighbors also makes me feel safer."	positive

Same problem many other of your other customers complain about. I wish you would at least have the option of turning off the 10 minute timer that shuts down live view. Should be the customers decision to drain the battery in live view.  That‚Äôs why I bought an extra battery. Also, one of the times I tried calling you I was given the option of making an appointment for you to call me back but you never did. And Kaitlyn@Ring, don‚Äôt bother to paste your typical reply telling me to email you because you‚Äôre so concerned. I‚Äôve read your response back to other customers so many times that I‚Äôve memorized it. Customers should realize if you have to paste that same cookie cutter reply addressing everyone‚Äôs concern then Ring and your customers have a really big problem. I‚Äôm connected to my 2.4 GHz network and hitting roughly 8Mbps at -53 dBm power. Being an engineer I realize that the business unit and marketing/sales have more say than the technical staff at most companies. The technical people rarely want to release the product before it‚Äôs ready but the business side always makes that happen which is why your commercials on TV are so great but your product has a lot to be desired. And you Kaitlyn, I‚Äôm not sure which side of the house you‚Äôre on but I hope they‚Äôre paying you well.	positive

However, I cannot navigate any of the equipment without the voiceover on! Unless someone comes over and review it for me, I can‚Äôt answer my doorbell, or speak on any of them without the voiceover. I have spoken with several rang assist technicians and they keep telling me they‚Äôre going to develop a fix for my issue. It‚Äôs been almost 3 years now, and my struggles are still here and there have been no fixes! These devices were expensive. Can you please help me. I thought for me being a single disabled mother these devices would help me but, they only help me if someone comes and does everything for me. If I am home alone, I cannot speak or answer the doorbell. I still have to physically go to the door myself and try to figure out who it is or just yell and ask them! They should not happen when you spend this amount of money! Please develop a fix for blind people who want to use your devices with voiceover. Thank you	positive
1003	926252661	utility	1	We‚Äôve had our Ring Pro for over two years and have intermittently had an issue where it would stop working right after someone rang the doorbell and wouldn‚Äôt work again until it was unplugged and plugged back in. This issue has been prevalent since a few months after we purchased. Any time I called customer service they would just have me run a reset and say it was working again and that there was nothing else they could do for me. Well finally a customer service person was unexpectedly helpful and had me do all sorts of tests to check how much power it was getting and come to find out it gets enough power, but there‚Äôs some sort of ‚Äòfluke‚Äô issue some of the doorbells have that prevent them from being able to operate all the time when the in-house chime is also activated. And wouldn‚Äôt it happen to be that we finally figured the cause of this problem out a few months after the warranty period expired. They were gracious enough to offer a discount on purchasing a new one, but if I didn‚Äôt want to buy another possibly faulty doorbell I would need to deactivate my internal chime, and just keep checking my app to see when it stops working so I can go home and perform another reset. I just got done with another reset because I realized today that my doorbell hasn‚Äôt worked for over a week. I would definitely not recommend this doorbell to anyone, and I will be searching for a replacement as soon as I finish posting this review.	positive
1004	926252661	utility	3	"I thought this ring product would help with seeing who‚Äôs coming in my property to deliver, guest coming over etc... Oh yes, I can see partially who after the fact. What‚Äôs the point in having live viewing after a package has been delivered, guest after they walk away etc... This now seems like a ploy to get people‚Äôs hard earned money for an iffy product. 
More developer work needs attention to the quality and functionality of the doorbell etc... Half the time the video will show dark or washed out when it starts playing then get clear a few seconds later and not revealing anything worth seeing. You make the commercials look great and inviting but in real life, it‚Äôs not as clear and real time as falsely advertised. 
I will no longer encourage ANYONE to get these products until you all fix or come out with better quality products and fix the app. This review is for any and everyone considering Ring and that has Ring who‚Äôs experiencing multiple issues. By the way, I have read the instructions on how to use and maintain the app, spoke with Ring support, did troubleshooting steps and had the unit replaced. This and the replacement Ring  was professionally installed. 
Please attend to these issues if you expect to keep and remain getting new customers. In the meantime I‚Äôll have to spend extra money on another product to see if it‚Äôll do a better job. SMH"	positive
1005	926252661	utility	1	Ring technical support has done nothing but make excuses for the past month. They refuse to refund my money for the monthly service they can‚Äôt supply. Refused to refund for the doorbells I purchased .they are not usable on their app Any longer . It reads the locations will not load. Bottom line they blocked me out of my account. But they continue to claim that it‚Äôs a bug in their system. I have spoken with several of their customer service reps. Each one has a different story and different line of BS. Appears they read off a 3 x 5 cards and have no clue what they‚Äôre really doing. Although based in the United States I still feel service is no better than what I get if you were calling overseas. My last two phone calls requesting supervisors were left on hold for over two hours. No one ever came on. Eventually I hung up . Very bad customer service. My first ring was original before they change their name. My current one is less than eight months old . The old one and new ones are still in service. We cannot access the system through any of the phones we own ,computers or iPads.  With the lack of knowledge customer support has about their product in their inability to fix the problems. I would think very hard before purchasing any of their equipment. Also as a follow-up I am still waiting for return call for the last five days. Never came!!	negative

The system is easy to setup and additional sensors are available at a descent price. I especially like the tie in of the Z-wave Co2 and smoke sensors.  
The only issue I had was locating a place for the module so the cellular function would have connection (not sure what network ring connects to, I have several cell towers within two blocks that apparently don‚Äôt cover ring).  I only get one to two bars at best. 
My other issue is the keypad. I mounted the keypad in a place convenient and was able to plug it in permanently through a plug on the opposite side of the wall in a closet. After a week the keypad locked up and I learned from ring that the keypad can‚Äôt stay plugged in. In my eyes that's a poor design. I understand what the thinking behind it is, being portable. Ring please upgrade so customers can leave the keypad plugged in so it won‚Äôt lock up. 
Both my issues can be worked around and the system works nice. 
Overall I would rate the ring five stars for setup and general use, just wish the annoying keypad issue could be upgraded along with better cellular connection."	positive

Ring sent me a new ring doorbell as well as a chime extender. Very nice of them. However, now when my videos record, it‚Äôs just a black screen 2 out of 3 recordings. The videos that do actually record, some of them are basically just a frozen screen shot but no video. So I‚Äôm paying to keep these videos, that do me absolutely no good. I‚Äôve been troubleshooting with an Ashlei O. But can‚Äôt figure it out. I‚Äôve done everything she asked. I‚Äôve sent her 6 emails since her email telling me what to try. She just won‚Äôt respond to me. It‚Äôs now been a week since I‚Äôve heard from any one that can possibly help me. Not sure if they sent me a refurbished ring which is why it‚Äôs having issues. My internet connection is great. My router is in a good place. I have no idea. But a few of my clients that have come to my home this last week have asked about my ring doorbell. I‚Äôll continue to tell them to stay far away until someone actually calls or emails me to figure out the broken replacement ring doorbell that they sent me. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm doing something wrong or if I have a defective ring doorbell. It will only occasionally alert me when someone comes to my front door. I had a group of kids, on my porch, leaving a derogatory comment spelled out in rocks, and it didn‚Äôt record them at all. I would‚Äôve loved to see who that was. But it‚Äôll record a car driving by on the street in front of me. Not really worth the money."	negative
1008	926252661	utility	5	I have many ring products that all tie together seamlessly into this app. The video doorbell, new spotlight cam, stick up cam, and the brand new security system. My family, pets and I feel safe away on trips and feel like we have a great prevention from break ins. With the low cost of the video storage for all of our video devices I am always aware of what goes on in or around my house at all times. I feel secure and never have any issues setting up, connecting or using their devices. They all integrate wonderfully and I could not be happier. I have recommended to many friends and family members to get just a ring video doorbell. As a new mom with dogs it was hard when anytime someone rang, packages, whatever, our dogs would wake our baby. Now with Chime, I set a tone that doesn‚Äôt illicit barking and am aware when anyone is at the door or rings the doorbell. The motion detection is amazing and really easy to customize to not get everyone hat walks by, or you can if that‚Äôs what you want. Absolutely love this company and their products. Every time they come up with something new I‚Äôm pleased with how well thought out it is and how well it integrates.	positive
1009	926252661	utility	5	I love the concept of the product. The reviews about slow lag times are true. To make the cameras functional I have had to purchase two cameras per each location.  For example I have a RingPro doorbell and a second camera facing 90 degrees off the other camera. One of the two cameras gets the intruder. I have the same set up for the driveway; two cameras at different locations. The cameras caught some fellow around 2 in the morning walking up into the driveway and trying the door handles of the locked cars. The RingPro extenders don‚Äôt have enough range. I have had to purchase a more powerful extender to get the speed and quality up on one of the cameras. The notification on the iPhone cannot be changed so the sound is like tinker bell. I have asked for a vibrate only notification but so far nothing. Bottom Line: don‚Äôt expect to purchase ONE camera and have everything work without problems. This product is still being developed. UPDATE: Ring keeps getting better...they have done away with the ‚Äútinkled bell‚Äù alert sound as the only alert sound and added voice alerts which are much better. Ring has also added a ‚Äúsnooze‚Äù function which will stop alerts up to 2 hours.	positive
1010	926252661	utility	3	I love the concept of the Ring device and instant notifications triggered by motion or a doorbell ring. Unfortunately, this falls short when timing is critical. To only see the back of someone because of the delay in activation defeats the purpose of the device. Now for the recent update. I updated the app, as prompted, to ensure the best results  for my security device. BIG MISTAKE!! All of my recordings were deleted! When I tried view even the most recent motion activation, I was able to receive the notification, but I had a message stating my plan was expired attached to every single notification (Motion, Live View and Doorbell). I spent an hour on the phone with customer service as my plan was not expired. The rep couldn‚Äôt explain what happened. On a whim, I deleted the app and reinstalled it, and tadah,  everything came back. Ring People: if you are reading this, please correct whatever went wrong!!! I didn‚Äôt even know that my videos were deleted or that newer stuff was not being recorded until I went into the videos to delete the ones I didn‚Äôt want. This is potentially dangerous when homeowners think they are protected by surveillance and that surveillance fails from a flaw in the app without even knowing it until it is too late. Hopefully everything doesn‚Äôt get screwy again as I only discovered the issue today.	negative
1011	926252661	utility	1	My husband and I have the Wireless Spotlight cameras. One on our front door for package thieves and one on our garage to watch over my car because we only have one garage. While the cameras come in handy in us keeping an eye on our packages while we aren't home, they're really good for nothing. They're inconveniently dysfunctional. The motion detector really isn't that great. There has been two incidents right in front of our driveway and the cameras caught nothing. One of our guest's car got broken into. When we looked back at the videos, it recorded cars driving by and all, but nothing of what happened. The front door camera captured a small glimpse of someone already walking right off so we have no idea if it was that person or not. So helpful, right? The other time, someone threw a glass bottle at our guest's car. Once again, nothing. I noticed that if there's continuous movement, the camera records the first 30 seconds and that's it. Basically, all it'll catch is someone walking up to your house and what they do is history. This makes Ring not a reliable security system at all. My biggest problem with the cameras is, sometimes the live video won't even load! And NO, it's not because of our wifi. We plan on getting rid of Ring for a security system that records 24 hours instead. If you are looking for some pros or special features of Ring cameras, that can be found on the product description.	negative
1012	926252661	utility	4	"Use the power of amazons AWS to tag possible motion that sets off my cameras. Simply place a blue or red box around the item triggering the camera detection. Take a still of the video with the item triggering my motion detector and send that image as a notification on my iPhone. That way I can chose to open the app and view the video or see that it was my wife pulling into the driveway. 

It takes too long for me to move from the notification to the video, even on high speed WiFi with my iPhone XS Max. By the time I view the live video, the item setting off my motion detector may no longer be in frame. Then, I have to wait for the motion history to load the video to your servers in order to view. I spend a minute refreshing the list, all the while the item setting off my motion detector has moved to a new location. 

I love the cameras and the system overall, but the time delay from notification to viewing my camera feed is too slow and cumbersome. This eventually causes me to pass on viewing some motions. If it happens to me, then I know it happens to others. One day my lack of motivation is going to cause harm and render your services null, the whole reason I‚Äôve paid for cameras and video storage in the first place."	negative
1013	926252661	utility	2	"We like that we get the chimes straight to our phones and we can talk to people through the chimes. Motion is great. Live view only worked once for us and it was bad quality and kind of annoying that we can talk and see people clearly when the ring communicates to the phone but not when the phone communicates to the ring. Night vision is very over exposed. Faces are not recognizable. Sometimes motion activation is very late. Not all the time but that takes things down a notch on the trust factor. Battery also died after a week after charging. Thought it would be at least a couple months before we had to recharge. Might have to find a better option as we don‚Äôt have a doorbell wire so we have to rely on battery power. We‚Äôll use it for a while before we make our decision but as of right now we‚Äôre just kind of happy with what we got.

Btw the chat bot for troubleshooting is very slow. Found articles online faster than it gave me answers. Waited 5 min for it to reply. Actually had to send a message to wake it up.

Update: trying to setup ‚Äúspotlight cam battery‚Äù but because of the live view issue above. Don‚Äôt know what it is but motion is working but live view can‚Äôt? Is there anyone from ring that can help? Assistance is lacking, main feature of device doesn‚Äôt work. Rating drop and almost ready to send back."	positive
1014	926252661	utility	4	"Either something happened with the new update or idk what.  I‚Äôve been using my two spotlight cams for 9 months now. The doorbell for 20 months.   I have a Wasserstein solar panel hooked up to one spotlight cam. The battery stopped charging two weeks ago. That‚Äôs another story. I haven‚Äôt used these cameras in the cold yet. We had a few  cold nights in the teens.  I thought maybe it was the cold so I brought them all inside, charged batteries for over 12 hours.  Even tho the website says operating temp is like 4¬∞. But that‚Äôs the operating temp or the DEVICE. I‚Äôm wondering what the operating temp of the BATTERIES are. 
Installed everything again.  Solar panel still not charging battery. (I‚Äôll deal with Wasserstein later). 
In all three products  the video is choppy and pixelating and slow. I cannot touch the screen to dismiss the onscreen controls. Nothing has changed in my WiFi settings. The router is in the same spot it‚Äôs been for four years. This seems to have started after the recent update. 
I have 4 stars because while they do what I mostly want there is a LOT of room for improvement.  If I could install a real security system I would but I rent and can‚Äôt be drilling holes into the house or the walls or floors for wires.  
Please check into this."	positive
1015	926252661	utility	3	I own both a ring doorbell and a ring floodlight cam. Overall I am pleased with both. The cameras are excellent, day and night. The motion sensing is almost perfect (but occasionally does miss activity). Notifications are almost immediate (most of the time). I purchased the Floodlight cam to replace a motion sensing fixture that had a photocell for dusk to dawn operation year round at 50% intensity until it detected motion, then 100% intensity until no longer detecting motion. This was a great product that worked well. The ring floodlight cam was advertised to have a dusk to dawn feature but all I can find is to set specific on/off times, even though dusk and dawn change throughout the year. I have yet to find a way to program the lights to come on at dusk and off at dawn regardless of time of year. FAQ said that although dimmability was not available yet it would be offered in a later update. When I purchased the floodlight cam I was promised by the ring rep that it would be an available feature soon. I‚Äôm still waiting for the dimmer feature. I‚Äôve tried to leave the lights on all night but my neighbors say it is too bright and shines in their windows. Please update the app with both the dawn to dusk feature and the dimmer feature as promised. Then I will be pleased to give 5 stars.	positive
1016	926252661	utility	1	"I bought the ring doorbell and it worked good for about 5 months then problems. They switched out my doorbell but the app won't allow me to delete videos from the old doorbell. When I try to delete them it asks me to login again. I was told the next app update would fix this but there have been a couple since then without a fix. 
     Also the company can see your battery status even if your doorbell is hard wired but you can only see battery status if it's not hard wired. Again I was told this feature was inadvertently removed and would be added back in the next update. No such luck so far. App needs some work in my opinion. There are better doorbells out there and when this one dies I will switch.
          The neighborhood feature places me in a city I have never lived at.  I have talked to tech support and they know it‚Äôs an issue but two more updates later and still it isn‚Äôt fixed. 
         Last is the doorbell ‚Äúshows motion alert‚Äù at 3:47 every morning. Once again I was told they know about this bug but several updates later and it still is alerting me in the middle of the night to ‚Äúmotion‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt exist. What does tech support say? They will ‚Äúeventually‚Äù fix it but in the mean time setup a time in the app that you don‚Äôt receive alerts. That defeats the purpose of having the door bell. So basically tech support hasn‚Äôt been any help at all."	positive
1017	926252661	utility	5	"I must say it is awesome knowing what is going on at home when your away. I gave this product only two stars initially because I have had numerous problems with it ever since I got it. I have had problems with WiFi connection, batteries and poor video quality or delayed play back when someone is either at the door or in my driveway. I contacted Ring support more than I can count and every time I did the same trouble shooting that never fixes the problems, you would be better off getting something that actually works, I am taking it down and replacing it with something that works. I may consider using Ring again when all the problems are fixed, until then better luck next time

Update: 
After speaking with Sam from Ring headquarters, she did everything she could to help me. Sam offered a full refund for the products and stayed in touch even after I received my refund. Because of Sam, I may consider using Ring Cameras in the future. Sam know how to treat a customer and she made sure I was satisfied. I am updating my review to 5 stars because of the service Sam provided me with. This is what I call customer service, Thanks Sam."	positive
1018	926252661	utility	1	"Ever since the latest update was released video has been delayed. A person walks up to my door, the frame freezes. The camera is no longer recording the entire thing. It's pretty much only taking a snap shot. A get a motion alert and nothing is there because the camera is constantly freezing. I paid the yearly fee for video not pictures or nothing at all. Ring Pro is absolutely useless and like having no security feature at all if not doing what it was intended to do. I'm also glad to see I'm not the only one having this problem so support can't say it's on your end.

Update: Almost a year later and this doorbell is still a disaster. It worked great for about three months and then the developers started rolling out updates and the thing hasn‚Äôt worked like it should since. I have been through four of these doorbells within a year. The last one just stopped working completely. I‚Äôm a software engineer for over 20 years and sometimes being on the phone with CS for over an hour can be insulting. The video stream is choppy and not consistent. I continue to get pixelated video and freezing. UPS rings the doorbell and the video shows the driver leaving in his truck. I just wish they would get these firmware updates right or allow clients to rollback. New hardware but the developers are constantly putting out new software updates that are obviously not ready."	negative
1019	926252661	utility	4	"I‚Äôve had my ring Video Doorbell installed almost 2 months.  It‚Äôs been great!  I live in a rural area and the only traffic I usually get are family members or deliveries.  I had a digital doorbell prior to ring and although ring was simple to install, I apparently didn‚Äôt install ring correctly (because the doorbell no longer works), but I also have ‚ÄúChime‚Äù and prefer Chime over the digital doorbell any day!  I also love seeing pictures/comments from the neighbors with ring (there seem to be a lot of us) - ring makes a great neighborhood watch.

I have two very small complaints (which is why I scored it a 4 and not a 5):  I thought with power the battery would last a long time without requiring a charge.  It lasted almost 2 months.  The bright side is that I was sent an email warning me about the battery requiring a charge and the battery took seconds to remove/replace to charge it.  My second complaint is that activation is supposed to be triggered by infrared activity and not motion, yet when it‚Äôs windy, ring goes off a lot.  I could have gnats or something flying by, but I never see anything in the video.

Overall - I love ring and think it‚Äôs a great product and am exploring other products in the ring family."	positive
1020	926252661	utility	4	Hi, I have a ring spotlight wired. After reading tons of reviews it seems that most issues are caused by battery powered cameras. I did find out after that even the wired isn‚Äôt truly wired and has a battery. Regardless, I get really good video quality, the motion works 95% of the time, and as long as you set your settings for motion to say second bar over from left I haven‚Äôt had any problems. Also don‚Äôt set motion zone to the road or every car is gonna trigger it and drain battery.  I would like to see an option for  video quality in playback for when I‚Äôm not on WiFi. It‚Äôs just about impossible for me to watch a video otherwise. Possibly could add scrollable timeline pictures so we don‚Äôt have to watch the video and save data. The new live view feature I do not like. Maybe I haven‚Äôt had a chance to use it much but old one is much less complicated. Should have had some helpful emoji descriptions or similar over new buttons to help people understand better. Also when live viewing from new video feature I get awful feedback noise which isn‚Äôt very discreet. I had a squawk from time to time before but now every time so yeah I turned that part off. Was super easy to install as well. Thanks	positive
1021	926252661	utility	2	"First let me say the app works well and is easy to set up. I like the neighborhood feature and the ease of integrating other Ring products. However, the app insists on being the most important thing going on. If you select banner notifications, they do not automatically disappear unless you do it manually. This becomes especially problematic when I am using my phone for directions and the banner blocks the next turn and how many miles until the next turn. If I‚Äôm driving and try to swipe up, oftentimes I accidentally tap the banner, which opens the app. Then I have to pick up my phone while driving and try to switch back to navigation before I miss my turn,and this happens all the time. I want banner notifications but not permanently. 

The other gripe I have is the audio notification. If you are talking on the phone and someone sets off the motion detector, it notifies you over your conversation and you miss everything that was just said. If someone God forbid rings the doorbell afterwards, you miss even more of the conversation. I‚Äôm in sales so it has hit me at a few crucial times. Me: ‚Äúso what kind of budget are we working with?‚Äù Customer: ‚Äúwell we really like what we see so we desigMOTION DETECTED AT YOUR FRONT DOOR and I think we will be able to commit to DING DONG will that work? 

Annoying. Fix it please."	positive
1022	926252661	utility	3	"I have both a spotlight cam and a doorbell cam. Both have issues picking up cars. Always the same box truck or fire truck, it‚Äôs consistent at least... the spot light cam has more customization in regards to the customizable area that you can set where it picks up motion. The doorbell cam is too simple and not customizable enough which is weird because naturally that‚Äôs where more vehicle movement will be.. the flood light cam was worth every penny even though I can only use on about 25% sensitive due to said issues, it still picks up everything I need. The doorbell cam I‚Äôve actually considered removing other then it offers one simple function, when someone rings I can talk to them. Other then that I‚Äôve turned it‚Äôs sensitivity all the way down on the doorbell, I don‚Äôt need to know every time a box truck or the mail man goes by. 

All in all the floodlight cam is worth the money! The doorbell would probably be worth it if you lived in a quit neighborhood will low traffic. I would also love if the loading time to get into the camera after it spots motion would speed up, sometimes it takes up to 30+ seconds before my view of the live footage is available. Add more functionality to doorbell cam, speed up connection times and I‚Äôd give 5 stars."	positive
1023	926252661	utility	3	"The app was doing fine until the last update. Something is wrong with the motion schedule part. I had to disable my schedules because the app was getting it all wrong. For instance if I had a motion schedule to disable motion alerts between 6am-12pm the motion alerts would stop before 6am. In fact they would probably never turn on if I didn‚Äôt delete all the schedules. So now I just manually turn motion on and off until there‚Äôs a fix. Everyone seems to be having problems since the latest update.
UPDATE: I got help from their support team. What I did and I believe it worked was delete the app. Reboot the phone and then installed the app again. So video alerts are working fine and since I got my RSSI to about-42 it works really good. 
Another update: ok I‚Äôve got the same problem again. The schedules seemed to work until a certain day. Like one other review said it seems that days are off. So if you schedule your device to not alert you on a certain day it will likely turn off the day before you had it scheduled. So until they fix this I will have to not use the scheduled alerts. If you have this problem you will need to delete the app. Restart your phone and reinstall the app. And don‚Äôt use the schedules."	positive
1024	926252661	utility	3	"I started with the flood light cam. I like it most of the time. The camera is good on the videos when you go back to view, but this is my issue. The live view is not great, in & out, stalls, video drags. Also, at night the alerts go off constantly on some evenings. When i view, there is absolutely nothing there. I have it on the least sensitivity (people only), yet still goes off all the time, especially when it rains.
Then I have the original video doorbell. I hate that thing. Battery is dead after a week with almost no use, but i could live with that if it worked properly. Works maybe 10% of the time. Most of the time I get a black screen on the videos. It is installed properly, Has good connection. Yet I‚Äôll get an alert and when I view the video, yep just a total black screen throughout the entire video.
Now let me end with saying there is nothing wrong my connectivity. I have very good speed (pay for the highest my cable company offers), and the app shows good connectivity. I wanted to get others for my side/back, but very hesitant. I also like that they now have the home security, but again very hesitant. The 3 starts is because the floodlight is not horrid, but if i was rating the doorbell, would be 1 star (negative if it allowed)"	positive
1025	926252661	utility	3	I‚Äôm mostly satisfied with the app but I use an iPad mounted on the wall as a central hub for security/home automation and would like to see a little more done to improve the iPad experience. The iPad is mounted horizontally and it shows the different cameras all in one line down the middle of the app with unused space on either side, it might be better if while in landscape mode on iPad it would show one camera view beside the other or at least take up more of the unused space on either side. I would like to be able to use the split screen feature with this app on iPad so I could have this open and any other home automation app. Finally, I would like the ability to have the app be open but not unsecured. What I mean by that is I would like to have this app open with the screen on so I can see the cameras but also be able to quickly arm/disarm using my PIN. I would like to leave this app open at all times on the screen but currently if I were to have an intruder and have the app open, they could just tap on the Disarm button and completely negate the security system altogether. I don‚Äôt think this change would be right for everyone so maybe just a toggle in the app for ‚Äúrequire PIN to Arm/Disarm‚Äù might work. Happy so far!	positive
1026	926252661	utility	2	I‚Äôve had ring doorbell for couple years now unit used to work as advertised after many updates that just is not good. After the last few updates I‚Äôve been having trouble motion alert by the time the app opens up the person‚Äôs already gone. The lag time to open live view is so long I could leave wash dishes feed the dogs Mow the lawn and it might be open by the time I get back. The cameras have recently started to only show in black and white even when it‚Äôs full daylight outside. I don‚Äôt know what happened but the developers have totally ruined this product for me and to charge you money to have the videos on their cloud storage is stupid might as well just buy a NVR. Anytime you contact customer support it‚Äôs always the same thing it‚Äôs something wrong with your network it‚Äôs something wrong with your router it‚Äôs something wireless interference in your area well needless to say that‚Äôs not true I have 100 meg Internet service it works flawlessly I have a top tier router all my other networking products work just fine and I‚Äôve done site surveys to prove that it‚Äôs not a congestion issue on the 2.4 GHz network I seriously hope they‚Äôll fix the app issues or whatever they done or these things are going in the trash can or letgo and be some else‚Äôs problem.	negative
1027	926252661	utility	4	When I first got Ring it was the best thing I‚Äôve ever bought.  It was perfect and amazing, and always worked.  Now, i think more users have overwhelmed the website, and the developers.  I‚Äôve spent hours on the phone with Ring support, who are very helpful, but the problems I‚Äôm having an not be fixed by phone support.  I‚Äôm getting forced logouts constantly, which is not good when you need to answer an alarm.  Then, recently, when I tried to exercise options during viewing, which you are supposed to be able to do, it started eliminating a whole series of videos, or freezing them.  These are glitches that need to be fixed by developers, but I‚Äôve been waiting a couple of months, already, and these issues still exist.  I think they need new, or more developers, and deal better with expansion of their client base. Very recently, another ‚Äúquirk‚Äù is now occurring: when I try to answer an event, Ring won‚Äôt let me see it; it‚Äôs just added to the dashboard. You can see it eventually, which obviously is not the point. I also want to say that, with all it‚Äôs faults, Ring does let me sleep better at night. And it is still an amazing creation.	positive
1028	926252661	utility	3	"When I first downloaded the app and saw it was at a 3/5 stars I was a bit surprised but now I know why so many people are complaining.

- Iv recently bought the Ring doorbell and I get notifications like crazy. Every couple of minutes or so I get notifications saying ‚ÄúThere is motion at your front door‚Äù I check and nothing is there. This happens several times throughout the day. In the past 3 days Iv gotten 70+ notifications saying there is motion when there is absolutely nothing. I check every single notification because now I can‚Äôt rely on Ring if there actually someone at my door or not.
- Second when there actually is someone at my door I don‚Äôt get notifications? Iv recently asked my aunt to take care of my dog while I am away. She comes in and out of the house several times a day and only once I got a notification saying there is someone at my door. When I received a notification it was after she went to check on my dog. I even had to ask her if that was her car in the driveway because like I said before it doesn‚Äôt give me notifications when she is actually there. What‚Äôs the point of paying hundreds of dollars to secure my home when it doesn‚Äôt work?"	positive
1029	926252661	utility	3	The app is very intuitive and works just the way I need it too (with the exception of some people posting things that aren‚Äôt a security concern [one person posted a video of it snowing in my city two years ago because it was pretty... Really?],). The only problem is when I go to look at either my floodlight camera or my doorbell camera from a notification that I get on my iPhone, it never works... the app never gets to showing the actual video of the camera in question. It stays on a loading screen with a blurred image of something recorded on the camera previously. When I press the red ‚Äúhang up‚Äù button (downwards facing phone symbol) and manually try to view the camera again, however, the camera works. This retry works 99.9% of the time. I don‚Äôt think it can be a coincidence. It now takes too long for me to view something potentially dangerous. I‚Äôm not sure if the problem is with the camera or the app, but because I can always view my camera the second time I try to open it, I‚Äôm going to blame the app. :-( So i can‚Äôt give this app more than a 3-star rating. Would definitely change this app rating to 5 stars if this were fixed, however!	negative
1030	926252661	utility	1	"I have owned one of Ring‚Äôs best product offerings in the ring video pro. The problem with Ring is 1.) they ALWAYS promise features and updates that never show up. For example, If you own an iOS device and keep falling for Ring‚Äôs baloney ‚Äúwe are working on HomeKit‚Äù story just keep in mind they‚Äôve literally been saying that for almost three years and they haven‚Äôt even been testing HomeKit in public beta yet so it‚Äôs not showing up anytime soon. 2.) The most important function of the camera is the ability to quickly access the video when there is motion or someone rings the doorbell. For some reason, whenever either of those events happens, the live video freezes up and won‚Äôt let you access it. I believe this is because the camera starts automatically recording (which is good), but it‚Äôs incapable of recording and letting you access the live feed at the same time. It‚Äôs extremely inconsistent. What is the point of this if you don‚Äôt get to see and talk to the person until two mins after the event? So bad. And it‚Äôs NOT my internet connection. I have several other far better WiFi cameras in that area of the home that works flawlessly and I have a 1,000mbps internet speed (regularly 300+ over WiFi).

The actual motion detection and doorbell feature don‚Äôt work half the time and go out with out warning. After being told by neighbors the doorbell wasn‚Äôt working, I called in to find out the doorbell had been offline for about a week and a half. Not very good security if it goes out and doesn‚Äôt tell you it‚Äôs out. I called in to fix the problem after getting stuck in an infinite loop of trying to reset the device. Turns out it‚Äôs a common problem ‚Äúthat the team is working on‚Äù. Thanks for the heads up, glad to know someone could have broken in and done what they wanted and I‚Äôd have been none the wiser. They have no idea when the problem will be fixed but it will ‚Äúautomatically fix itself‚Äù after an unknown amount of time. Not sure how the device will update itself when it can‚Äôt connect to the network but sure, ok. They basically brushed me off the phone and said sorry, not sorry. Thanks for the $200 paperweight Ring.... I‚Äôll be going with a better product and a company that cares about its customer security next time. With so many options on the market please do yourself a favor and go with a different product and a different company people.	positive

My street gets a lot of traffic during the day so my alerts are constantly going off. I have 3 zones (street, directly on my driveway, and then another with a tree that is always setting off my alerts with the wind). I would like to be able to disable the tree all together and the street part of my zones during the day but have it on at night for security reasons. My doorbell has almost my neighbors entire yard with kids constantly running around. I would like to disable that during the day then on at night. I hope Ring considers this in their next update! Other than that, no problems at all. I do notice my phone takes longer to pop up after motion is detected than my iPad does. My tablets come up almost immediately whereas my phone takes a good 20 seconds. Doesn‚Äôt seem long, but it is when you‚Äôre trying to check what is going on outside. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs my phone since the other devices are fine. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I have the Ring Doorbell Pro and Wired Spotlight Cam.	positive
1033	926252661	utility	2	"When I first got the ring doorbell I was beyond pleased with the idea of what it offered for the price. After installing learning about the monthly fee for something that seemed to me implied with original purchase. I paid over $100, I don't remember exactly but would have tolerated surprise small monthly fee etc if it was reliably fuctional. Mine only works half the time and the battery life is poor at best. The failures are literally across the board, with the most consistent and frusterating LAG!!!! For example I'll come home with grocies and come through the front door with my ring doorbell; literally I've almost out all groceries away by the time I get the notification of motion detected. Those 2+ minutes could be very crucial in am emergency. Which brings me to my final complaint they should update software so that the devices registered as ""owners don't set off the notification bcbitnknowsnits you. I don't usually leave reviews and even fewer negative ones I just feel like potential customers ought to know. With modern technologies are given the opportunity to improve and adapt their product through software updates and unfortunately""Ring,"" seems to have not only missed the opportunity but gotten worse!"	negative
1034	926252661	utility	1	"Have had multiple problems setting up devices. Had them working intermittently. We have one doorbell and 2 chime pros.  Originally the doorbell would open to view a person at door when they rang and I could talk to them. Then we lost that ability and they wanted us to pay extra for that. So I accepted just having a doorbell and not able to see or talk to someone. But the doorbell and chimes keep disconnecting themselves. And when I last has it working, the connection for voice was scratchy, inconsistent, one-way and basically useless. 

The core problem for me is that the product is continually unreliable and I have spent hours trying to get things reconnected. Calling customer service has been a poor experience. They are not patient. They redirect me to the instructions, which I have already tried. I am an older man and they have not taken time to walk me thru things to completion. Even my children have had problems helping me and we were ultimately unsuccessful.  If RING only wants millennials for their product, fine. But this type of product could be very helpful for older people for many reasons. However, not if the product is unreliable and the customer service is so poor. In fact, I can‚Äôt recommend it for anyone of any age."	negative
1035	926252661	utility	1	"I installed the latest update and this is absolutely horrible! It had worked perfectly at door location and without any changes...unchanged router/network or devices. All kind of issues. It starting draining battery even though it was hard wired. I took off connection and charged 100% but it drained down to 70% in a couple hours. It wouldn't detect motion nor could you ring the doorbell..I called ring support and had to remove device reset and then reload on iPhone...very nice but it took at least 20min. It is now charging at door but wireless signal is poor. The reset made it work briefly then now it's back to poor signal and can't view device. Even when you can get a view on the camera it is very delayed and pixelated. I have 3 other camera none of which are having issue. The other camera devices were acquired prior to ring and considering switching if this is NOT fixed ASAP. Just wanted to warn everyone prior to agreeing to update. Is this an attempt for the company to try to get users to buy new devices....sort of like apple slowing down iPhones.. just wondering...
Now doorbell won't connect and battery low and not getting email alerts as support promised would happen. Looking for new camera door bell and will place complaint with BBB. Any recommendations on new devices?"	positive
1036	926252661	utility	3	"The Ring devices I‚Äôve had over the years have been excellent.  I had my doubts about solar powered cameras in winter but I‚Äôve only had to swap batteries one time.
The app on the other hand, which is what this review is about, has gotten progressively more complex, annoying and cumbersome.  Internal ads (for ‚Äúnew features‚Äù) distract from real camera views.  You told us once about modes and motion verification, we don‚Äôt need to see a reminder about the ‚Äúgreat new features‚Äù every time we open the app.  The device settings screen now has more tiles than fit on the screen without scrolling.  Either organize this stuff better or let us remove things we don‚Äôt personally need - for me it would be ‚Äúmode settings‚Äù, ‚Äúlinked devices‚Äù, and ‚Äúshared users‚Äù, for others might be something else.
And the message to ‚ÄúAdd a Ring solar panel to Extend Battery Life‚Äù (their caps not mine) continues to appear for cameras *which have a solar panel attached*.  Is there anything more useless than that?
If this keeps up, after another few updates I‚Äôll revise this review down to two stars.  It‚Äôs a shame, you‚Äôd think they could afford to hire app developers who have some sense."	negative
1037	926252661	utility	4	"I‚Äôve been using a Ring doorbell for 3+ years and have been happy with it and the app until today. Today I went to the website and changed my password. After changing out the website immediately logged me out, so I logged back in using the new password. Everything worked as I expected. Then I opened the app on my iPhone and it also asked me to log in again. I tried repeatedly, but consistently was told ‚Äúinvalid credentials‚Äù and after a few tries got a new email asking about the failed logins. So I logged into the website again, with no problem.

After thinking about the situation I decided to try a different password, one with no special characters in it. Now I can log into both the website and the app. Why do you accept a different set of characters in the passwords used on the website and app if you‚Äôre going to share the same password between them???

For what it‚Äôs worth, the characters ^$@! work on both. On the web you can use an asterisk (*) in your password, but then you won‚Äôt be able to log into the app. Why do you permit that without a warning?"	positive

For the past six months or more, it lags like crazy. I thought maybe it is my WiFi but after reading reviews (and checking my WiFi setup and speeds many times), I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs an app problem. I have turned my app notifications off for the last 3 months because it does me no good to get a doorbell notice and not be able to respond to someone at my door because it‚Äôs refreshing and unable to catch up. By the time the video starts playing the person is gone or leaving...same with motion detector mode. I also receive notice about an update for the app every time I open the app but the app seems unable to update‚Äîstarts and never completes. I have an iPhone X with newest updates so it‚Äôs not because my phone is too old. This app is not well supported on the development side. Needs to improve or this product will go away. I‚Äôm currently looking for a better alternative. Disappointed because I was completely sold on this product and was considering expanding into the other products until it went downhill. Glad I didn‚Äôt waste my money.	positive
1039	926252661	utility	2	"We received the Ring doorbell through our security Company and had it installed professionally. The ring door bell has too many pixels in the pictures or images that you see on the video. I don‚Äôt understand why there is a wide range option up to 30 feet when you cannot clearly see a face without thousands of pixels blocking an image. Especially at night on the Night vision we just can‚Äôt see whatever the sensor is picking up clearly. We know there is someone there but we cannot see the face just a bunch of pixel blocking the image and face that is there. Unlike the advertisement on television where there is a perfect image day or night of people trespassing and talking to you through the ring doorbell but in reality that is a lie you cannot see people clearly like that and then the mic is not that clear either when talking to someone.
And We just don‚Äôt understand why there is an option for the sensor to span out to 30 feet when you can only see a bunch of pixel images or face. Were is the security protection in that? The police cannot help you if they cannot see a face The only time you can see a clear face or image of someone on the ring doorbell is if the person is 1 to 4 feet up on your mailbox or ring doorbell. Unbelievable!"	positive
1040	926252661	utility	2	"We upgraded to the ring 2 and have more trouble with this one than we did the older model.  The voice function is worse and barely audible, it has large gaps and delays and sometimes just doesn‚Äôt pick up a thing for hours. It is vital for us to have this work for protection of our Airbnb guests and our property.  It seems that almost every time we‚Äôve caught something that needs reported to Airbnb the video stops working and won‚Äôt pick up a good portion of it.  Recently we had an attempted break in and our front door lock ruined.  The ring picked up the activity around 10 pm with showed them messing with the door but then the ring had a long gap of no activity and it never picked up them leaving or any further activity until some dog ran through the property 4 hours later.  So much for security.  We‚Äôve lost income due to the ring not functioning like it should because Airbnb won‚Äôt reimburse without a video or picture.  
The first ring never shut up &  captured every fly or moth but had a good picture and voice.  This new ring just times out of the blue, delays to record before or after, the picture isn‚Äôt as clear as the first one and just got forget being able to hear any voices clearly."	positive

1042	926252661	utility	2	We have had the doorbell since January, and have waited to leave feedback hoping it would get better, however, sadly, that is not the case.  First of all, it was well into February before we could even use it as it was ‚Äútoo cold‚Äù where we live!  After the weather warmed up to an acceptable temp, we tried again.  The Ring doorbell is supposed to be designed to NOT pick up vehicles, except for very large ones, however, on multiple occassions delivery people and solicitors have walked all the way up to our door and left before it ever picks them up, and we can pull into our driveway and pass the front of the house before it alerts, yet every single vehicle that passes on the road is picked up??  It has become so unreliable that it is of no comfort knowing we have it.  The only thing that works reliably is the doorbell feature, I didn‚Äôt pay $200 for a bell !!!   On the occassion it actually records activity, in the daylight, it is bright white for several seconds before the camera focuses, so by the time it engages, all you see is the person‚Äôs back as they are walking away! At night, unless there is a light on, all you see os black, picks up nothing but darkness!  So VERY disappointed with this expensive doorbell !	negative
1043	926252661	utility	2	Ring makes a decent product for Alerting you of motion, 2 way convo and Day video. However for night video the ring is seriously lacking. This is why I purchased the ring because of frequent vehicle and home break ins. I wanted to be alerted when there was a motion and to share the video with authorities and neighbors when needed.  This night video is a complete joke.  The video is pink when it should be black and white. (Google ‚ÄúRing pink video‚Äù) I‚Äôm not asking for clear color at night. But the option to manually set color or black and white would be great. At least black and white.  I opted for a real 4K security camera with a built in microphone and records to an as card. No monthly/yearly cloud storage which ring banks on again. It also alerts me via mobile app of any motion and allows me to save crystal clear video and audio to my phone for sharing. I‚Äôll use the ring to scream at them seems to be all it‚Äôs good for. Their support is also worthless. Asking for tons of info and never getting the issue resolved.  Over a year of ‚Äúthe next update will allow this or that‚Äù they just read or type from a script no real resolution.  Don‚Äôt waste your money on this product.  Buy the Nest Hello or a real security camera.	positive

PS Do not use a Pro Chime that they offer for free , this will use all your internet speed and shut the camera cam down from working ! The chime alone they offer u for free is good and works but only if you‚Äôre internet speed upload is at least a range of 5.00 . I have that speed now that my carrier gave me for free . Though I have the speed I still had to move my modem closer to the camera cam . They sent me a replacement Camera cam after the Pro Chime stopped it from working! But good luck sending the old one back if you‚Äôre printer is down. I asked for a return label for 15 days to be mailed to me , and got sure no problem, I had to go to STAPLES and print the label !

1045	926252661	utility	1	"Edit: the rapid ring app is a huge improvement but I still have to give ring 1 star for reliability. Notifications stopped coming to my phone altogether. My chime pro failed. What‚Äôs the point of a video doorbell that doesn‚Äôt notify you when someone is ringing it? Ring needs to halt all new product development and put all effort toward fixing their buggy software. The core experience is broken. 

Old review: As others have said Ring needs to work on the core experience of using the app before adding features. When you click a notification or answer the doorbell it is a minimum of 10+ seconds before you get a picture. I always find that I can just walk to the door faster than I can load and connect to the Ring app. I have an iPhone XS Max and 150mbit fiber with Ubiquity WiFi so I know the lag isn‚Äôt due to my hardware or connection. This core experience is one of the most important parts of the product and Ring needs to improve it before I can really recommend their cameras. The slow response time really makes the doorbell and cameras pretty useless for any real time monitoring and communication. The recorded video and motion detection parts work well, but Ring markets these things for their real time functions and that part doesn‚Äôt work very well."	positive
1046	926252661	utility	2	The app has always been a little slow. Not a big deal. It also interrupts your music even if you don‚Äôt watch a video which is a little annoying. I rarely get push notifications about a low battery till I pull the app up and then all the sudden a notification comes through (yes push is enabled and background app refresh). Since Ring has opened this to the public, even without ring, it‚Äôs a joke. I get daily neighborhood notifications from the paranoid recluses that live in bomb shelters. They post comments like ‚Äúthe leaves on my tree were moving but there was no wind‚Äù. People now are posting videos of solicitors. Not to mention when something‚Äôs actually happening people don‚Äôt post cross streets or a general vicinity so somewhere in my 12 sq mile neighborhood somethings happening. I use to appreciate the helpful videos with actual crime prevention. Now I have to shut off these notifications because they are so frequent. This started great and is just going down hill. Of course there‚Äôs a delay in recording from your camera (even with the motion recordings) so you tend to get the back end of someone or nothing at all when it really matters. You‚Äôre better off getting an actually CCTV system if you‚Äôre concerned.	positive
1047	926252661	utility	3	First things first this app needs a panic button. Don‚Äôt do anything else until this has been accomplished. Most people are going to keep their phones on their bedside table, not a keypad. How is this most basic feature missing? Secondly the app is not at all intuitive. It takes forever to perform common tasks. I should be able to view and modify which sensors are active in which mode directly from the dashboard. The mode buttons are RIGHT THERE. No, they want me to be sure so they made the process take 95 steps. And how come I can‚Äôt change the chimes for the entire system? It had to be individually? Really!? I have 14 windows and 3 doors in my house. For heavens sake. The activity logs are individual as well. And please don‚Äôt get me wrong there should be an option to view each sensor‚Äôs log individually but it would be extremely convenient to be able to view a list, and to sort for what I need. I could go on but it‚Äôs 1 am and I‚Äôm sleepy, plus you get the picture. Make it better. I know it‚Äôs a new system and app but this stuff is obvious. Especially the panic button. It‚Äôs a good start. Hurry up with an update.	positive
1048	926252661	utility	1	"Update: product is now worse. This company has figured out that cheerful customer service is cheaper than selling a product that works. Now that there is competition, and the Nest actually works, there is no reason to waste your time with the Ring garbage. Here‚Äôs the thing: people really, really, really want this to work. But like asking for a birthday pony, it isn‚Äôt ever going to happen. This company will take your money, spend hours on customer service calls, then blame the internet for the Ring Pro‚Äôs failures. Hopefully an attorney will sue this company.

Old review.....Warning: it takes 20 to 30 seconds from when someone pushes the doorbell until you hear it on your phone. By then, they‚Äôre gone. The video function is spotty and the device needs troubleshooting every 2-3 days. Many times it doesn‚Äôt start recording until after we‚Äôre in the door or the person has left. 

I‚Äôm sad to say that after spending hours dealing with this device, it just isn‚Äôt ready for prime time. Save your money. The doorbell doesn‚Äôt work, video doesn‚Äôt work, doesn‚Äôt consistently connect to wifi, the motion detector is junk.......This company needs to be sold to a company with sufficient capital to make the necessary capital improvements."	positive
1049	926252661	utility	1	My issue is not generally with the security, but with the impact of having a primary and shared account. My wife has the primary account, and I have the shared account. We need separate accounts because we have very different notification settings. However, as the primary, she has more options than I do. For example, she can get low battery notifications and I can‚Äôt. But I‚Äôll change the batteries. How does this make sense? Our schedules are different and her work is demanding, so the fact that I can‚Äôt receive those notifications is an inconvenience at best. I also can‚Äôt add devices as a shared user. I have to log into the app as my wife to do so. If having a primary user is a security thing, why does ring keep suggesting I log in with her email and password? So while the app can be problematic, the root cause may be that the design of the system having a single primary is flawed, and it makes the app look bad. But like I said, despite these issues, at least we have security that works. That does improve the app score though. I‚Äôm tempted to add a star because what functions in the app does a good job...but I‚Äôve been so aggregated with Ring after spending close to $1000 that I can‚Äôt bring myself to be that gracious.	positive
1050	533365777	travel	4	I‚Äôve been using this app for years, although in recent months, I‚Äôve been using it daily to track and monitor the status of several flights per day. The last 3-4 flights specifically have not had the current status accurately displayed. I also now use another flight tracking app as a backup to tell me when these flights actually land. While the other app shows a particular flight has landed, this app has shown the same flight ‚Äúshould‚Äôve landed...‚Äù whatever number of minutes ago and will show the flight with an updated time it is expected to land which is sometimes actually in the past. This has happened enough times recently that it seems like a glitch in a recent update.  After I‚Äôve picked up whoever was on that inaccurate flight, I will often go back to it and have recently found that it is still shown under those flights that are enroute. They will sometimes have a disclaimer added to them that says the information is out of date and it is because the information has not been submitted by the data provider.   I‚Äôm very hopeful this can be resolved quickly as I have found this app to otherwise be the most helpful in managing to track multiple flights at the same time.	positive
1051	533365777	travel	2	"EDIT: I just learned that the connecting leg of my flight that was marked on this app as delayed is in fact on time. When it comes to travel, it‚Äôs actually better to have no info at all rather than the wrong info. For this reason, I‚Äôm removing the extra star I gave the app for finding the flights (which should kind of be a given for a flight-tracking app anyway).

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Tried giving this app another try after it failed to find my flight the last time I tried it. I gave it a star for finding both the initial and connecting flights this time. Among the issues with the app are a truly non-intuitive interface that requires digging around to find critical options and info while fairly useless info (eg carrier corporate profiles) are accessed by clicking where you‚Äôd expect to find the important info.  There also doesn‚Äôt appear to be any way to see how long your flight is delayed, only the fact that it is delayed, so you don‚Äôt know whether you need to make alternative arrangements either for air or ground transportation. Ultimately I only had this installed for 10 minutes; if I can‚Äôt get critical flight info in that amount of time (either because it‚Äôs not available in the app or because locating it in the app takes so long due to the interface), then the app isn‚Äôt serving its intended purpose."	negative
1052	533365777	travel	5	No other flight tracker app comes close to Flight Tracker. You can save and view any flight you want to the ‚ÄòMy Flights‚Äô tab, organize your flights according to trips you‚Äôre going to take in the ‚ÄòTrips‚Äô tab, see interactive maps of any flight you choose, get all the information you need about any airport in the world (delays, terminal maps, etc.), get airplane info and seat maps for the flights you‚Äôre tracking or have saved, and so much more. You can also customize notifications to remind you of departures and arrivals. I haven‚Äôt even scraped the surface yet but I don‚Äôt know how many people are going to read a novel in the AppStore reviews. I will say that the app little tricky to navigate at first but that‚Äôs only because it has so many features. You just have to take a little bit of time to sit down and figure out everything the app has to offer!	positive
1053	533365777	travel	4	"I used FlightTracker for almost 3 years when I was commuting across the U.S. The software never let me down. I always knew what time to ask for a pickup or in turn to pick up a loved one, friend, or acquaintance who needed the assistance. 

FlightTracker is very easy to use on either a desktop computer, a mobile smart phone or another web-enabled device. The app only takes a minute to load without asking for all kinds of identification or money. I truly appreciate the service.

Statistics on the desktop version is interesting. I‚Äôve also used those stats to determine route patterns and times. Once you take a deep dive you to will be convinced of its features and utility...there‚Äôs my plane, gotta go. Get FlightTracker so you know when to come and go."	positive
1054	533365777	travel	3	"This app is so much worse than it used to be before the major overhaul they did on the structure/UI.  I don't think I it has improved in any way since then, but here is what has gotten worse:
(1) it freezes and crashes more often
(2) it separates flights into buckets - upcoming and past.  The old UI just had one long list which was super easy to navigate.  And now it's actually harder to find you old flights to reference
(3) I have completed flights from weeks ago that it still shows as ""in progress""
(4) I used to love the list of flights because I could always go back and look at all of my flights for the year - now that is harder to do with the awkward layout and it is inaccurate because of the issues I've mentioned already
(5) it's no longer intuitive functionality.

Please bring back the old format of the app!

It hasn't happened in the new app but this app used to tell me my flight was delayed or changed well before the airline' site did which is a good feature. Not sure if I've just had flights with fewer changes or if that is no longer the case, but it has always been a major pro for this app."	positive
1055	533365777	travel	2	"I‚Äôm going to see if I can find a similar, more simple app...

I got this years ago to find flights of any airlines between cities.  It was very useful!

Then ‚Äúupdates‚Äù were made.  Southwest flights through 3-4 layovers showed up, instead of just direct flights, crowding the screen.  Not that big of an issue (I did have to take multiple screen shots to capture the flights)... until more updates and the partner airlines scroll with the US airline.  When I go to an airport, I look for Delta, for example... not one of its 5 partners.  Now the screen shots have to be timed to capture United, American and Delta.

Ok, workable, I guess.  But now each partner airline shows up separately, IN ADDITION to the US airline... which still scrolls through all the partner names.  This makes departures for one city to ONE other city exceed 50 listings and the app will not show all flights anymore (despite actual departures being 10-15).

This needs to have an area to choose specific airline(s), quickly, with a search typing the first few characters.  NOT a scroll selection where, for example, United Airlines appears at the bottom of hundreds.  1-6 airlines in selection boxes."	positive
1056	533365777	travel	3	This is a great program. Have used it for years. I paid a one time fee to in the past until they changed it to a subscription service. I don‚Äôt fly that much anymore, but I was flying for a month this year so wanted to use it again. I signed up for a month of premium upgrade, but there is no easy way to unsubscribe. Seems rather crafty and not user-friendly. I would be more apt to buy the one year upgrade if I was going to use it routinely. This traps users into buying at least one extra month which I find distasteful. Other apps make it much easier to opt out of the subscription costs. It should be right there in general settings. But I can't find it.	positive
1057	533365777	travel	5	I‚Äôve tried other flight trackers that need babysitting (constant refreshing) or are flat out unintuitive. I love how I can add ‚Äúmy flights‚Äù for arrivals to my local airport and then get real-time updates throughout the day. This makes it extremely efficient for pickups from the airport. I mean how often is a flight actually on time?!  They‚Äôre either early or oftentimes really delayed.  The best thing about the app is the little airplane ‚Äúcabin ding‚Äù alert sound any time there is a status change.  It makes me smile every time.  To the developers of this app... well done and thank you!	positive

Although they say the maps after included in the premium, I don't even care that I don't have them.. I paid to get rid of that ad. So... Remove the ads or refund the subscriber fees.

Update: although I was initially contacted and told the problem would be addressed, it still pops up adds selling weather map and alerts. I'm giving it 10 days and if it's not fixed, I request my subscription (which is still valid through November) be fully refunded and I'll seek another app for travel. Alerts and weather DO work, but it still constantly advertises to purchase."	negative

I forgot that the WiFi did not work well out in the country and tried to download their and by the time I got and, heehee, I had to download again. This took most of the day and part of the night to fin the download. Well, I got it and am still trying to figure out the system. That I don‚Äôt mind. Just being aware is what truly matters. Thanks to you all who started the program.	positive
1060	533365777	travel	2	"I used to be able to fully rely on this app, but no longer. I keep trying to search for a flight but come up with ‚Äúflight not found‚Äù. This happens well in advance of the date, close to the date, and I have even been sitting at the airport waiting for that flight. 

I used to get notifications on gate changes that showed up prior to the announcement , so I knew I could relax and be confident to have updated information. That function has been unreliable lately, which means I don‚Äôt get to relax until i have actually boarded. 

I checked to make sure I have the IOS updates and update the app when there are updates, so I am confident the problem is not at my end."	positive
1061	533365777	travel	1	"This may not be the typical use case, but I‚Äôm tracking my wife‚Äôs trip to and from JFK. I input the flight number and it shows a simplified cartoon-like icon of the plane headed for NYC. The arrival data seems accurate.
On her return trip, it‚Äôs the same flight number, but the map view now shows two planes, one going one way and the other going the opposite direction in the same path. The ‚Äúgauges‚Äù at the airport are devoid of information. Strange. 
I switched to FlightAware and that app showed there was a storm system in the way and it accurately tracked the aircraft as it changed course and speed to avoid it. I used Accuweather to confirm the storm and it appears spot on.
I like the near-realtime data and tracking of FlightAware and will switch to that for now."	neutral
1062	533365777	travel	5	Love the app and it‚Äôs accuracy. UI and notifications are clear and easy to understand. I just wish it would have more realistic flight maps instead of a straight line between the departing and arriving airports. Also with it could pick up on 4 different aircraft times (gate push back, takeoff, landing, and arrival at destination gate) and send alerts for each one in notifications. That would make this an EXCELLENT app!	positive
1063	533365777	travel	1	"I‚Äôm not willing to pay for the subscription so I‚Äôm rating the free version:

The adds are very annoying. I added two flights to My Flights and I tried to figure out heads or tails of the list and wanted to see details. I see a time and City, but no specifics, flight number or much else. I could not find a way to open the flight. I was looking for departure time and it looks like I have arrival time? It did not make any sense. It seems like it‚Äôs more important for me to figure out future flight plans than the ones I currently have!!! Big ads and small ones attached to each flight.

This is no good if you‚Äôre in a hurry and I know we all are!!!"	positive
1064	533365777	travel	5	I thought I‚Äôd give this app a try since I was having trouble locating a flight using ‚ÄúFlight Aware‚Äù. The flight was added at the last minute to accommodate several pax booted off United the day before due to ‚Äúweight restrictions‚Äù. But, it only showed up on United‚Äôs website. This app doesn‚Äôt show precise flight info for ANY flight I tried to find and seems overly burdened with intrusive ads. DELETED.	negative
1065	533365777	travel	5	"Used to be good get hit with an ad after searching for a flight. Now it‚Äôs after every action. Want to see a flight‚Äôs details? Full screen ad.  Open the app up to your saved flights? Full screen ad. 

Even the list of saved flights has half the screen‚Äôs real estate covered by ads leaving enough room for just 3 flights to be displayed on each page."	positive
1066	533365777	travel	2	I downloaded this app and really liked the interface. Very easy to use. However, the first two flights it tracked never worked. Constantly said, for unknown reasons the flight is delayed and vendor is not updating data. For this to happen with two different flights several weeks apart means they have real issues. Not a vendor problem as I jumped to another flight tracker and the flight was halfway there and tracking fine. Definitely won‚Äôt pay for the upgrade when the free version doesn‚Äôt work. Garbage.	positive
1067	533365777	travel	3	"I have an airport transportation service and rely on up to the minute exact information 
Unfortunately compared to the old flight tracker that can not hold up
Several times I noticed that future flight are gone from "" my flights"",often it shows me a delay and then it ends up in a 10 Minutes early or it shows me in the air when in reality it was landed 10 minutes ago
I hope the developer will improve the App on the other hand others are worst"	positive
1068	533365777	travel	2	"Notifications quit working in a recent update, and a flight tracker without notifications is pretty much useless. 

So, I deleted the app and reinstalled it. When I go to turn notifications on from within the app, it says to turn them on in the iOS settings and offers to transfer me there. The funny thing is there is no notification setting in the app‚Äôs settings or in the setting for the Notification Center‚Äîthe app isn‚Äôt even listed!

I could tolerate some of the other quirks with this app, but this is the worst."	negative
1069	533365777	travel	5	"I have found flight tracker to be a good way to keep a list of my and my family‚Äôs flights. It is easy to use. It is helpful to see all flight codes for a flight.
Two suggestions-Show the progress of the plane in terms of a real time icon.
Improve the flight maps - these are confusing.
Overall Flight Tacker is the best app of its kind."	positive
1070	533365777	travel	1	"About 1/3 of he flights I enter aren‚Äôt in their very incomplete database. I contacted their support and they acknowledged.
Their reply ‚Äú Unfortunately our system and data supplier for flight information isn‚Äôt perfect at the moment, and we‚Äôre currently investigating some problems with the flight data. Because of this it might happen that flights, gates or terminals aren‚Äôt found, or that the app shows conflicting information, for which we would like to apologise. We have plans to improve our flight data servers, and want to cover as much data as possible with this, but I can‚Äôt say when this will be implemented. 

The adding of new data and improving our current system is a difficult and long process, so it will take some time unfortunately, and we won‚Äôt be able to guarantee a 100% coverage of all flights in the world.

Our apologies for the inconvenience.

With kind regards,"	positive
1071	533365777	travel	5	The best App for tracking visitors and knowing about flight issues to resolve enroute - much better than all the different Apps, one from each airline - we also track our own flights with this App to know what gate we land at and to make plans with airport terminal maps to run to our next gate and since using this app I‚Äôve rarely missed a connection!	positive
1072	533365777	travel	5	As someone who travels a lot this app has been super valuable in figuring out the maze of flights, transfers and connections, delays, terminal changes, etc. It‚Äôs been valuable enough where I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve wanted to pay for it to support the team behind it. However every time I try to subscribe a bug prevents me from doing so. I‚Äôll keep trying...	positive
1073	533365777	travel	2	I wanted to love this.  But am about to bury it in a discard folder.  The tracking is totally inaccurate. It sends you notices that a flight has already left and gives you a time that is still up to 15 min away.  It can see into the future?  No, it can‚Äôt.  Adding insult to injury, it will show a flight as being airborne and 100 miles into the route on the map, when the flight is still on the ground, delayed.   Worthless if the info is not more accurate than this. Reprogram this app or pull it off the store.  Embarrassing.	negative
1074	533365777	travel	1	"With the latest update the developer removed the+ icon that allows you to add a flight. Instead they replaced it with a magnifier to help search for flights. After emailing the developer, two days later, the developer answered and informed me that now you have to click on the magnifier, select the flight and then a pop up opens a sling if you want to add the flight. 
The old way of directly adding the flight by way of a + icon was much simpler and done in one step instead of  the way it is now. 
For now, I‚Äôll keep both, FLIGHT TRACKER and FLIHHT VIEW on my phone and decide later which one I keep. 
Bottom line: Flight Tracker was an awesome app and nothing would compare to it. Now, it‚Äôs just another app and it just depends on which is more reliable.
You can‚Äôt change an existing flight. You can only delete it and then make changes. 
Terrible app. The sad thing is that there is nothing better!"	negative
1075	533365777	travel	5	This is a fantastic app.  It easily tracks flights with departure time, a flight map & arrival time, along with notifications of when the flight has landed.  It‚Äôs easy to find any flight you‚Äôre looking for by airline and flight number or by city of departure and arrival.  Highly recommended.	positive

1077	533365777	travel	1	Tracking my husbands flight which got diverted. It was from Texas to Florida, a storm happened at destination and they were rerouted to another airport to refuel. I got a notification that the flight was delayed, then the ‚Äúinteractive radar‚Äù just put the flight back out into the Gulf of Mexico to, I am assuming, make up for the time delay. So literally, you‚Äôre watching the plane progress along a ‚Äútimeline‚Äù that‚Äôs drawn from point a to point b. No real time. Try flightradar24 at least they accurately report the reason for the delay and the plane‚Äôs actual location.	negative
1078	533365777	travel	1	I purchased this app and loved the features and reliability; however, recently they changed the business model.  I paid for an ad-free version and now there are invasive ads with a required yearly fee to remove them.  I already paid for the ad free application. I get it, they have to stay solvent.  But, why not make the subscription include new pro features rather than taking away functionality from a user who paid for the full version of the app originally.  This is not a way to treat customers who helped fund their business.	positive
1079	533365777	travel	3	"Very annoying that they force advertisements into every search even though I‚Äôve paid for the app. 

Not a great user experience as it‚Äôs not always intuitive on how to navigate within the app and the flights you‚Äôve save.  It also brings up banner adds over the airport/flight codes so more scrolling on the screen is necessary than could be

The real time map tracking of the flight is cool. Good real time departure/arrival info."	positive
1080	533365777	travel	2	I downloaded this app to track family flights. The main reason was to see the flight progress in real time on the map but unfortunately the map just shows the plane icon at the origin airport even though it has been in the air for some hours. It seems like the app has potential but this is a major setback. I resorted to using flight trackers on the internet instead since their maps show the real-time progress of the flights on their maps.	positive
1081	533365777	travel	5	If I were building an app that tracked flights I would include the time from destination and distance from arrival airport easily contained on the home screen. Most people are tracking one plane for one reason. To go to the airport and meet the flight. This app might give you that info but god if I know how to find it	positive
1082	533365777	travel	5	My wife and I have a very busy travel schedule over the next few months and needed an application that provides us with a simple, quick way to determine flight status. Flight Tracker offers that service in an easy-to-use application. Thank You Flight Tracker!	positive
1083	533365777	travel	3	Like other reviews I miss the old Mobiata app. I tried to add an itinerary and the app could not find the return flight. Tried again the next day and it did. More importantly I cannot get any notifications to work. I have them all  enabled in the app and in the notifications setting in my phone but nothing alerts. Unless this gets fixed I will have to search for alternative app.	positive
1084	533365777	travel	5	I love this app, I travel often most of the time time it‚Äôs really random, so  to know what flights are flying from each airport on each day really helps me have all the options. There are definitely some ways it can be made more user friendly, but the concept is awesome!	positive
1085	533365777	travel	5	I never write reviews honestly... but this app is very user friendly. It has everything! Updated airplane position, seats, time, .....When I tell you everything about your flight, I mean it including how many flight assistants are flying and even who make the airplane and in which Year, lol. Very nice app.	positive
1086	533365777	travel	2	"How hard can it be to track the flight from Chicago to San Diego with a layover? The trip feature is broken, they are more interested in showing you an advertisement than they are in getting the data right. 

Are used to relying on this app heavily, and had paid for it. Now I come back and see that my paid for app is now a subscription that I do not have access to. Thanks for taking my money and then asking for more."	positive

1088	533365777	travel	4	I find watching the flight tracker radar relaxing. In fact, as a stress reliever - as opposed to watching the news or doing something that raises the blood pressure - activity like watching flight tracker in my case is just what the doctor ordered. The bonus is having the app available when waiting for someone to arrive at the airport. Thank you!	positive
1089	533365777	travel	3	"It's a little klunky to figure out, sometimes hard to read the flight list, it would better if there was an option to only list nonstop flights. I miss my old app, FlightPro, don't know why they stopped supporting it, it was great. Haven't found anything like it. 

It was working well on gate info for a long time, but lately Southwest Airlines‚Äô flights are not showing any gate information."	positive
1090	533365777	travel	4	Accurate info. The interface could be a little more user friendly. Gave 4 stars because it does not allow a user to check multi-leg flights on different airlines. Example: JFK-HKG with 1-stop using a combination of airlines and connection city‚Äôs in the results. Would give five stars otherwise.	positive
1091	533365777	travel	5	"It isn‚Äôt clear if this is a free app or a paid app. If the app automatically renews and charges my credit card, this is fraud as the app never asked for permission. 

I would appreciate any clarification and if otherwise, I will be happy to change my rating."	positive
1092	533365777	travel	5	I have a friend who is a Mr. Gadget and he tuned me in to this App! I love it! Was waiting for my sister in Las Vegas and her flight got delayed and rerouted. I was getting updates on what was going on with her flight before she even knew. I could see what airport she was rerouted to. When she landed and when she took off again .... amazing!!!	positive
1093	533365777	travel	3	I used to really love this app, well, honestly I still do and it‚Äôs my go to for all the info I need but it has turned into nothing but ads... after literally every search I do, an ad pops up. It‚Äôs really annoying. I get it. It‚Äôs a free app and they need to earn some cash but it‚Äôs really become annoying to use and I‚Äôm looking for an alternative app to use just because of it.	positive
1094	533365777	travel	4	I‚Äôve tried other flight tracker apps but the original is still has the best information and is the easiest to use. I would give 5 ***** it‚Äôs annoying to be asked nearly everyday to purchase premium, I would not mind being asked at the most once a month.	positive
1095	533365777	travel	1	I loved this app and did not mind the ads, but the latest version has full screen ads pop up after every click. In some cases it is near impossible to click out of the ad without accidentally clicking the ad and ending up in their web page (I‚Äôm sure this is what they want because the will get paid more for this). The free version is now unusable and there are plenty of lower cost alternatives that work.	positive
1096	533365777	travel	2	It takes 15 minutes or more for real time updates to show up. On a 10 hour flight this may not seem like much, but when you‚Äôre looking at a flight taking off or landing it can be on the ground for 15 minutes before you know what‚Äôs actually going on. What‚Äôs the point of having a tracker that is only giving you historic information...	positive
1097	533365777	travel	5	There are better apps for all kinds of things related to flying; however, I can think of no app that tracks flights better than The Flight Tracker app. If you need to track a flight, this is your app.	positive
1098	533365777	travel	1	I downloaded this app after reading the reviews and I wish I hadn't- it's terrible!!! It's extremely inaccurate and hard to use. Gave very little information as to the flight status and when it did it was hard to understand. First it said landed, then it was back in the air, then landed, then back in the air again, then I had no clue what happened to it!  I'm going back to Flight Aware. Had that one on at the same time and it gave me all the information I needed!	positive
1099	533365777	travel	3	This is the best app after discontinued ‚ÄúFlight Track‚Äù but still I can not say that I‚Äôm not missing ‚ÄúFlight Track‚Äù which was the best app ever per my opinion.

1100	368677368	travel	3	"I heard so many good stories about people using Uber and being pleased with its service, but when my wife and I reached Los Angeles and decided to use it I found out the harsh reality. Unfortunately, Uber has become a master of deception using its large user base to suggest confidence, but after getting a quote for a little over 40 dollars, my wife and I ended up getting charged almost 100 dollars because of difference in ‚Äútime‚Äù and ‚Äúdistance.‚Äù I would be fine if that were the truth, but instead we had a driver that wasn‚Äôt focused and missed his exit, then his phone died and we had to use our own phones to guide him. This resulted in us having to drive another 30 minutes just because their own driver didn‚Äôt plan ahead or pay attention to the road. I will NEVER use Uber again because the only thing they did to ‚Äúfix‚Äù the problem was give me 5 Uber bucks without any notification and then ignore any requests sent via app to find a proper resolution. So much for customer ‚Äúsupport.‚Äù
                    UPDATE
After a few days of trying to find out how to talk with support staff directly I was able to reach a satisfying solution. I believe the best way to avoid situations like this would be to make the app send a notification when support staff message you, instead of you having to dig and find out where to talk to them. Because of their understanding I may use Uber again, but just be wary about knowing where to contact anyone in case of a bad ride."	positive
1101	368677368	travel	3	I have used Uber on several occasions, mainly without issue.  I have always been pleased with their quick response, but today was a horror show.  I ordered the Uber at 8:50 am. My confirmation said the car was 2 minutes away.  I could see on the app where the car was and where it was trying to go.  The driver was trying to follow the GPS which was telling it to drive through a school complex. Living just the other side of that complex, I know that no public traffic is allowed through those roads during school hours. What was frustrating was watching on the app not once, but 4 times, the driver trying to drive through the complex on roads that were closed. When all was said and done,  after getting directions from a school security guard, she finally made her way to pick me up at 9:20am. I was waiting on the street with my bags for 30 minutes as I watched all of this unfolding on the app. The driver was very polite and apologetic, but the bottom line was this...I was aggravated, and late for my appointment because of the GPS sending the driver through non public roads, and the driver not figuring out that it was not possible to go the way the GPS wanted her to go. Waiting until your fourth fail attempt is too many before you ask for help or find a plan B.  I have always been a supporter of Uber in the past because of their past service, but after this episode, I may have to think twice about using them.	negative
1102	368677368	travel	3	Firstly, let‚Äôs talk about the poor GPS system Uber has as of late. I‚Äôve have three Uber‚Äôs cancel on me in one day while I was trying to make it to work on time bc Uber put the wrong location for my pickup even after I chose my home as the pickup location. This has happened on several occasions and I had to dispute cancellation fees and ride fees. Then, on more than one occasion I had the unfortunate case of my Uber starting the trip without me in the car and I had to cancel the ride and again dispute cancellation charges. And last but not least I want to touch on the Ride Pass and why I advise that you don‚Äôt waste your money on it. The way the Ride Pass is advertised you would think that you get a set fare for all of your rides as long as they‚Äôre within New York City. Well that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth because as it turns out the ‚Äúset fare‚Äù only applies to the places (to and from) in which you were going when you purchased the Ride Pass. So let‚Äôs say you were going from home to work and they gave you a set pool price and a set X price that only applies to you going from home to work and back. Every other ride is priced at the flat rate fare and it‚Äôs subject to change every time. All and all it‚Äôs a scam, ten dollars isn‚Äôt much but it‚Äôs the principle and the false advertisement that‚Äôs going on with the purchase of a Ride Pass. So if you want to save yourself ten dollars I say skip on the Ride Pass and just stick to the regular prices.	negative
1103	368677368	travel	3	"If you need a cheap ride and you need to get somewhere then I agree Uber is for that. However they need to fix some issues that keep me from wanting me to. For starters the seller fees are absolutely ridiculous! I should not have to be charged for my drivers errors. I have had numerous occasions of being charged a $5 fee for my driver not being able to find my house. Which brings me to my next problem. 

The GPS navigation they have going is a mess. My old house was a difficult yet not impossible location to find. The u-turn by the gas station was right by the driveway to my house which is easy to miss. However I have tried contacting my Uber drivers giving them guidance. Some still ended up canceling. I have had drivers that would decide it was better to take a longer way for certain places rather than back ways and shortcuts. That also makes everything 10 times  worse, because I have been late to work even scheduled ahead of time since these problems with your system have occurred. 

I‚Äôm also currently disabled and can‚Äôt/shouldn‚Äôt drive, because of it. However I can‚Äôt blame Uber for being late for work even though it most certainly is. I take my job seriously so apparently I need to go back to Lyft since I haven‚Äôt had any of these issues personally. They even found my house in the dark! Uber needs to fix some stuff before I even think of trying to rely on them again."	negative
1104	368677368	travel	3	Uber is Uber, it‚Äôs as good as lyft but pricier, we call know what we‚Äôre getting with Uber. What you may not know is the customer service is an absolute joke. They literally won‚Äôt give out a number to call or email, and as far as I can see online, they literally don‚Äôt have one (even though their website currently says they do give you the number), or if they do they‚Äôve done a great job of making it very unintuitive to find. What they do is, give you a preset list of 4 or 5 possible issues you may have with a specific ride (so no complaints if 5 drivers in a row cancel right before they are at your location). If you click on the thing from the list they just run your trip through some automated program that determines if you get your money back. My most recent incident my driver took a terrible route, then took two wron turns, adding 30 minutes to what was originally estimated to be a 30 minute trip total, and the navigation app he was using said it would be another 30 minutes. At that point it was literally quicker to walk the last 1 ¬Ω miles. So I got out and walked, but it shows up as me having completed the trip, so whether I select driver took poor route or trip was too long, it just spits out an answer based on incomplete information. Clear lack of effort on their part, luckily for me they have competitors that care about the customer experience more then they do.	positive
1105	368677368	travel	3	When deciding wether to use Uber, Lyft or take a taxi, I need accurate pickup times. Increasingly, they are wrong and seem to be a bait and switch. Routinely, the app says, for example, it will take 3 minutes to be picked up so, i request ride. But as soon as a driver confirms pickup, the time until pickup becomes a lot longer. And regardless of the pickup time listed, 9 of 10 times it takes considerably longer for the driver to arrive. I can‚Äôt tell If this is an app or driver problem or both.  Regarding the app, it looks to me like bait and switch. Get me to select a ride with short pickup time, and suddenly after selecting the ride double it or more. And even the extended time is wrong and the driver takes longer to arrive. This problem continues to worsen.  I also now sometimes see drivers not responding to rides, at least on the app. On the driver location, I‚Äôll see a driver sit without moving for minutes before coming to get me. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a problem with the app or the driver accepting a ride and taking his to time before coming to get me. This happened at an airport pickup last night again. I walked past the cabs because it showed a 3 minute pickup time But actial pickup was 10 min and i could have practically been home already in the taxi. For the first 5 min the driver sat where he was when he accpeted to ride. I need reliability.	negative
1106	368677368	travel	5	"UBER is a really great service for me. I ride a motorcycle most of the time but I don't ride when the weather is bad or when I am going to the grocery store and getting more groceries than I can carry on my bike , or if the roads are slick. today I got a little frustrated when I could not just hit  ""home"" after shopping at Publix as I was repeatedly given a different pick up point that though it was nearby I would have had to carry several bags of groceries in the rain to the pick up point. after several failed attempts at hitting ""Home"" as my destination and my pickup point as ""Publix"" I got my UBER driver to pick me up right in front of Publix and had another great ride home. I am not happy with UBER trying several times to direct me to another pickup point in the pouring rain. Why did UBER expect me to got to a more ""convenient pick up point"" which was only more convenient for the driver, not the passenger. Not a good thing to make me waste my time with such foolishness. The UBER drivers are getting paid for picking up a passenger wherever he or she is currently located and taking them to wherever it is they need to go.  If UBER was trying to make improvements to their service this is ""NOT"" the way to do that in my opinion, just saying."	negative
1107	368677368	travel	1	"The driver's app must be broken as uber seems to feel the need to call the rider and ask them where they are and where they're going. Perhaps, the drivers aren't able to see what the customer has typed, the map, the address, gps, the live blue dot and the live symbolic car that represents the car that the uber driver is driving. Those all must be buggy as well.  Maybe, the maps are incorrect, too? The drivers can't seem to use gps and a live location from the passenger (blue dot) to find where they're going or where the passenger is waiting. 
Rating system has problems as well. Star ratings can't be used to choose a driver. If the driver accepts and he or she has a low rating, you can cancel, but expect to pay the penalty fee. Driver's cancel all the time, but are not charged a fee. Perhaps a system error is to blame as no one would chose an arbitrary rating system except an old tv show where the points don't matter. 
Final app issue: wait times. When the app says, five minutes away, it really means 12-15 minutes away. You can cancel, but your credit card will be charged each and every time unless you dispute the charge. Maybe, it's supposed to be like that? Seems counterintuitive, and unlike a similar app that doesn't have incorrect wait times, penalties for customers and an arbitrary rating system where the points don't matter. The drivers on that app just do their job and silently come to the blue dot."	negative

When he checked his client book he said the company had given him a different address and he couldn‚Äôt take me unless I changed it to the right destination address. When I told him to get in tough with the company he said he was ‚Äúnew at this and didn‚Äôt know how to do it‚Äù and asked me if I could change it on my end. They had given him an address in Richmond Road, and I was going to Lake Success on New Hyde Park Road. I had an area on my phone that showed the same destination address as his. I was so frustrated and knew I was going to miss my appointment. Then I was an area where I could change the wrong destination to the right one. When I did that the driver said that he finally received the same address on his pager or what ever it showed on, and he finally took me to the doctor in Lake Success. This morning - Saturday August 31st I received a note from Uber saying that ‚Äú to my cancelling of the Richmond Road address I am being charged over $6 as a cancellation fee!‚Äù I can‚Äôt find a phone number to contact them so I wrote my reply in the section where you can give a note of your experience with the driver. This was the worst experience I have had so far with Uber! I just hope I get my refund without any haste. Be wary folks.	negative
1109	368677368	travel	4	I am overall very satisfied with the app and take it basically every day. However, I have had 2 issues recently that if fixed would make it AMAZING.  I live in NYC and normally take uber pool.  I have no problem walking a few blocks, however sometimes the place I‚Äôm walking to is not possible for the driver to get to without going very out of the way.  There have been a lot of updates to traffic patterns in NYC in the last 6 months and I don‚Äôt think uber gps has been updated with these. (Example: no left turn allowed onto 8th Avenue going east on 14th street - this is my typical pickup location and the driver usually has to spend 5 minutes driving around the block unless I text him to meet me elsewear). The other problem which is a recent one that has happened the past 2 days is that I get matched with a very convenient driver, walk to the pickup location very happily and then they cancel. The next drivers (multiple) I am matched with are extremely far away (up to 10 minutes) and I am forced to cancel and get into a yellow cab because I am now late.  Drivers should not be able to cancel when they are that close to picking up their rider, especially with uber pool where that person has most likely walked decently far to get there.	negative
1110	368677368	travel	2	"Since the new update, there has been a process to get an Uber pool. It involves meeting your Uber at a determined location, this is very good and an excellent way to mainstream the process and make it more efficient.
But unfortunately the AI in control of matching the rider with the Uber seems to be based on distance away from the rider instead of actual logistics.
This is a problem for me since my pickup spots are always near an highway/expressway on street level (BQE in NYC) and the Ubers that are matched to me are always traveling on said expressway instead of on the side streets. Because of this, I've been matched with multiple Ubers that are traveling on the expressway and who's nearest exit is 30 minutes away. Due to this fact I couldn't even cancel the Uber since I would be charged a 5 dollar fee for due to the driver having to drive past me. 
This leaves me with 3 options either take the 5 dollar fee and call another Uber or to call the driver and ask them to cancel the pick-up. Wait an extra half-hour for an uber. The 2nd option is often met with hostility with some drivers, and the 3rd option is just not feasible due to the driver having to drive back and then drop you off adding an extra hour to the commute. 
Please take a look at this problem as it is extremely frustrating to book an Uber only to be late and frustrated at the process."	negative
1111	368677368	travel	3	I started off loving this app and now I‚Äôve been using it for more than a year and it gets worse and worse. My first problem is the ETA of an Uber. When you request a ride it tells you the least amount of time you will wait but when it finds you a ride its 9minutes away. This morning alone I had to cancel 3 trips because they were more than 7 minutes away and by the 4th request an Uber was just 2minutes away. Why couldnt I get matched with the closest uber first?? Then my next problem and probably the worst is the Uber‚Äôs navigation. One example was a trip i took from the bronx to Yonkers and the navigation led the Uber all the way downtown to 138th street to then loop us around to go uptown to 231st. How? When I could look at the GPS and find several other routes that were quicker and less of a hassle. And finally, i want to mention that i dont even use the pool option anymore because it feels like taking the bus. I sat in a pool once and before I got to my stop we picked up and dropped off 4 other people. I wouldnt have minded if it was on the way to my destination but it was so out of the way I considered getting out and taking the bus. I have to take alot of cabs because of work and I‚Äôm always disappointed with Uber, if I had a better option I wouldnt use this app anymore.	negative
1112	368677368	travel	2	When I first started using uber it was fine, but now it takes 10+ minutes for my rides to get to me even though I live part time in a really popular city (Phoenix) and there have been MANY MANY times where a driver is driving away from me, sitting in one spot, WASTING MY TIME, and I can‚Äôt cancel the ride without a fee. I have places I have to be, work being one of them, I can‚Äôt have drivers wasting my time. I already have to spend money on a ride, I shouldn‚Äôt have fees for bad service!! Right now as we speak my driver has been ‚Äúcompleting another trip‚Äù sitting in the same spot for the last 10 minutes and I shouldn‚Äôt be charged a fee because my driver doesn‚Äôt want to do his job. And now he‚Äôs driving AWAY from his drop off spot for his other trip, making my wait time way longer. I‚Äôve been waiting 20 minutes and he‚Äôs still 13 minutes away. This is ridiculous!!!!!! I‚Äôm paying this guy $23 he does not deserve!! By far the worst experience I‚Äôve had. I‚Äôd use lyft more if I didn‚Äôt have some of the same issues sometimes and if they weren‚Äôt occasionally more expensive. I don‚Äôt know why these services went so down hill. I dread using uber to get places now because I know I‚Äôm probably going to have an issue. You bet my current driver is going to get an awful review. Give people the option to cancel rides without fees!!! We shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with bad drivers!	negative
1113	368677368	travel	5	This is my first time using Uber and my first time to write a review about anything. I‚Äôve never felt the need or the want to do so before this but after reading all the negative the reviews when I downloaded the app I felt that I needed to. The only reason I downloaded the app after reading one bad review after another was because I had no other option.I had missed the last bus running for the day and couldn‚Äôt get a hold of anyone to get a ride from. I was stuck and my phones battery was low from calling people. Now I‚Äôm desperate So I very reluctantly Downloaded The app. I was skeptical And was ready to deleted the app at the first sign of any problem.  I was quite pleased to find that app was straightforward and very easy to use. After entering  all my information and my destination a pick up time was Scheduled. I didn‚Äôt have to wait long and I received a text when my ride was a minute away. By the time walked outside the driver was pulling up. My driver greeted me nicely and he was very professional and polite. He chose the fastest route to my destination drove the speed limit at all times and was all around a good driver. I have to say my first experience with Uber was great and would definitely use Uber again.	positive
1114	368677368	travel	4	When I am using the Uber app in a different country, such as Australia and Mexico, as I have been to both in the past three weeks. I really wish Uber would give you the option of seeing miles instead of kilometers, and also American dollars currency. I would have used Uber sooo much more it having that option to change in settings. For example, I used it today in Mexico. I wanted to go to a certain store. I put it in the Uber app, and it showed around $40, I thought it must be really far. Looking at the map, it showed kilometers. Then I noticed it was showing the cost in pesos. I had no idea how far it really was, or what it would charge me in American currency. SUCH A PAIN. The ride ended up being not so far, and only around $3 American. Then the top popped up, I clicked on $5 thinking it was a couple of dollars. Later my daughter figures it out and tells me that the $5 only ended being like twenty four cents. I felt so bad. UBER really needs to make a setting that you can choose what you want your miles/kilometers and currency to show. I seriously would be using it more here in Mexico, but too difficult because I can‚Äôt see what it‚Äôs really going to cost me, and clueless on how far of a distance it is.	negative
1115	368677368	travel	1	For the past months that I've been using the uber app I thought it was an okay app. Sometimes the drivers would say they're on their way in 5 minutes and then magically be 14 minutes away forcing me to cancel & search for someone else. Leaving me not being able to rate that driver & let him know what an inconvenience he has caused me. Also, normally you would be able to cancel your ride free of charge if your driver was more than 5 minutes away, today my driver was 13 minutes away, I cancelled because I was in too much of a hurry & was still charged $5. I'm extremely OVER this app, I will begin to use my local TLC driver companies from now on since they so conveniently make you comfortable ordering their vehicles and they actually give you real life people experiences even when you‚Äôve been inconvenienced. I also have had drivers lie about their vehicles that they‚Äôve been traveling in but because the license plate matched then I had to ride in that vehicle. Reaching out to Uber has become a joke because they purposefully make you feel like you‚Äôre the problem and their well within their means to do and have drivers do as they please. The support at Uber has become nonexistent and they‚Äôre prices have increased so dramatically that I should basically buy my own vehicle and pay my own gas and insurance, it would be so much cheaper. I‚Äôm just so over the issues that I‚Äôve been experiencing with Uber for months now.	positive
1116	368677368	travel	3	"Uber was so much better when they first started. Currently, at times they are worse than taxis were prior to Uber. Each app upgrade is more glitchy than the previous one. Many times I receive wrong pick up location from my home and other locations. Pickup at the Atlanta Airport are only getting worse every week. First, the passengers have to walk unreasonably long distance to the pickup location, which are poorly marked and require passengers to walk thru a very creepy garage. Then the wait times for the ride is getting longer and longer. The drivers take longer than estimated pick up time. I fly every week and the decline in service is very noticeable. Not to mention the fees keep going higher and higher. Uber is getting worse than taxis. At least with taxis I don‚Äôt have to walk unreasonably long distance and wait for the driver. One more thing, Atlanta airport installed heating lamps in the Uber pick up area, which is the most idiotic thing to do in 90 degree weather. 

Furthermore, more and more Uber drivers install obnoxious air refresheners that are overwhelming and headaches inducing. Can Uber develop air refreshener policy. Because if I cancel the ride based on smelly car then Uber will charge me cancellation fee - not fair. Taxis don‚Äôt do that. If I don‚Äôt like the quality of taxi then I don‚Äôt get in without paying fees."	negative
1117	368677368	travel	1	So I thought I‚Äôd use Uber to go pick somebody up to hang out with They were a min away from the pick up locations The person I was going to have it picked up said they went out in the car and drove off and she was chasing the car Had to call multiple times to get a hold of the drive at which the driver said he waited five minutes they never showed he‚Äôs on the phone with Uber there‚Äôs nothing he can do He said the ride is canceled that I have to make another ride The ride was $28 he said that I would be refunded the ride but have to pay a cancellation fee well two days later I find out I‚Äôm charge $77 in my account So obviously Uber is a scam a joke and fraud alll in one they stolen my money I didn‚Äôt look up on the app and they switched the drop off location to make as much money as possible they did not cancel the ride because the ride is supposedly now complete and nobody got pick up or drop off and I‚Äôve been trying to get a hold of Uber for the last six hours and there‚Äôs no way to get a hold of them I Filed a help ticket if that‚Äôs what you call it but nobody gets back it‚Äôs just copy paste copy paste copy paste anyone help me please I would highly highly recommend staying away from this company unless you want your private information stored in your bank account zeroed and make believe rides and money just been thrown away that you can‚Äôt get back	negative
1118	368677368	travel	5	"Uber is doing excellent but I think it should be cheaper. because we have to add tips for the uber drivers. after adding tips, the amount is same as a taxi would charge. And I wish Uber would allow Uber riders to choose the Uber drivers they would want rides from. that would be excellent..... I commend Uber for providing excellent service. & I can see Uber is improving all the time because I see new changes each time. I like the stop feature. that's clever, excellent. I'm
not complaining. I'm
simply giving some suggestions..... other than that, that's excellent service...... I wish there was Uber for everything. because there are people who are independent but still sort of disabled, who don't have any help from family or anyone because everybody is busy working. sometimes they need someone to do errands for them for groceries. if an Uber worker could do some groceries or miscellaneous tasks too. that would be awesome......some people don't have a car to work or lost their car temporarily. it would be nice if there was a special rate for individuals who need to get to work who can't afford a rental for two, three, four months......just like when Uber created uber eats which is very good! ü§ó"	positive
1119	368677368	travel	1	I loved Uber. Never had an issue with it until recently. I don‚Äôt know if this is happening to anyone else but now I see a wait time fee on my receipt. I understand there is a wait time charge if the Uber driver arrives and they are obviously kept waiting but recently quite often the Uber driver can be at the corner of my block stating it arrives soon and I‚Äôm waiting outside and at the end of my trip I see there is a charge for wait time. How can that be if I was ready and they weren‚Äôt even in front of the pick up location. Or I‚Äôve have a few times where the driver states it‚Äôs here but they aren‚Äôt at the correct pick up even though I put the address and they are a few buildings away and then I have to walk to them and that causes them to start charging a wait time fee. Not sure if that is their GPS issue but it‚Äôs annoying. Just the other day I requested an Uber and I was outside and the driver instead of heading straight which is where I was he drove around the block before arriving to me and then headed my way, mind you there was no traffic or others cars there for him giving him reason to go around the block. And what do you know I was charged a wait time fee. This is very frustrating and I have reached out to support which they have helped but it‚Äôs annoying to constantly be going thru support. I hate to be that type of person that always has a complaint but they need to address this issue .	negative
1120	368677368	travel	2	I‚Äôve used uber hundreds and hundreds of time and never had a problem until two months ago - now I constantly receive an error message saying ‚ÄúOOPS SOMETHING WENT WRONG‚Äù ‚Äúthere‚Äôs and error processing your request‚Äù ‚Äúplease visit in-app help for assistance.‚Äù I‚Äôve googled this and many people have the same problem to which they‚Äôve been offered no solution. For me, I trusted uber before because it was reliable. I had a major injury this year and couldn‚Äôt walk. I relied on uber for transportation which I can‚Äôt do anymore. So many times this app has left me stranded and I had to look for a bus or black cab. So many times this app left me stranded due to this error message so I was late getting to where I needed to go. Uber, you need to get this sorted. The whole point of your app is reliability and convenience. I don‚Äôt have time to do in app help which we all know is not going to fix the problem. I just need a car that will be there when I need it. How hard is that? Anyone know of a competitor app in London that I can use as a back-up in case this app fails again? One last complaint. Sometimes my app screen goes totally white and I can‚Äôt see when the driver is arriving nor do I have any of this details. So I‚Äôm waiting and will miss him and won‚Äôt be able to contact him but still get charged by you. No okay. Please fix your bugs.	negative
1121	368677368	travel	1	I have been using uber for the last four years. I don‚Äôt own a car by choice. I used to use their service all the time from shopping to going to the airport. Basically they were my chauffeur. I had no issues and everything was just great. Until about two months ago, they charged my corporate card instead of my personal card. I contacted them to change the payment method, so they charged my personal card and refunded two out of four charges. So I had two charges that were in two different card. I emailed them at least ten times to refund my corporate card or otherwise I was going to risk getting in trouble with my company. Two months later and no refunds. I emailed and emailed so many times and still no refund. I wake up one morning to an email from Uber telling me that my account is suspended due to a policy violation ( these people are a joke).i guess they did like that I emailed so many times for MY HARD EARNED MONEY. Lyft have been sending me emails to ride with them for a huge discount but I kept using Uber. I have spent so much money with Uber, you would think they will show so type of loyalty too. They did not just lose my business now, they also gave their competition a new loyal customer. I am also making sure that everyone I run into know how disloyal and rude they are. My friends, family and co-workers all switched to Lyft. One customer at the time. THANKS LYFT.	positive
1122	368677368	travel	1	"Since the ‚Äúshort walk‚Äù reform Uber had just made us customers pay the same money for lower quality services. 
UberPool makes you walk even if you don‚Äôt want to. Sometimes it gives you the option to pay almost $2 more to get a door-to-door service which makes it about the same price of getting an UberX so it loses the purpose of booking a Pool. I remember when you just initiated the new UberPool system, you told customers that it will decrease prices. What we actually got is the same prices for having to walk to get an UberPool which doesn‚Äôt bring you on time to where you need to get. Driver arrival times are misleading, destination arrival times are misleading, and us customers just keep cooperating with inflating prices while the service we actually get is worse. It would be more fair if at least we customers could now upfront that we get worse service and have the option of reaching a better decision whether we should call an UberX or a Pool. If the ETA of the driver is said to be 9 min, it cannot arrive in 20min (assuming he didn‚Äôt have any unexpected obstacles in his route) and if the ETA to your destination on a Pool is a window of 20min but it actually takes 40min to get to your destination, you should notify the rider upfront on the actual time window of arrival so he can reach a smart decision whether he wants to use the service or not. 
We want the old UberPool back and we want honest ETAs."	positive
1123	368677368	travel	2	I‚Äôm a very active Uber rider (up to 100 rides per month) for at least 5 years.  In general it‚Äôs been a good experience.  However, I see all sorts of issues with the way the app works.  I‚Äôd love to be able to provide this feedback to them in the app and help them improve and avoid several situations where they‚Äôve been unintentionally making it more difficult to use.   There is no way to contact Uber to let them know these things.  As a result there have been issues that have existed for years and create annoyance on a weekly basis.  This is not the type of customer centric experience I‚Äôd expect.   One of many examples.  When booking a ride to the Atlanta airport, the app only displays the first characters.  These are Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson... then it gets cut off before being able to select the only information that really matters - which terminal?  As a result, ever ride defaults to the international terminal.  Every passenger and every driver I‚Äôve talked with about this has experienced the same problem.  I‚Äôm sure this happens thousands of times a day.   Probably worth the minute it would take to fix this.  This App Store feedback is the only way I‚Äôve found to actually communicate this to Uber.  That‚Äôs just scratching the surface.  My suggestion is that Uber actually figure out a way to pay attention to and act on their customers suggestion.	positive
1124	368677368	travel	3	I use uber almost every single day and I spend lot of money on it. Why? Because I thought it was the most convenient and reliable choice out there. But I guess I was mistaken. I‚Äôve had lot of great experiences with them and to be honest, they have been very quick at resolving my issues. However, last week, I just received an email from them saying that they were investigating a report from one of my recent rides, so my account would be on hold in the meantime. I wrote them three times to ask what was going on and why I was being investigated, but I never heard back from them and usually they are very quick at responding to emails. I just think this is very unprofessional on their part as they should be able to give the reasons why they decide to put my account on hold. But it‚Äôs not fair on my end because I might be accused of something I did not do at all because I use UberPool most of the time. So a driver might report under my name, something that a different rider did because they don‚Äôt know who is who most of the time. I don‚Äôt mind the investigation, but at least tell me why before you put my account on hold. This is just very disrespectful and I guess after this, I will never use uber again and you just lost a very loyal customer.	positive
1125	368677368	travel	1	"Yeah, they get you from point A to point B, but it‚Äôs not really worth it they let practically anyone drive half the time the drivers cars are either really small and smell or the driver doesn‚Äôt speak English enough to communicate with you... since I live in the city of Las Vegas any time any major event is going on they surge the prices through the roof... plus on top of all of their flaws I‚Äôve had some of the worst customer service lol 

There‚Äôs no actual people to talk to if there‚Äôs a problem everything‚Äôs all done through the app. I‚Äôve had an uber driver pick me up and he was drinking with an open container in his car and after I reported him to the police then uber, uber refunded me for my $5 car ride and said sorry... nothing more which I found ridiculous! And if you leave an item in an uber on accident apparently uber doesn‚Äôt care. Lol I called the driver and asked him if I left it and he said yeah and I asked how to get it back and he told me to call someone who cares and hung up then blocked my number then after I filed a complaint with uber they said they weren‚Äôt responsible for lost items since drivers are contractors, like you‚Äôre joking me right? 
 
In my opinion uber should have done more of an investigation into the lost item and maybe even ban the driver from driving and same goes for the one who thought it was okay to drink and drive and work... Honestly I would never use uber again if I didn‚Äôt have to!"	negative
1126	368677368	travel	4	"Uber is not a bad service, but I think the rating system needs to be done away with, or at least used more judiciously, for a number of reasons. The judgement of the drivers (as well as the quality of their service) can sometimes be hit or miss. For example, I had a driver yell at me for asking him to lower the radio. Nine times out of ten co-riders couldn't care less so I figured it was ok to ask him. After passive-aggressively avoiding my request this guy goes on a tirade on how he leaves it on for the customers and how it's his therapy or something like that. 

It's frustrating for me to see my rating go down on account of driver's who report anonymously. If my performance as a passenger really was such a big deal, drivers can just report me and take it up with management, but as it stands, there is no clear criteria as to what constitutes good ""5 star"" conduct. I do my utmost to be on time, courteous, and forgiving towards drivers who give less than a professional performance. The fact that there are drivers out there who can't reciprocate and who go out of their way to rate me lower just goes to show, as far as my judgement is concerned, that the drivers on this app need to be held more accountable to their customers and their employers."	positive
1127	368677368	travel	4	NYC drivers with lower than a 4.7 rating should be placed on temporary probation. Drivers with lower than average ratings are a risk to the company profit too. I‚Äôve been treated rudely, ignored, and basically told by some drivers, they dont want to follow the customer recommendations or request navigation route.. With all the cultural differences in drivers, some drivers don‚Äôt want to listen to women & I honestly don‚Äôt want to get in a car with a driver with low ratings. Please ask drivers to maintain clean cars, I shouldn‚Äôt have to sit on another mans trash. Please ask drivers to ask customer if AIR conditioning and no music/music is ok. One driver didn‚Äôt one to turn on music for a 45min ride, I was losing my mind in the awkward silence. All Uber drivers should have iPhone chargers for customers. Uber drivers should not stare down women in the rear view mirrors, or turn ALL the way around while driving to flirt with customers‚Äî there simply should be some company rules for workplace harassment inside the Uber car. There should be a feature in the Uber App that allows customers to indicate if / when they are rushing to a destination, so drivers can know in advance if they need to drive more strategically around traffic or drive a little faster within the speed limits.	negative
1128	368677368	travel	4	I use Uber almost every day and find it a huge help in getting me places I can‚Äôt during a hand injury, which makes driving tough. That being said, perhaps Uber can provide some guidance to drivers to not start a ride before the passenger gets to the car (I have had a frequent increase in drivers starting the ride when they arrive even if I‚Äôm still walking outside from my building or stuck in an elevator for an extra minute). This is tricky because the app stresses checking the license plate before getting in the car, but if the ride has started, then I can‚Äôt confirm the make/model of the car and the license plate. As a single woman hoping into stranger‚Äôs cars, I like being able to confirm that I‚Äôm riding with the right person before entering their car. Could you please provide guidance to drivers not to start a ride before the person gets in the car (ideal option) or add car info so that it is easily accessible once a ride has started so that if they do, I can still confirm I‚Äôm in the right car (back-up option)? It would definitely make me feel better being able to confirm, especially now that the app pushes confirmation of license plates so much.	positive

After dropping me off at my home I realized I had left my cell phone along with my credit cards in his vehicle! Right away I asked my wife to call my phone and ‚ÄúEver‚Äù promptly answered. He knew the reason why my phone was ringing off the hook and he answered. He was not very far from my location and imidiatley returned the phone and wallet back to me. I am so appreciative to him and the person that informed him of the possible lost phone in his back seat. So not only do I want to thank Ever but also the person the informed him of a lost phone and wallet tonight. THANK YOU UBER, THANK YOU ‚ÄúEVER‚Äù and thank you to the person who actually informed my driver that someone had left their phone and wallet behind. It‚Äôs hard to find more honest people now a days and when you find people like this it gives you hope and makes you recognize that there are still very good and honest people still in this world!

1130	368677368	travel	5	I too, was sold on the idea of cost effective ride sharing. Until these past two years Uber has been in the news media almost daily, of a sexual assault, or involvement. Beyond that, I was an uber driver that got approved to drive in the Flagstaff market June 2016, while Lyft denied me. After 4700, trips and a high rating of 4.96(5 is the highest) I got waitlisted after Checkr decided to consider the charge that was there in my background when I first got approved. Having said that, my hopes of the future with uber, is out. As well, support, and praising their company. It is simply a get rich scheme they tried on us general population that‚Äôs costing them millions of dollars due to lawsuits, not really being covered by their ride share insurance while technically it‚Äôs illegal for us drivers to use our vehicles without our own commercial insurance. In addition, it‚Äôs illegal to use a personal vehicle for business use under a financial loan. If they find out, just like your insurance provider, you will not be covered and held responsible for violation. Please, general population, do not use uber because technically you‚Äôre not covered if something happens.	positive
1131	368677368	travel	1	I used Uber Jan 12 after returning from a trip. Coming to Atlanta can be hectic by itself due to constant construction and changes. Needless to say I use Uber when returning home. Not anymore. They moved the pickup area!!!!  It was raining and cold. I had gone to the original pickup sight to catch my ride. The pickup area had changed. Now I‚Äôm running with my bags and other things in the cold and rain trying to get to the new spot. I‚Äôm letting the driver know I wasn‚Äôt aware the location had changed and I was on my way to the new location and would arrive very shortly. I received a notification my driver had cancelled my ride. I got to the new location right after receiving the notice. VERY UPSET, TIRED AND WET. He chose to cancel me and pickup someone already there. Well here‚Äôs the devastation. I had to request another driver to get home. So now I‚Äôm paying the actual driver who took me home and discovered I‚Äôm paying the driver who cancelled me as well.  TWO CHARGES. That‚Äôs ridiculous when I was Minutes away. As for the driver it is easy to pickup someone standing there knowing you‚Äôre going to get compensated for both. A charge from me plus a charge plus tip from the driver you pickup. Not happy with Uber. Will look into LYFT‚Äôs customer service rules and driver ethics. If you didn‚Äôt know this now you do. Uber can cancel a customer, charge a fee for the driver and leave you having to start the process over again and pay again.	negative

The Uber app itself was very easy to use, the fares were very reasonable and the drivers were very friendly and understanding (for the most part). Unfortunately, although Uber was my go to ridesharing app, there became a time when I was charged a different amount for a trip in which I had paid the amount fully beforehand (the fare was shown and I agreed to pay with my personal debit card). I was shown a price upfront of $7 and later I received a notification from my bank that I was charged $33 from Uber in which I was very confused and a bit fustrated. I tried reaching out to Uber Support upon their app, but it was a painful experience. The messaging system itself is automated so I received the same response over and over without much help. It asked me to pay the ‚ÄúOutstanding Balance‚Äù on my account in which I did, first using a relatives card and later my girlfriends. Yet even then, my account still read ‚Äúoutstanding balance‚Äù and BOTH my girlfriend and relative were charged the $30 with my account still being blocked. I then decided to simply delete the app but Uber did not allow me to delete it. I now cannot use the Uber app and I am completely blocked away. Support was absolutely terrible, they stole my money and honestly did not help at all.	negative

However, the maybe five times I have used to I have encountered several drivers who just don‚Äôt seem capable of doing the job and the customer service always seems to want to place blame on your somehow. A few incidents I recall quite well was one where a driver drove past my location and to the destination without ever picking me up and then reported the job as completed. Another when the driver cancelled the drive mid route when he hit traffic , and then the support teams response was ‚Äú If a trip is cancelled for any reason you still must pay the cancellation fee‚Äù and after that debacle and arguing they eventually refunded me, and lastly was when I had a flat and parked and ordered an Uber to come pick me up - my driver only spoke Spanish and was driving around my location but not getting to it. I sent her a description of my location to help which she presumably could not read because she responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here‚Äù in Spanish after opening the messages and being no where near the mapped location. Then I responded to her the same description but in Spanish ,which she read, and then promptly cancelled the ride. Then I had to fight with customer service for a full refund. This app and its drivers are more of a hassle than it‚Äôs worth.	negative
1134	368677368	travel	1	"Dear Uber,
I am really annoyed by the services you had given me. When i called for a ride (like this one) you made me wait for my driver for 8 minutes, then you kick off my driver (when he is just 1-2 mins away) and give me a new driver which i had to wait again for another 7 mins! That was past 11pm and i was waiting in the dark, cold and agitated! These didn‚Äôt just happened once! Most of the time it‚Äôs when i am in a rush. One time you gave me 3 drivers (kicking off the first two) that made me wait for more than 30 minutes to finally picked me up. The thing is, you kick off my previous driver after you made me wait that long and he is just a minute away. And you didn‚Äôt even compensate my wasted time and no promotions at least to compensate me. You only gave $2 compensation when the driver arrives late (from your estimated ETA) at the destination. I am going to work. What excuse do i give my boss? That the Uber app is unreliable? And does the $2 compensate for the late arrival excuse at work? No! Why can‚Äôt you do your job properly? And why don‚Äôt you list all the supposed to be driver that you kicked off at my history so that there‚Äôs a better track and explain why you kicked them off? obviously that driver didn‚Äôt cancel me coz he is just a minute away to get me! You are useless and unreliable! Very bad service!

And I had no way to get up to the hospital and back or for that matter to go anywhere that I needed to go. I had no other options available to me no one to drive me places I needed to go but my daughter had set me up with Uber and I have all the independence and mobility I need with just a touch my phone. My license is not that important anymore in fact Uber is even easier than driving I will be able to get into a warm car in the winter and a cool car in the summer and I am no longer worried about needing to go somewhere and not being able to drive. Uber has been a lifesaver for me literally and has given me total independence from having to depend on anyone else me and my wife will be using Uber a lot in the future and and the price is extremely reasonable I don‚Äôt write these things very often in fact I don‚Äôt remember ever writing a review but Uber has provided me independence to go anywhere or do anything without having to pay car insurance or car repairs or car payments. I am so grateful for Uber.	positive
1136	368677368	travel	1	I received a gift card for $20 and shared a ride with my sister 2 times. The first time the gift card paid for my half and the second time the gift card should have paid for my half and then another payment method cover the remainder. On the second ride, my sister (who had also received a $20 gift card) was able to use what was left of her gift card balance and her backup payment method was charged the remainder. My backup method paid the entire trip and my gift card balance was not used. When I submitted a request for Uber to look into this, I was told that you have to purchase more Uber cash to use the remainder of the gift card. This would not be a big deal if my sister - who in the exact same situation - would have had to have purchased Uber cash to use hers. Obviously this is a lie since it worked for her. I was then told that due to my issue my gift card balance would be refunded to me and to provide a mailing address. After a month had passed I followed up on this and was told that I cannot get a refund for my gift card and the prior employee had lied. Now, I am being told the same story that you have to purchase Uber cash to use a partial gift card which is back to the same lie I was told in the beginning and can prove wrong based on my sister‚Äôs half of our shared receipt. This company has no idea what they‚Äôre doing and can‚Äôt keep their lies straight.	positive
1137	368677368	travel	1	I recently took an uber pool. The route was all over the place but I never complain because you get what you pay for: crap service. Toward what should have been the end of my ride, we picked up another rider. The GPS was directing the driver to drop off the other rider first, which would mean going past my stop. After having been in the car for about 40 minutes (usually 25 by pool at most) I was ready to get out, so I asked the driver to stop and let me out. The driver ignored me and kept driving. He headed further away from my stop, so I sat there stunned that he didn't let me out and not wanting to get dropped off even farther from my house. He went past the other rider's stop and had to get turned around to drop me off. I told the driver exactly where to stop and he went past it. I said just stop here and his car kept moving, so I yelled, let me out! Stop the car. He stopped and I got out. I wrote to customer support and their response had nothing to do with the fact that I felt unsafe but rather the perils of taking pool. I thought it was a joke. They explained my fare would not be adjusted. It's not about the fare! Let people out of the car when they want to get out! I will not being using uber anymore. I felt trapped and uncomfortable. My genuine concern was met with an automated response. Glad to know nothing about uber had changed. The safety of their riders is not a priority.	negative
1138	368677368	travel	3	I want to say that I have only had one major issue with Uber as a rider and I personally like Uber. However, I still think you need to improve the service. First, the location feature for the rider is subpar to me. I use Uber a lot to drive my to college and I have to put in a specific address just to have my drive take me to the part of the school I need the drive drop me off. It would be a lot easier to have a satellite view of the map give the drive an exact location of my destination. Second ,you are now starting to charge all these ludicrous fees such as the waiting fee if my driver has to wait more than two minutes at my pickup location. I understand that having to make the driver wait on me when I sometimes have to get ready when I should have done that before the driver arrived at my location is rude, but Lyft doesn't charge me a waiting fee. Third, I do not like the rating system. The idea that giving anything less than five starts automatically assumes that the driver did something wrong. If I give a driver a four star rating you assume that the driver must have done something. When I give a driver a four star rating I am telling the driver that I enjoyed the drive. I do not imply that I had a horrible experience with an Uber rider.	negative
1139	368677368	travel	3	"Okay this has happen to me about 4 times now, why am I waiting a whole 10-30 mins for a driver to leave the same area they at?

I‚Äôve been waiting and waiting and waiting that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm trynna cancel, and the driver is still in the same spot but I might end up being charged because I ordered an Uber but they taking they time to get here and so I‚Äôm canceling the Uber. I might be charged for that reason. WOW!

Also this is an issue for me as well I don‚Äôt know why but recently after having a ride I get out the car to tip the drive and then I get a notification from my bank saying refunded, I didn‚Äôt cancel my ride so why am I getting my money back and they‚Äôre just wasting time on me, I mean don‚Äôt get me wrong I love the free rides and all but I don‚Äôt want to cheat them off their hard worked money, they earned it so I want them to have it, and yes this happened today this morning, so get this fix or I‚Äôm gonna keep up with these bad report on bad y‚Äôall treating your drivers..."	negative
1140	368677368	travel	2	"I‚Äôve tried to use Uber three times. First at home in a slightly rural area. There were no Uber drivers available and I had to use a conventional cab. No ride no stars. The second time traveling in Brisbane Australia from a residence to the Brisbane Transit Center in downtown Brisbane. Uber worked great. Five stars for this ride to the public transportation center of the city. 
When we arrived back at the Brisbane Transit Center three day later and needing a ride to the residence, we again contacted Uber. We described where were, under a very large sign stating Brisbane Transportation Center including it‚Äôs street address. We got a text from our driver to verify location, and we agin texted our location, address, and location under the very large sign at the entrance to the transit center. Three days earlier we had been dropped off about 30 meters from where we stood on the same side of the same street by the first Uber driver. The potential driver responded with a thumbs up. The app indicated he was less than a minute away. He called a moment later and my wife again explained to the driver our location. My wife said he was difficult to understand. After about 15 minutes of waiting we got the Uber cancellation notice. We called someone else (not Uber) who spoke English and new exactly where we were. Five stars to someone besides Uber."	positive
1141	368677368	travel	3	As a driver for uber, i constantly hear from passengers how difficult it is to see what kind of vehicle is picking them up. I have used the passenger app myself and i can attest to the fact that the color and picture of the vehicle along with the license plate are so miniaturized that they are difficult to see. Not to mention people with visual disabilities and color blindness will find it even harder to know what color car is picking them up. I‚Äôve had new users show me the app and i have had to explain to them how to navigate and see the driver‚Äôs details including type and color of the car. From a passenger‚Äôs stand point, it would be most helpful the screen is divided into rows; right side for the map and left side for the name, vehicle type, color and license plate or vice versa in block letters for easy visibility. Also it needs to say what color instead of showing the color. For passenger‚Äôs whose phone battery is running low while they wait for the driver to show up, the constant use of location service which is a battery killer should be changed to maybe every 1 minute for example if the driver is 7 minutes away from being constant. This will help the passenger as well as the driver as it will post the most accurate and recently updated location.	negative

‚Äî-
I am a user and a driver. When it works it works pretty well on both ends. When it doesn't, it fails in spectacular ways; stranding you at airports because you trusted it to work and made no back up plan for your 11:00pm arrival and subsequent 1 hour of troubleshooting the app. To make it worse, support is U. S. E. L. E. S. S. For some reason every response is from a different person who has zero access to previous communication. Last night I picked up a rider, the app crashed on pick up. The rider had to verbally direct me. Then I spent five minutes fixing the app. Now support is 7 emails deep even though I literally told them everything, sent screen shots proving the ride (a habit I am now in because of the app). It should have been a $4 ride for the user and $3 for me but they charged the user $0, then $13, and now $5 in 24 hours because they can't read the details I've sent now three times (pick up, drop off, time, miles and even did all the math for them). All this gets them 25% of your rides. Like I said, when it works... it is the future. When it doesn't, it makes you kick a puppy."	positive
1143	368677368	travel	1	I love the idea of ride share like Uber or Lyft. Sometimes it‚Äôs way more affordable than cabs. However, I have not had a good experience with Uber. Over two years ago I was in NYC and was waiting for the driver forever who never came so I had to cancel the ride and wait for another driver. Got charged some fees which after some digging for customer service (since they make it so inaccessible) I was refunded in the form of store credit. Well years go by I try to log in to my account and it asks me for the first six digits of my card and there is no way to overcome that step to log in. My card expired years ago! Was I supposed to hold on to it? Anyway, now I‚Äôm unable to log in to my account and when i send the message to them it asks me to verify my email by clicking on the link sent to my email otherwise they won‚Äôt process my request. Cool. Well when I click on the link the server is down so I cannot verify my email so my messages to support aren‚Äôt going through. I cannot log in to my account or create a new one because it is the same phone number and there is no phone number  to contact them. Thank god there is Lyft. Even though it is a little pricier than Uber, I guess you get what you paid for. Honestly, Uber was cool when it was the only app , now there are so many alternatives so if I were you , go with a better alternative. Uber went downhill :/	positive
1144	368677368	travel	5	After studying for my Multivariable Calculus exam at an apartment near my college campus until 2 am, I called an Uber to go back to my dorm room. Uber informed me that the ride was 2 minutes away, but after waiting 10 minutes, the app had only gone up 6 minutes to a total of 8 minutes away. This compelled me to contact the driver, who was extraordinarily rude. This uber was extraordinarily unprofessional, had more than one of her own friends in the car, and talked to me in a condescending way when asking if she was alright and would prefer for me to find another ride. She then continued to drive away and lengthen the time of pickup after responding to me ‚Äúwe good you‚Äôll be straight‚Äù after asking if she was okay and whether she‚Äôd prefer me to calm another ride. Because of the unfriendly system of the uber app, I was never able to contact the company in order to report the driver, while it was a major annoyance for me, it wasn‚Äôt the end of the world. But I want to report this driver for being unprofessional and Uber does not give the opportunity to do that, the app does not support the customers or even try to. Use lift whenever you can.	negative

1146	368677368	travel	3	I take uber at least 3-5 times a week to get to work and for the past 5 months, everything has been great until yesterday. I took an uber pool and I rarely check the uber app after getting into the car. We picked up another passenger and I got to my destination no problem. But then I got a notification from my uber app saying the driver has cancelled which makes no sense since I already arrived at my destination. But according to the app, apparently the driver never started the trip. Which makes me wonder how she knew to pick up the other passenger. But that‚Äôs not my problem, my problem is that it is the driver‚Äôs fault for not starting the trip. Yet somehow, I got charged for $15: $5 for cancellation and $10 for the trip. Which is just unbelievable, this was an uber pool, so the price was shown to me before I booked it and it was $8 not $10 and I can‚Äôt even get started on the cancellation fee because I never cancelled the trip. And how about the driver picking up another person despite not starting my trip? She was possibly driving for uber and lyft at the same time. And when I try to click on ‚Äúreview my cancellation fee‚Äù it says I can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs already been reviewed. I am just beyond livid. I want my money back, uber, this is unacceptable	negative
1147	368677368	travel	1	Most of the times when I request a Uber the driver never shows up then they usually call me to tell me to cancel the ride if a customer cancels a ride Uber charges you for the ride regardless so that is the new way for these drivers to rip people off I spent a whole hour plenty of times trying to get a cab through Uber definitely won‚Äôt be using this app anymore and switching over to lyft or Juno the other day a driver refused to let me in the vehicle for no reason whatsoever pretty sure it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm colored and he picked me up in a industrial area I was just getting off work once he saw me standing there he locked the doors as I was walking to the car then drove off Uber still charged me for the ride even though I never entered the vehicle when I reported it to Uber all they did was give me $5 credit on a $13 ride also most of the Uber drivers don‚Äôt even know the areas they drive unlike a yellow cab in nyc you won‚Äôt deal with them not knowing a area majority of Uber drivers in nyc don‚Äôt speak English and don‚Äôt pay attention to the signs or the roads Uber is a highly disappointing app I recommend all first time customers you are better off using lyft or Juno I have the worst experiences always with those Maniac Uber‚Äôs constantly texting and getting into car accidents it‚Äôs ridiculous my Uber rating is 4.94 yet I‚Äôm always getting bad drivers	negative
1148	368677368	travel	2	"The Uber driver that picked-up my trip had an estimated time of 6 minutes and the main reason for me to request a cab was because I was running out of time and the driver didnt arrive on time but in 12 minutes. That is a huge difference for a wait time. If I had cancel the trip because my driver was taking longer than I would have been charge a fee. How is that fair? On top of this, I had to change my destination so a re-arrange the new address but, the driver took twice the time which charged me an exaggerated amount for a faster drive. Why does it happens like this if besides taking long for it to arrive for pick-up and longer time for the trip I get charged more!! That is no help at all!! Not convenient at all!!! Uber has to be more conscious on the availability of cancellation of a trip if driver is taking longer!!!!! 
So, as well as there are benefits from using Uber there are some inconveniences. The most outstanding one I will say that is the estimated arrival for a pick-up. The app should not allow drivers to pick-up a trip of more than 5 minutes or even just 5 because it usually takes at least that or more. That is a waste of time as a customer since one of the main reasons we might be using this service is because we are in a rush, so we don‚Äôt have that time."	positive
1149	368677368	travel	2	I take uber a lot to get to and from work, now I don‚Äôt even like using it as much anymore. It‚Äôs gotten more expensive for me. I can‚Äôt even afford it anymore. Lyft definitely has the more competitive option. Plus it is a lot easier to get in touch with a customer representative when I have issues. I always have to argue through emails with Uber because it seems like none of their reps know what they are looking at or understanding half the time. It‚Äôs such a pain to deal with. Why make it more difficult for users? It‚Äôs even worse when the app glitches. From did the driver even start the ride to I had to cancel the trip just for it to end the actual trip. Then the times where the app wasn‚Äôt working at all. Period. Oh, don‚Äôt let me forget about the drivers I‚Äôve gotten as well. Made me question as to whether Uber will take just anyone as a driver. I‚Äôve been harassed and money stolen off of trips and have reported it NUMEROUS TIMES,  but that seems to not get me anywhere. 2 stars. Financially crippling for those who have to take uber, but no longer can afford it for work. Awful customer service, especially when you need to get things done, response time is the worst. App glitches, OFTEN. No point on constantly updating when it doesn‚Äôt even change. Drivers that shouldn‚Äôt even be exposed to people.	negative
1150	1344700142	games	3	"This game is a fun time waster but its completely random in terms of winning or loosing. You'll have a day where you'll win 9/10 games then you'll have a day where you'll loose 9/10 games and often time all your coins, this is my 2nd day in a row where my loose ratio well exceeds my wins ( like 15 losses and 5 wins) and now I'm loosing interest in playing. There really isn't much strategy involved, you play what ever cards are given so you‚Äôre pretty much bound to completely win or loose (i guess thats ‚Äúcards‚Äù though lol..). I often times play with a teammate because i feel that you would have more chances of winning (50/50) but that doesn't seem to be the case as iv been loosing consecutive games..I will also add as I've seen in someone else‚Äôs comments, I feel that the +4 card is a scam because 9 times out of 10 you'll loose the guess..Don't hate the game for it, idk im sure its legit but it just seems odd to loose so many guesses. However, I will say that the +4 card seems to be the most strategic card to use as in you can either set you or your teammate up for a good play or call a bluff color to throw your opponents off.

My biggest dislike is how you get skipped when you get hit with the +2 or +4 card! Thats insult to injury! As if getting multiple cards isn't bad enough, then you dont even get to play your hand. Not cool. 

Overall 3 out of 5 stars, its fun but gets stale on those days where you cant break out of a loose streak."	positive
1151	1344700142	games	3	This version of UNO is the best out there; however, the +4 mechanic where you have to guess is terrible! Sure, I understand that it is meant to add to the unpredictability of the game, and that would be fine, if it was not for the fact that you guessing ALWAYS results in you receiving a penalty. Let me explain this: let‚Äôs say the player who goes before you has two cards‚Äîa +4 and a yellow card (for the sake of the example). Then say that the player who goes before you puts down the said +4 card and changes it to yellow, the color corresponding to their last card. Now it asks me if I think that the player before me has some other random color, so I say no. Obviously the player who goes before me has a yellow card, that is why they changed the color. So I press ‚Äúno‚Äù and I have to draw four cards for guessing wrong. Most of the times I think that they really did not have a yellow card until the person who goes before me puts down a yellow and wins the game. I have lost MANY games because of this. Why do I have to draw four cards when I correctly guessed that the player before me had no cards of a certain color. Now I have to say that this is not always the case, although, it has happened plenty of times for me to have to write a review about this game. Please fix the way the +4 cards work in the game of just remove the mechanic all together.	positive
1152	1344700142	games	1	In a real game of Uno it‚Äôs highly unlikely to draw 3 +4‚Äôs on your first turn but in this app that seems to happen every other game.  Players can also buy power ups with real money or in-game money that give you an unfair advantage over the other players.  It‚Äôs also incredibly easy to lose all of your coins in a couple games.  You can‚Äôt even play the game anymore if you lose all your money because all of the matches have entry fees. The only way to get it back is to go on the next day and receive 300 coins which is barely enough for one match, if you then lose that match you have to wait another day.  Another mechanic that is not like real Uno is the plus 4 system.  Instead of the normal next person pickup 4 cards they can ‚Äúchallenge you‚Äù which means if they think you had a card that was the color of the card before it was changed they can say yes. If you did have that than instead of them picking up cards you have to draw 4. What I found most annoying about this is it can stop you from stacking draw 4s and force you to draw when you could have stacked. There is also a timer in the game and when it goes out instead of the person with the most cards winning the person with the most points wins.  You gain points by playing cards like wilds and skips.  So you could have one card left about to play it, if the timer runs out you could easily lose the game.  Please take these factors into consideration before buying this game.	positive

Because we were playing and lost so much coins so this would be a big change and also I really like this game so it would help if you would can add that update so I can play more games and I play a lot with friends and family but Lose coins and need to get more and this would be a way faster way because the gum ball machine helps but it‚Äôs hard to do because it only has six tries to do and I think it would help if friends can or could send coins so that when ever you run out of coin‚Äôs you can be able to play because you can count on your friends and or family.

Again I really like and love this game so much I play it 24/7 and just thought of that idea and was like hey let me right a review and I just really hope you would see this and at least think about it because it would be really helpful!

And I‚Äôm not the mean spirited that boos or throws eggs at people for giving me draw twos or draw fours. I realize it‚Äôs in there hand to play to try and win. Reasonable. However, all of the sudden I noticed the game was doing EVIL glitches. Example, I‚Äôd already have a duck hand to start with, hang in there, play my hand WELL, put my only draw 2  and it would GIVE ME BACK MY DRAW TWO TO MYSELF. It would happen with various plays to get ahead. Then, I started getting a player say KARMA!!! And I‚Äôm thinking, what the heck I rescue animals, nurse, and I will have players give me back draw 2‚Äôs etc that I FAIRLY played. I feel like even though I absolutely love uno and it keeps me from being lonely or occupied after working long hours at work and stuff...I have NO CHOICE but to DELETE it. It‚Äôs my only guess that it‚Äôs either TWO opinions: Your game has hackers on it that manipulate the games or it‚Äôs your own staff wanting people to purchase crap. Or both. I don‚Äôt know. But one player I had on the teams...even they said ‚ÄúWhy???‚Äù After we have our opposing team draw 2 and skip and it gave it to US....then they WON. Makes no sense. But major hackville or staffville.‚Äù	positive
1155	1344700142	games	2	"As I‚Äôve seen from other reviews on this game, it is a simple, fun, ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù time waster right? At first when I started playing, I actually enjoyed the game, I was winning every other game and had an easy flow of coinage coming from it. That was until I lost consecutive games and I kept getting put with teammates that either were afk or just didn‚Äôt do anything at all. But when they got onto their third strike they would all of a sudden want to play the game again, it‚Äôs ridiculous. I also don‚Äôt seem to under stand the function of the vip effects. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they are a nice addition to the gameplay but why do they take so long? 

I also can‚Äôt seem to wrap my mind around how we are supposed to get out coins back after loosing almost all of them. I genuinely feel like I‚Äôve just wasted my time playing the game (probably the point) at that point. It just frustrates me when I loose all of my coins and then the game has the nerve to shove an ad in my face just to earn a ticket scratch that has a chance of giving me coins that I will just loose in the next game. If I‚Äôm playing the game, I need to feel relaxed, I don‚Äôt need to feel like my life is at stake. The other alternatives to earning coins are too difficult, so you just end up spending real money on it just to play that ONE game that you have the possibility of loosing.

1156	1344700142	games	2	This version of UNO is the best out there; however, the +4 mechanic where you have to guess is terrible! Sure, I understand that it is meant to add to the unpredictability of the game, and that would be fine, if it was not for the fact that you guessing ALWAYS results in you receiving a penalty. Let me explain this: let‚Äôs say the player who goes before you has two cards‚Äîa +4 and a yellow card (for the sake of the example). Then say that the player who goes before you puts down the said +4 card and changes it to yellow, the color corresponding to their last card. Now it asks me if I think that the player before me has some other random color, so I say no. Obviously the player who goes before me has a yellow card, that is why they changed the color. So I press ‚Äúno‚Äù and I have to draw four cards for guessing wrong. Most of the times I think that they really did not have a yellow card until the person who goes before me puts down a yellow and wins the game. I have lost MANY games because of this. Why do I have to draw four cards when I correctly guessed that the player before me had no cards of a certain color. Now I have to say that this is not always the case, although, it has happened plenty of times for me to have to write a review about this game. Please fix the way the +4 cards work in the game of just remove the mechanic all together.	positive
1157	1344700142	games	4	"I love this game! I‚Äôve been playing it everyday since I downloaded it, some time last year. I‚Äôve been playing this classic card game since I were a child, so when I saw it in the App Store, I jumped on it. However, I do have two issues for me. 

1) I think the coin ratio needs to be fixed. It‚Äôs already bad enough that it seems like you lose more games than you win, but when you lose games, it seems like you lose A LOT more coins than when you win a game. For example, today, I was playing 2-on-2 in Wild Weekend(x2), I lost my first six games before I finally won about three. In each lost game, I lost no less than 500 coins, and I, nor my teammate, had a bunch of power cards, but in the games I won, I‚Äôd only win about 200 coins, and the other team would have an abundance of cards. It‚Äôs very hard to continue playing, if you‚Äôre constantly losing coins faster than you‚Äôre keeping them.

2) I feel like there should be a better way to communicate with your teammates and people on your friends list, other than the little programmed phrases. What‚Äôs the point of having teammates and friends, if you can‚Äôt communicate with them. I think that would make the gaming experience better."	positive
1158	1344700142	games	1	This game has more than a few issues that all equate to the extortion of your actual money to buy virtual coins that you end up losing faster than you win. An example: You need 100 coins to play a single player UNO Classic game, yet the match fee is only 30 coins. This means that if you have 99 coins, you can‚Äôt play. The math for winning and losing coins is clearly suspect. As an example: A first win in a UNO Classic game gives you 70 coins, but part of that 70 coins is the 30 coins that you were charged as a match fee. Your actual winnings equal only 40 coins. I have only been able to win 3 times in a row giving me a maximum of 112 coins (actually 82 coins plus the 30 coin match fee.) If you lose, the amount of coins you lose is equal to your point total plus your 30 coin match fee. An example: You had a point total of 50 when you lost the game. In actuality, you lost 80 coins. One loss can actually set you back more in coins than the coins you would win in one game. Multiple loses eat away significantly at your coin supply very quickly. Add in that the game only allows you 600 coins a day (300 2x) and win up to 200 coins on a gold scratch card or up to 100 coins if you are lucky enough (most cards give 20 to 50 coin each) with really no other way to get coins other than to purchase them with actual money. It‚Äôs extortion, especially when the developers purposefully made the game this way.	positive
1159	1344700142	games	1	WATCH OUT WARNING!!!üõëüõëüõë. Mattel is greedy as they can get at this point. üí∞üí∞üí∞ some reviews even mention that the game will randomly take coins. It is beyond rigged!!ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨When you first start, you will win with decent even great cards but ***BEWARE. It‚Äôs only a lure. ***After a little bit the game will give you horrible cards-game after game  ( for days at a time) and hardly ever give you decent playable cards making you give up your coins like it‚Äôs Las Vegas and you‚Äôre drunk as hell (The house always wins) The game is set up with a ridiculous 3 minute timer where players are forced to dump cards on other players by stacking lest the cards be stacked on them resulting in a huge loss of coins but hey if you don‚Äôt like that just pay Mattel some money üí∞ üí∞üí∞that it ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äôs so much. Sure you will see an option to use a **one time use **room key üóùto play without a timer but you have to play forever to get these godforsaken ** one use **room keys. Then there are shields which you ***can‚Äôt keep** but you can purchase just like room keys (hmm of course -GREEEED!) there many other ways to make money off the app. I would even pay for the app itself but this is extortion. Look around: Are you gonna pass my feedback to the developers Mattel? That‚Äôs rich. I bet they won‚Äôt even respond or they will lie and say what I am saying isn‚Äôt true. Go ahead read the reviews see for yourself.	positive
1160	1344700142	games	3	"First let me start this by saying I LOVE this game. I play every day even for a few minutes at a time but it‚Äôs super fun! It‚Äôs the same uno we all know, with both rule sets everyone plays (no stacks, and stacking allowed) with nice graphics and a smoothly functioning app. It has ads but most are avoidable if you don‚Äôt want to watch them purposely for the little gym ball machine (it gives you little bonus coins, gems, etc). But that brings me to my problem. Coins can be very scarce to the point where the game feels like it‚Äôs directing you to BUY coins and gems. Every log in? Pop up for the newest store sale with 2-3 more to follow, coins run dry and the only way to get more is to buy them, seeing as how the amount of coins you can send to friends is TEN per day, and the gumball machine will usually give you a chance to gain another 600 coins but if you play classic thats a maximum of 3 games if you don‚Äôt win. Gave it 3 stars but would be an EASY 5 star from me if:

- Raised the amount of coins sent/received to 100. 
- either lower coin cost for games, raise winnings from games without increasing losses to players purse (make multiplayers bonus coins instead of taking from opponents so that they only lose the required coin ante for playing whichever game mode)"	positive
1161	1344700142	games	3	This game is really fun and designed well. However I personally think it‚Äôs set up to cause you to begin loosing games regularly if you don‚Äôt spend cash money frequently enough. You earn coins by winning games. You have to pay coins in order to play. The game is so fun you want to keep playing. So this game seems to put you in positions where you lose large sums of your coins in a quick amount of time in order to get you to buy coins. Otherwise after a couple of games you may not be able to play within the app until the next day when you get free coins again. Free coins are given twice daily. However you can lose those coins in no time at all or in a game or two. Although this game allows you to win sometimes. I noticed if you won‚Äôt pay cash you end up winning small amounts that won‚Äôt sustain a long playing time or you flat out lose continuously. I‚Äôm all for paying for games that you love but this game is set up kind of scary because it reminds me of a gambling scenario. You can easily spend $4-$10 and lose it all within an hour or hours by losing a few random uno games and this is daily. I think the game needs more ways to obtain free coins regularly and offer other perks that can be bought.	positive
1162	1344700142	games	1	"This game used to be great. Sometimes you like to unwind with a good game. This used to be a good one. Then is became apparent that unless you became a VIP member, you would be punished for not paying actual money, meaning: If you lost all your coins, you simply couldn‚Äôt play the game for a few days because there is no way to replenish them unless you pay actual money. Don‚Äôt give in! For those of us who paid money to be a ‚Äúvip‚Äù member so that we could have a small amount of coins replenished so we could still play games with people if our coins ran out were shocked to find out that the latest update took those privileges away. So here I am, after having paid real money to a ‚Äúfree game‚Äù, unable to play it. Now they are saying I have to pay MORE money in order to get enough coins to play again or wait 24 ours and hope there are enough ‚Äúfree gift‚Äù coins to play.

On top of that, I spent weeks trying to get enough coins to where I could safely play for awhile without worrying about losing and not being able to play the game again. Over 40,000 coins lost IN ONE GAME. And as a VIP member I cannot play again unless I pay more money OR wait until the ‚Äúfree spin‚Äù resets itself in 24 or 48 hours and then hope the prize is enough coins to play one game. 

 So beware. Total headache for a free game you pay money to for bogus special features."	positive
1163	1344700142	games	3	"I love the original game so I enjoy playing this but you just have to be patient and figure out how you can gain free rewards. Rewards are given out daily so there is always a game to play. If you want to compete with the top players then you need to study all parts of this app and choose wisely. I have played for about a year now and reached level 72 with an average balance of 40k coins and never spent a penny. I play daily just picking the games and levels that will win me some coins so I‚Äôm staying ahead of the game. At first it was annoying when you play against robot players or just plain stupid players who sabotage you. I now stay away from those players. If you‚Äôre lucky and score big on the upper level multiplayer game then you get the itch to try again and lose big time. Again play wisely, take less risks and you too can play daily for free. I must point out that the scratch offs are frustrating, at first every fourth or fifth one you would score a big reward, now I scratch fifty in a row and get the lowest reward every time. That proves it‚Äôs not random at all!  
This game is free with the options to buy coins, I choose to play for free since it‚Äôs free. Be patient and you too can play daily for free. Enjoy!!!! OIIIIIIIO"	positive
1164	1344700142	games	2	"There should be a classic mode where it costs no coins to play but you can win a small amount each time until you have enough to play other modes. My fianc√© and I have put a lot of money in the game to become vip members only to lose all coins and not be able to play for almost 24 hours until the ‚Äúfree gifts‚Äù reset which is barely enough for one game. I feel that the game coding needs work to where you don‚Äôt lose as many coins because the amount you lose compared to how much you use to start is way off and unfair. Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, I‚Äôm still going to play and I as a gamer and consumer understand the whole pay to play perspective but don‚Äôt have it to where once you are all out of coins that literally the only way to keep going is ‚ÄúPAY TO PLAY‚Äù. Hope this gets worked out soon.

Also for some reason whenever I play universe mode the app will always crash after a game or when loading into one which will cause me to lose. I have checked for updates and there are none. Could it be because I am playing on an iPhone 6 Plus

Also it‚Äôs hard to play Grand Prix when you don‚Äôt have diamonds and would be easier if there was a way to use coins. I cannot finish my build up challenge due to this"	positive
1165	1344700142	games	2	I have several problems.....First of all I LOVE this game, I played it in my childhood and adulthood. I have UNO cards in my game closet right now. One is I have spent too much money on this game and it is like a yo-yo effect!  I live on a fixed income and think I am buying things to help but in the long run! I end up losing everything, sometimes makes you think..well I‚Äôm gonna win big then you fizzle out....no money  (coins) left. You can not talk to the people on your friends list, other than what Mattel has set up for you to say. There are times when people feel used, feelings hurt, I can‚Äôt explain I am not snubbing you again I have no coins or money to spend. Also believe it or not people form friend ships and may want to be able to give their e-mails to each other.  The prices you have to play some games is unreasonable......The UNO Challenges sometimes a little much. Trying to get your medals another issue....... I understand pay to play but not take and take to play. In my opinion Mattel is getting rich off our backs............. I also think people should have the right to get some pictures and their names off the game. Some are offensive and disgusting! I know everyone gripes...SORRY! It is just my thoughts. Do not mean to offend anyone.  Thanks!!!	positive
1166	1344700142	games	1	I‚Äôve been playing for quite a while now. The last 10 days alone, 26 hours. Recently, I‚Äôve been on the biggest losing streak. Not because of wrong actions, but because of the cards that my opponents get. The people on my left and right are all getting plus 4s and stacking them on me. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm 10 seconds into the game or right before the game ends.. I get so many cards stacked against me and IÔ∏è lose a lot of coins. I‚Äôve even gone to 20x and 80x multiplier games hoping that maybe Uno was trying to push me into bigger leagues. Nope, I tested those out and the same issue happened. IÔ∏è had 30,000 points (that I‚Äôve earned though hard work) as VIP 1 (purchased VIP 1 for $1.99) now I have 4,000 within a matter of days. IÔ∏è have so many badges that I‚Äôve earned and I‚Äôm so proud of how far I‚Äôve progressed. IÔ∏è always share my accomplishment screen shots and stories with my friends. I love UNO. But I‚Äôve lost faith in the game now. Like others have said, they make you lose back to back in order to get you to spend real money in the store. I‚Äôve reached out to their support team and of course I have received a copy paste reply. Uno Support states that they cannot help in any way. They did not even offer to investigate the issue. I‚Äôm finding a new game and quitting Uno today.	positive
1167	1344700142	games	4	Uno is the best card game but is kind of getting tiring. What‚Äôs bugging me a lot is that when you get +4 when a person has uno like a +4 and a red card. The person +4 me it ask me a question if they have a yellow card I say no then get 4 cards. Does that mean they have a yellow card? Then they put a yellow card done on their turn! It‚Äôs like anyone I pick I get wrong! Now second thing spectating why can‚Äôt you see your friends rivals cards? But only their cards (partner/ friend) it‚Äôs not a big problem, but I just wanna see their cards like I do with non friends. The third thing loosing coins. Say your playing in a match of classic and you have 300 coins. You play a match it said you lost all your coins but loose 200. You check you should have 100. BUT no you have 0!? I don‚Äôt get it what‚Äôs the matter with the calculations? The last thing getting coins. Now your playing a match in classic. You win 100 coins and before you have 200. You then have 250. You didn‚Äôt get 50 of those coins. Does it go to the bank?! Why does it always happen!? Anyways this is a great game but I hope you just fix the problem. :)	positive
1168	1344700142	games	5	"I would say that this game is pretty fun to play. But their is some things that I don‚Äôt get. Okay so first of when I‚Äôm playing uno with a 2v2 or single. And for example the color was yellow. Okay so the person next to me keeps plucking cards from the stack because that person didn‚Äôt had yellow card. So when  that person pull out a draw 4 on me. Okay so it would say ‚Äúdo you think this person had a yellow card‚Äù. Or whatever . I would say NO because that person kept plucking cards from the card stack because he didn‚Äôt had a yellow card. And I would still get it wrong if that person didn‚Äôt had a yellow card, so what that means I would be the one getting the cards even though I clicked no because yeah that person didn‚Äôt had a yellow card. So I would say that this game is cheating when I click on the right one. 

Another thing is when someone pulls out a draw 2 I get skipped and wouldn‚Äôt be able to get a turn when someone pulls out a draw 2. So their is a few things that I don‚Äôt get about this game, but it‚Äôs fun to play though."	positive
1169	1344700142	games	5	Many people have been writing reviews saying things that are completely false! I have seen reviews saying the game is essentially pay-to-win with the coin mechanic; and that the game randomly takes away coins. This is not true! They may not have noticed the entry fee to games, and that is understandable. I have also seen reviews complaining about the mechanics in Wild mode, which you don‚Äôt even have to use! One review even says that getting skipped when a +2 or +4 is placed is ridiculous. While this is a real feature that cannot be avoided, but this is part of the game! If you have played the real card game, you will know this is essential to the game. In reality, this is one of the best takes on the original card game. I have never seen the card to play all cards of one color in any other orientation of Uno. I really enjoy it, and hope it makes an appearance in other Uno-based games. One thing I do dislike is the lack of the 0-7 and jump in rules. I really enjoy these twists to the game, and wish they were in this take on a classic game.	positive
1170	1344700142	games	1	This game is  a waste of time, it‚Äôs not fair when you play 2v2 because when your teammate messes up you still lose coins. Also if you lose once in any of the matches you lose like 200 coins or like all of your coins but if you win a match you only get 50 coins. this game is so stupid because you can‚Äôt even play anything without coins. Except for Uno Universe where you get 5 energy and have to wait 1 hour to get one energy refilled. Plus there‚Äôs this candy cane thing and you pick the cards and if you get a bomb you lose all your stuff. If you win or lose a match it‚Äôs so random you could be on a winning streak and have like 8000 coins and then lose one match and you have 0. ALSO THERE SHOULD be rules for when your playing 2v2 and the other player doesn‚Äôt play right because it‚Äôs not fair for the other teammate to lose all their coins. And not everything should cost coins I can‚Äôt even play the game right now because I played 2v2 wild under 500, I started off with 632 coins I played it and now I have 0 coins which I don‚Äôt under stand how I could lose 632 coins. This game isn‚Äôt right and should be deleted. Everything cost money if you‚Äôre wanna more coins cost money want more diamonds cost money. Just make a free game god. THIS GAME IS GOOD BUT EVERYTHING COST MONEY	positive
1171	1344700142	games	2	Some co workers and I play Uno at work when it‚Äôs slow. So during COVID-19 and no work I downloaded this Uno game. At first it was SO fun. There are a lot of pop up offers in this game and it‚Äôs clear they want you to spend money. However like most games I usually disregard and enjoy what I can for free. I had no realization the first day that I was ‚Äúspending‚Äù 100 coins in the game to play each round of Uno. That was until I ran out of coins. Surely there must be a daily reward or some way to watch Ads and get free coins. There is! The only thing that I don‚Äôt like is I earned only 10 coins for logging in to play, now I have exactly 100 coins to play a game that‚Äôs essentially based off chance. If I lose, I not only lose the game but they take your coins. Then there is a little present box you can click on (IF it pops up) it will allow you to watch an ad for a prize. I only like the prize box when it gives me coins - so I can play more uno. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll keep the game much longer, it‚Äôs not fun to play a game one time and can‚Äôt play it again all day because you have no coins. Although called uno it‚Äôs not meant to be played once.	positive
1172	1344700142	games	3	"I love UNO, and I was excited to see a new version in the App Store after another uno multiplayer that shall not be named. It‚Äôs definitely less annoying than that one, but the coin element is still in place. From a business perspective it makes sense so the developers can take advantage of kids with their parents‚Äô credit cards, but from a players perspective it doesn‚Äôt. Why not just let people play how/when they want?
Speaking of children: the graphics get very annoying, very fast. All the crazy colors and graphics are disorienting, which I think ties into an ethics problem: its the same tactic casinos use with slot machines/other electronic gambling games, and there‚Äôs definitely a gambling element involved. The more coins you have, the higher you can ‚Äúbid‚Äù (although more often than not you end up losing 80% of your coins this way and are knocked back to start the cycle over again). This makes the game pretty addictive (in a bad way), so beware recovering gambling addicts!

It really takes the fun out of a simple tabletop game that shouldn‚Äôt have to resort to these gimmicks to rope people in."	positive
1173	1344700142	games	1	The points at the end of the game are not accurately deducted nor is the correct amount of coins deducted.  I‚Äôve made the mistake of spending money for this game in the past.  I wouldn‚Äôt mind spending $20 per month for the game if I had unlimited play or so many coins that I would never burn through them for the entire month because the coins are what you need to enter the GO Wild Games, which are the most fun.  I like the newer deluxe monthly card offering in the app, except for the fact that it isn‚Äôt anywhere close to enough coins in each category to make it worth spending $20 per month.  The coins offered for the month should be unlimited or an amount so high you are guaranteed to get through the month because the the way you loose coins and the amount of coins lost in the game is ridiculous! If 812,000 people that liked their Facebook page spent $20 per month and they could play all month and have the option for other in app purchases, that‚Äôs along the lines of $16, 240,000 PER MONTH as a baseline!  This is virtual money not worth anything to anyone, so when there is a glitch, your account should be restored appropriately.  Poor management and poor customer service really as well.	positive
1174	1344700142	games	1	"I can‚Äôt play this game unless I have coins?

I will be playing this game maybe once every 6 hours because there is little to no ways to earn coins in this game. Unless you give them hard earned $$ that isüòëüòëüòë no thank you.

1175	1344700142	games	4	I loved playing Uno with my family and friends in person so playing on here with all of the same crazy rules is a lot of fun. However, when you first start off, all of the options and purchases and menus can be very overwhelming, and they don‚Äôt explain where everything is or what everything does (i.e. there‚Äôs a daily spin, beginners chests, daily rewards, etc. but they‚Äôre all under different menus). Also, the announcer guy gets annoying very quickly (especially when people keep getting uno over and over again). Can you add a way to turn just the announcer off but keep the rest of the audio? Also, the games can be pretty short. I understand that games can go on for a long time and you want a way to control for that, but I like playing longer games and not having to worry about running out of time during my turn so quickly (especially when challenged with a draw 4). Maybe you can add a mutator where you can play without a time limit. Other than that, the game is pretty nice.	positive
1176	1344700142	games	3	I do highly recommend this game, I‚Äôve been playing it for a year and it is a lot of fun. Uno is one of my all time favorite card games and leveling up and getting badges and higher ranks made this game so much better! I even got to play against my boyfriend and friends. Well, one day I go to play and somehow I‚Äôm logged out of my account. I never linked it to my Facebook or updated my phone and now it‚Äôs promoting me to only login via Facebook. When I do, it‚Äôs making me start all over so I basically lost my whole account. But not really, my friends still see my account exists but I cannot get into it. I‚Äôve reached out to Uno multiple times ( 4 to be exact) and was told to supply my game ID and to create a new ID so they could see it was made with the same  device. I provided this information to them again and again and still nothing. I will not play this game anymore because I do not want to start all over getting back a year worth of progress. My advice is to link your account with SOMETHING because one day you can lose it and Uno will not help you to get it back.	positive
1177	1344700142	games	3	"I used to enjoy playing this game.  I understand the ‚Äúfreemium‚Äù concept, but at least through ad supported measures, one used to be able to watch vids and ads and earn enough coin to continue playing.  The most recent update, however, changed that.  Ads that support earning coin (up to 6 a day) are available to select, but once selected, a message comes up that ‚Äúno ads are available at this time‚Äù.  Additionally, I am forced to watch ads at the end of every game which was not the case before - and there is no reward to watching these ads.  

The game is somewhat ‚Äúrigged‚Äù in that losers lose more coin than winners gain - which means over time you will always be down some coin.  It‚Äôs the cost of playing, imo, but there have to be opportunities for the casual player to make up those losses.

Again, I understand what ‚Äúfree‚Äù means and how to upgrade the user experience using money.

I would of gave 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è to this wonderful great challenging game but where is the freebies after I spent so much money this month along like $20 on this very addictive fun game but can be better come on guys give us a break and allow more freebies ‚ù§Ô∏èüëåüèº	positive
1179	1344700142	games	3	When I first started playing this game, I was addicted to it, then a few days ago, I have over 2,000 coins, well I kept losing because people kept playing draw 4 cards and draw 2, I couldn‚Äôt do anything about that, but I lost all my coins to this day and I‚Äôm really annoyed with that because I lost hundreds and thousands of coins in a matter of days, and the fact I have to pay more for these dumb fees is just unbearable.  And now I only have 10 coins.  I lost all my coins, and I can‚Äôt even win any in anyway possible because I play uno universe and it‚Äôs impossible because I can‚Äôt get all the achievements just to get 100 coins (enough to play 1 uno classic game) and something else.  And I really want to play this game with my friends, but I can‚Äôt, when I win 40 coins, I have to lose 30 for the fee, so I‚Äôm really only getting 10 coins. And in the single modes is you win less than 30 coins, you actually have less money than you started off with.  And it‚Äôs really annoying. So please just change this in the game and then I will be happier! Thanks.	positive
1180	1344700142	games	5	I love this game soo much but I feel they can do a little better like the people with the lesser cards should come in first place you‚Äôll have two cards left and they‚Äôll still take your coins and say that you lost and I feel that they should work on the game more far as technical difficulties the game will freeze in the middle of a round and once it unfreezes the game would be over and you would of lost your coins by than. However I love the game and it‚Äôs very addicting I just hate when you have to update it because it want let you do it and causes more problems and it‚Äôll be hard for you to get back on there. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it‚Äôs still not working I just wish y‚Äôall would quit updating the versions because it‚Äôs very frustrating to not be able to log back into uno. I‚Äôve been waiting all day and it‚Äôs still not working I guess I‚Äôll just check out uno and friends because y‚Äôall have a lot of fixing to do.	positive
1181	1344700142	games	2	"The RNG and weird +4 rule ruins the game. First of all, of course the game has to be played by randomization but it seems like you lose more than you win and that‚Äôs due to the fact that they use a point system to determine how many coins you lose, which is ridiculous imo. If you hold wildcards or action cards by the end of the match, you lose more points, which leads to losing more coins. But, this is how they make money; once you‚Äôre completely out of coins and the game stops it‚Äôs handouts of a few hundred here and there, you must buy more coins with real life money. Even the silver and gold packs they give you are rigged; you‚Äôll almost never get the better prizes and settle with 10 or 20 coins each time. It‚Äôs an unforgiving, greedy system. 
Secondly, the +4 rule... who thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to have you guess if the player who played the +4 has a certain color and that determines whether you draw SIX cards or if the other player draws 4 instead. It‚Äôs inconsistent. 9 times out of 10, you‚Äôll guess wrong and have to pull 6 cards. 
You‚Äôll quit within a week, that‚Äôs how long I lasted. Save your money, stay safe."	negative
1182	1344700142	games	1	The second you load into this game you are greeted by a thrift store version of the Mario Kart theme song. It is all fun and games for the first few games.  Maybe you feel a little edgy, so you stroll over to some of the mini games. Now no doubt they are fun. Until you notice that just about every time you finally win some coins and go play big on a game. You lose it all. Now okay, the first few times maybe it‚Äôs just coincidence right? (I won‚Äôt say anything about the other players. *cough* bots *cough*) Maybe the first few games you really did have the most cards, so you deserve to lose more. But that‚Äôs not how the scoring works. In fact, you have no clue how the scoring works in this game. The numbers are random, sometimes on a team with someone, instead of losing the same amount of coins, you lose almost 3x the amount. Setting you all the way the back to 0 coins. Meaning no games... And who doesn‚Äôt want to play Uno? Now sure, you get 300 coins every-so-often. But every time you go back to play. It happens again... and again... and again... The whole while you‚Äôre backing out to the main menu just to get hit with an ad to buy more coins. Just to play uno...	positive
1183	1344700142	games	5	As a lifelong fan of uno, and a heavy player of the previous mobile version of uno made by gameloft, I can tell you this one is much better.  They have perfected the uno experience with this one.  It is amazing.  And to all the people who are complaining about losing all their coins, I would recommend you stay in the 2x and 4x games until you better understand how to play, because this game is very heavy on the strategy (especially in 2 player mode), but is extremely fun once you have a better understanding of what to do in certain situations.  And to the developers if you see this, don‚Äôt change they game to acquiesce to these weaker players, but I would suggest you get rid of telling players they are a big fish in a small pond or whatever by suggesting early on that the players should keep going up and playing 8x 20x etc, they will just get wiped out and lose all their coins and have to start over at 100 again and again.	positive
1184	1344700142	games	2	Uno is a very fun and addicting game. I just don‚Äôt see the point of wasting all your coins on one match which is really annoying because first of all, you have to pay 30 coins just to get into a match. Second is because you waste a lot of coins if you lose I mean come on, this isn‚Äôt a casino, do you really have to lose coins every time you lose a round? This is why I always run out of coins because most of the time you lose a game because I have a slight suspicion that this game is rigged up to make you win about 3 times and lose the rest of your 20 times playing. Another thing about it is the timer and the challenging. When you do a challenge you have a 50/50 chance of getting it right or wrong. It doesn‚Äôt matter anyway because even if you do get it right, you still get a penalty of many cards and what‚Äôs with the timer? Whenever my family and I play uno, we never get timed whenever we play a match 3 minutes is WAY to short to get barely anything done!!  Well, I don‚Äôt really recommend this rigged game to anybody bu I think you get my point. It‚Äôs fun but is a true waste of time.	negative
1185	1344700142	games	5	"I‚Äôve never been the type to sit and play phone games (even the race car ones on the toilet) but I can‚Äôt put UNO! Down! It‚Äôs my escape from being a new mom and you meet some cool people on there. (Not like a chat site, just smart people who show you different card moves you never thought of and different combos you can do) I always try to put myself in the shoes of my opponent and block their winnings. I usually earn up to 1,000 points every time I play. I love the 2vrs mode where you have a partner and it‚Äôs 2 on 2. 
I honestly would only fix the constant ‚Äúbank‚Äù of coins they show for you to upgrade and get more points. I have about 5,000 coins that I keep ‚Äúwinning‚Äù every game however you can only ‚Äúunlock‚Äù those points if you pay for it. Pretty stupid, but a good game has to have some faults and they need to make money somehow so I‚Äôm not mad at it. 

Download this game. Unless you‚Äôre like a wuss who can‚Äôt play a game. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"	positive
1186	1344700142	games	4	I get that some are comparing this to Gameloft‚Äôs version of Uno ‚Äî I was a die-hard fan too, and sad to see it go ‚Äî but this version fills the hole nicely.  It does take a little getting used to if you liked the other version, but after a couple weeks of playing it, I‚Äôm sold.  And it seems to have way fewer issues, than Gameloft‚Äôs did.  (Plus, when they are down for system maintenance, etc., they give you rewards to help ease the pain ‚Äî works for me!). There are also some fun and interesting spins on the game that, I think, make it more enjoyable.  And there are a ton of ways to earn free tokens so it‚Äôs easy to play without having to pay money!  The only complaint I have is that they don‚Äôt seem to give a thorough explanation of the features, at least none that I can find within the game itself.  I imagine there‚Äôs probably something on the internet somewhere, but I‚Äôve mostly been learning the ropes from trial and error. All-in-all, I‚Äôd highly recommend it for your Uno fix!	positive
1187	1344700142	games	4	"I‚Äôm highkey addicted to this game and it‚Äôs all fun and games till I‚Äôm too low on coins to play a match and watch 27 ads out of pure despair. I feel like they need to make the coins lost from a match either less, or at least more consistent. I‚Äôll play a 200 coin match with like 400 in my bank, and losing bankrupts me. But yesterday I got first in a 1000 coin match (meaning everyone involved has at least that much coins) but got a little under 200 coins. I realize lowering the coin loss from matches also lowers how much you get if you win, so think it‚Äôd the best move to just make the ratio more consistent

Also, I‚Äôd rlly love to see them implement different game modes/mechanics to make it more interesting. Because as it is it can get a little bland. And also, it can seem like no mad how good you are with strategy, it doesn‚Äôt matter, because a lot of times the games already over before it starts because your hand is too weak. But i guess that‚Äôs just uno."	positive
1188	1344700142	games	4	"There are pros & cons about what I like and don‚Äôt like about this game:
Pros are that you can play with a teammate and there are daily goals to achieve.
Cons are that once you get hit with a 4+ card or 2+ card you won‚Äôt get a chance to play you will get skipped üòì. Also if a team player draws a 4+ and they chose a color you have to guess if they have the same color they have in their deck, if they do you get 6+ cards and they don‚Äôt you still end up with the 4+ cards. But overall guessing what the other team player has? I think that rule should be taken away, just not fair and it‚Äôs not really a rule when it comes to UNO. Also the shields to protect the coins you have, I barely get them because I am not paying for diamonds out of my pocket. They should be earn daily (for free).
Either way I enjoy playing the game just to complete the daily goals and to kill time. Hopefully they can improve with the rules and gaining diamonds or coins without paying for them out of pocket."	positive
1189	1344700142	games	3	There are often days where you will come onto this game and know for a fact that you‚Äôre about to lose practically every game. And if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that it were real people playing you‚Äôd think the game is COMPLETELY rigged. But when it starts becoming easier to actually guess exactly what‚Äôs in the persons hand because the ‚Äúat random dealt cards‚Äù is the same as the last game you played in, meanwhile the hand dealt to you is garbage and you can‚Äôt seem to figure out why you‚Äôre never dealt hands that are similar. The game knows you‚Äôre going to want to spend money to get more diamonds or coins and that‚Äôs the hack of this specific game. There‚Äôs no way you should be losing a game nine times in a row the same exact way (the persons last card always managing to be a draw four). NOT TO MENTION the coin ratios aren‚Äôt fair. You could lose 3000 coins but when you do the EXACT same play in another game you‚Äôll only get 300 coins for it. It‚Äôs rigged and becomes repetitive, redundant and just makes you not want to play at all.	positive
1190	1344700142	games	2	"This game is actually a lot of fun but sometimes I‚Äôll play a game for like 18 coins, for example, and if I lose the round I‚Äôll end up losing ALL of the coins, even if I have over a thousand. While other times I‚Äôll only lose a very low number of coins for the same game. It makes no sense. And usually you lose way more than you gain. I think it might have to do with how many coins everyone playing has? but I think a gambling system would work a lot better and be a lot more fair since everyone will play knowing exactly what they‚Äôre going to be getting.

I‚Äôll spend a lot of time gaining thousands of coins only to lose them all in one or two games. It‚Äôs not a good way to get people to want to buy coins. A gambling-type system would be way more effective. If they added a different and more fair way to gain/lose coins this would definitely be my favorite mobile game as of rn, but it‚Äôs severely lacking in that aspect, which unfortunately is the biggest aspect to me since it dictates how much I play. I‚Äôm just very disappointed. I expected better."	positive
1191	1344700142	games	4	"Take the time to test the game yourself before reading the reviews. Uno, at the heart, is a game of both skill and luck. Skill to know how to play (when to drop a draw two or a draw four, etc) and luck, simply because you never know what hand you‚Äôll be dealt. I‚Äôve read some reviews that complained about this being a P2w (pay to win) you do NOT have to pay to win on this game. 

Other reviews critiqued the draw four concept. Let‚Äôs do an example. The person ahead of you has two cards, on of them is a draw four, while the other is a red card. When they play that draw four, the game asks you if you THINK they have the color that was being played previously. If you hit yes, and you‚Äôre wrong, you draw SIX cards. You can decline and say no, and only draw the four that was initiated the moment that draw four was dropped. 

The game is fun, and yes, you‚Äôre going to lose a few games. Take a break and come back and hope for better luck."	positive
1192	1344700142	games	3	"I agree with other reviews that this game is fun, nay addicting. There is some strategy involved, but there is also a lot of luck‚Äîobviously your ability to win or lose has a lot to do with the cards that get dealt and drawn versus other players. I‚Äôve had days where I‚Äôve been dealt endless crappy hands, making it difficult to win and the enjoyment turns to frustration and a desire to never play again. Also, occasionally there are server issues which make it so you time out in your hand, so the AI takes over and sometimes that ruins your strategy. 

A bit ago I experienced a weird game glitch where my team should have won in 2v2. I‚Äôve been playing a while and I‚Äôm well versed in the rules. I emailed the developer and that was a bad experience...they kept explaining the rules to me, when it‚Äôs obvious that there was a glitch. 

When it‚Äôs fun it‚Äôs a blast, but bad customer support coupled with server glitches are making me more and more likely to turn away from this game."	positive
1193	1344700142	games	4	So at first I found myself desperate to find an uno game in the App Store, while looking I came across this one. Despite the fact that there were poor reviews I proceeded in downloading this game to give it a chance. Turns out the graphics are good, the sound effects are funny and appropriate for the situations in the game, and the controls are decent. The only issue that I really came across was the connection. I can‚Äôt claim that I had poor connection due to the game, because my WiFi just isn‚Äôt the best, however, when I played and there was a connection error, and the game didn‚Äôt lag out or crash on me, it just went back to reconnecting and let me continue playing. The features of this game are pretty good as well. So as my review I‚Äôm giving this 4‚òÜ out of 5 because I believe this game has a lot of potential. Keep up the great work developers, and maybe look into some of the bugs reported. Other than that, I‚Äôd say this was pretty well made.	positive
1194	1344700142	games	1	The game is fun but all the players are garbage and the bots are so annoying. The boys are everywhere and even though there are enough real players to fill a game, it fills the game with bots. Also in wild, if someone plays a plus 2 and then someone else plays a plus 4, you have to draw a bunch of cards. It also seems like the bots know your cards and do everything in their power to make the person opposite from you win or just make it the one color you don‚Äôt have. The bots also have an amazing hand while you get a whole bunch of crappy cards. The time limit also needs to be increased. Also if you have no coins then you can‚Äôt play which is ridiculous because I don‚Äôt want to wait 24 hours to play a game I enjoy playing. The cost for wild card is confusing because it doesn‚Äôt say how much it costs to play and has 10 coins or 18 coins written on it. I like playing uno but they have taken a good game and ruined it. Bots are too advanced and it pairs you with people who are no where near as good as you or people 40 levels ahead of you. Needs to pair people with people of the same skill level. Would not recommend.	positive
1195	1344700142	games	1	At first I thought it was a good game I won a couple matches and enjoyed it. The second day I was losing ALL THE TIME like this game is just rigged. Also the game keeps on encouraging me over and over to get a membership and whatever. The game is pretty much a money hungry app. WHAT ARE YOU HIDING MATTEL?! I REALLY NEED SOMEONE TO UNDERSTAND JUST DONT GET THIS GAME I SWEAR. The matches are just... IDK it‚Äôs just a complete waste of time. And I‚Äôm not a hater it‚Äôs just the game is pretty much stupid. And this might be a dumb reason but in the normal Uno in real life you could say UNO! If someone has 1 card and you say it before they do. But in this rip-off you can only say it if you‚Äôre the one with the lucky last card. The voice every time you lose is kinda annoying for me just ‚Äú DoNt sTop nOw ‚Äú ITS ANNOYING I RATHER HAVE A REGULAR COMPUTER VOICED GENERATOR THAN THAN EWW. EVERYTIME ITS SO HORRIBLE. AND EVERYTIME I READ A COMMENT OF THIS GAME NO MATTER THE GOOD OR BAD COMMENT THE DEVELOPER IS LIKE : ThAnk YoU 4 yOuR fEedBaCk! it‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt even care or try to fix someone‚Äôs problems. They are just some sarcastic, money hungry, stupid company that just makes the game for money. Only a sicko would do that Mattel Your JUST GREEDY.	negative
1196	1344700142	games	1	This game may seems fun at first until you loose more coins than you receive. When you purchase shields for protection and win you‚Äôll lose those too. Sometimes the game will freeze and force your hand. Silver and Golden scratch cards have the same reward  which doesn‚Äôt make sense ü§î shouldn‚Äôt the Golden card offer higher/ better rewards? Almost every power up/ protection shield etc requires blue diamonds to purchase. Very few blue diamonds are given / earned otherwise you have to purchase these. You can only purchase clovers with Uno coins you earn or purchase with real money. Why not offer more items to purchase using Uno coins? Uno universe is your only hope to possibly win 100 coins if you earn all three required paws when goals are complete... (if you run out or lose all of your coins). When you notice discrepancies with rewards promised during Uno challenges (Uno Likes Challenge on Facebook) they unfairly distribute rewards calling it random. Rules for the challenges are not clear and there‚Äôs no accountability. Excuses are provided even though some user don‚Äôt receive any rewards. Unbelievable!	positive
1197	1344700142	games	3	"I love uno but this one needs to be fixed. If a player goes afk during game play it‚Äôs because the computer kicks in and plays for them this will either happen at start of game until timer is at 1 min 50 seconds and the player then plays because they r guaranteed to win or at the 1 minute 50 second mark the player will stop playing for the same reason because game takes over and they again win because of the cards the automatic game player gave them. In the last 30 seconds of play time left the one in 1 and 2 place will allow the timer to run out. 
If I wanted to play with an automatic computer generated game I would play Microsoft solitaire. 
If mattel would just implement a lose your turn per the afk players it would make a huge difference and real players may actually return. As it is now I would never spend real money to play this game. This behavior is not just isolated to the free players but also to the vip players, and uno cup as well."	positive
1198	1344700142	games	3	"I like to play with my girlfriend when we get bored. We had lost six ridiculously fast games in a row when all of a sudden the losses from the x2 game mode went from 200 coins to 500. We both lost all our coins that we had just watched all the available ads to get. This is ridiculous. We can‚Äôt play again for two hours, unless we spend money. Not gonna happen if we could lose all of it at once in the lowest risk game mode. 

The app also has a vip option. This displays a ribbon on your icon, showing you‚Äôve made a purchase. If you look at your profile in the home screen and notice it says V.I.P. you should know that this doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre vip. Don‚Äôt tap it. If you do, it will push you to continue through the steps of purchasing all the way to purchasing. You can only cancel when iTunes asks you to confirm the purchase. This is clearly a ploy to push kids into accidentally buying things. Not a very classy move."	negative
1199	1344700142	games	1	"Honestly, I was enjoying this game. It was fun! It seemed pretty balanced on winning and losing 50/50. However, recently I have not had good matches, and I understand that‚Äôs not a reason to give a bad review so here‚Äôs the rest. 
I had over 20,000 coins and lost it all in 10 games of go wild x4 2v2. In the majority of those games I lost horribly because the opposing team had a discard all of all the colors they had AND THREE +4s, or other various wild, any color cards. There is NO beating that. 
I have HAD that hand and I call it the ‚Äúpity hand‚Äù because it‚Äôs like the game is saying, ‚Äúhere you go, here‚Äôs a FREE win! And 2000 coins!‚Äù It is horrible and seems like a purposeful game mechanic which is beyond frustrating even when you are the one to receive the hand. It‚Äôs not fair and just makes the game not fun because it‚Äôs so unbalanced. 
It also doesn‚Äôt help that the announcing voice when you lose is so patronizing. It‚Äôs just insult to injury. 
Mattel please. I know you can stop those kinds of hands just tweak the system a bit so I, and many others I‚Äôve read reviews, can enjoy this game again."	positive
1200	474259675	travel	3	"First and foremost, there needs to be a ‚Äúcontact us about this store‚Äù feature like the Love‚Äôs app that sends a message to both the store and corporate. I don‚Äôt always want to speak to a manager, and I would feel better knowing a team at corporate is following up on the resolution to reported problems. If the messaging system were built into the app, you could preload it with certain topics (maintenance, cleanliness, food, parking, staff, other, etc.) and respond directly to drivers about the progress of the reported issue. It goes a long way when people feel heard and see results.

I have encountered stores which have Reserve parking, but it doesn‚Äôt appear in the app. I have also been to a location that the app says has the enhanced WiFi experience, but it doesn‚Äôt. When I asked the store, the manager knew about the problem but the information in the app hasn‚Äôt been corrected. I called the main customer service number, but hung up after waiting on hold too long.

For a few months, the app has said I have one notification, but nothing is indicated once inside the app. I have navigated to every page and even deleted and reinstalled the app and the ‚Äú1‚Äù notification is still there.

Update***Well, I have emailed them and they said that they are not accepting major credit cards yet. I was told it would be available end of September. It‚Äôs October 1 now. Thought maybe it was fixed in this last update but nope. Not to mention, it clearly states in the ‚ÄúFAQ‚Äù section of the my wallet section of their app that major credit cards can be entered. Like I said, it‚Äôs worse to offer an app that promises big but delivers little. Always under promise and over deliver because it makes me not want to use this company anymore. 

I‚Äôve been trying and trying to enter in other payment cards and it keeps telling me the same thing, trouble communicating with the server. Been going on for a long time now, there have been 3 or so updates and it‚Äôs still dong it. Either get serious about this app or abandon it and remove it.

I can‚Äôt believe how much longer it takes to input all the information requested into the app in order to get the pump started. Granted, it‚Äôs faster and easier than the old way when you had to go inside to fuel desk first. It is still usually faster to swipe your card at the pump and input information into prompts on pump display. Using it to reserve a shower is nice, when it works. I‚Äôve found many locations that say ‚Äú5 drivers waiting‚Äù so I decide to shower in the morning only to go inside to use restroom and the screen says ‚Äú2 showers available, no wait‚Äù.

1204	474259675	travel	2	One can tell that this app was designed by a developer without any input from everyday users.  The app is not the least bit intuitive.  For instance, on my very first use, I launched the app, then clicked on ‚Äúfuel‚Äù.  It listed my rewards membership number followed by three dots.  I entered that rewards number at the gas pump and the pump  would not accept it.  That is because the three trailing dots meant there were additional numbers not showing, yet there was no way to expand the screen or tap on the number to get the full membership number.  Very illogical and stupid.  That is just one example of the ignorance driven app design.  Flying J needs to assemble a user‚Äôs group to obtain valuable customer input/feedback.  Apps are supposed to work for the customer.  With this app, I have to work hard for it.  Ridiculous.  Back to the drawing board guys!	positive

In order to do anything online requires that location services be turned off, or else it just buffers endlessly. What you get for $245/mon.... The problem with this app is that it DEMANDS that it be turned on. Not just once, but every SINGLE time you navigate to a different page within the app you have to decline. Over, and over, and over, and over. Maybe I just don‚Äôt WANT the app to know where I am! What difference does it make? If I‚Äôm missing features I DONT CARE, by turning on my location services the app wouldn‚Äôt work anyway! Let ME choose ONCE.

Now i can even get my shower ready from my phone !Wow turn my fuel pump !wow amazing, the only thing is I would like to see some kind of enforcement on people parking on the fuel island and not fueling ,also get rid of your pay to park spots pilot should try to get some kind of tax deduction for every parking spot for us to park now that more rest areas are being closed maybe that tax deduction would encourage truck stops to make bigger parking lots	positive
1207	474259675	travel	5	I like how it from the app we can now turn on the pump reserve a shower see how many points we have and also see what pilot is offering for free to the drivers and what other sales are going on at the pilot store straight from the app. I love the way that pilot is making the fueling process quicker for drivers who are running a Electronic Logs. My only wish is that pilot would somehow enter gate the premium parking into the app itself and not direct you to another site and also that premium parking accepts the driver‚Äôs company EFS card as well. The pilot app at self is easy to use and very convenient for today‚Äôs drivers. Hands-down I give 5 stars.	positive
1208	474259675	travel	5	Tremendous strides have been made to keep those of us road warriors on top of fuel prices,reserve parking,and my wife‚Äôs favorite reserving a shower before we set foot in the truck stop. No more monthly truck magazines cluttering up my truck. Everything is updated in a  timely fashion whether it‚Äôs a new truck stop location or however many parking spots are available. Just point and click for instant accurate information on food items or a potential shop to perform light duty mechanical work. One stop shop, you can tell Warren Buffet has his hand in the Pilot/Flying J empire.	positive

   Hi,
Thank you all for what you do, first.
Love the app. But today, I am on shower power but when I placed my shower by app. It still shows I am in a shower I was not or gives me same shower from somonelse (glitch) . Last, closing the app to later take another shower at the same place, it still shows I am in that same shower I was not in that morning so night comes and still not able to request a shower from app and still showing that same shower I was never in. Smile got a shower  but the reset on the app still showing wrong information and still unable to us app to request a shower? HELP."	positive
1210	474259675	travel	5	Fast responding app. no error not once.. the complaints come from non verizon users :)) Fueling is faster, shower reservation too... great especially if you are team.. the only thing that i would suggest is either pilot card - apple wallet integration ( if possible ) ( preferably) or a easier way to have my pro card scanned at the counter..  now i'm going to my saved offers to have it scanned. a lot of buttons to press.. :)) thanks for keeping up with technology and thanks for decent travel stops!	positive
1211	474259675	travel	2	I have used Ta and Petro for last year, recently started new job Chicago to LA only using pilot flying j, when I‚Äôm at a location it can never find me for awhile, it‚Äôd be faster to run in and swipe my card at the kiosk, most locations out west always seem to have a 4 or 5 people waiting for showers, this is disappointing, don‚Äôt have the time to wait as a team, and can‚Äôt seem to get in the queue earlier.  Maybe more shower help, I never had to wait for a shower at ta/petro, plus their app would let you get in line as long as you were there in 10 min. Always get the oops we can‚Äôt find you hit refresh page and I will be in the building.	negative
1212	474259675	travel	3	"I do not like being asked, every time I reserve a shower, if I want to receive notifications. To make it worse, this new version sends a pop up with some BS comment that makes absolutely zero sense, with a yes/no option, that is probably asking about notifications again. This should be a one time question. Once it‚Äôs set, that should be it.

That is the only complaint I have about the app itself. I like the rest of it, and will like the new version once I get used to it. However, it doesn‚Äôt always connect to the store, which costs me points when I can‚Äôt use it."	negative
1213	474259675	travel	2	"The old version was bad, this version is worse. Have to sign in each time. It has two loyalty cards for me, neither of which belong to me. I can't load MY loyalty card, therefore I don't trust it enough to put my company fuel card on there. Won't show me my points, showers, or anything. Each version of this app has gotten worse. I hate to be so negative, but I hate this app.

Updated review, 2 stars
It‚Äôs better.  My only problem is that I still have trouble resetting my password, without calling customer service. When calling customer service I get put on hold.
Other than that it‚Äôs a great app."	negative
1214	474259675	travel	4	The app has gotten better and better throughout the last year adding the fueling made it quick and convenient for diesel fueling. And the ordering a shower is awesome too.   I would just suggest adding a notification when your shower is up if there are no immediate open showers.  That would save wasted time standing around inside waiting that I could be doing paper work or getting some exercise.  Other than that app is great and continually gets better.	positive
1215	474259675	travel	3	Ever since the app has been updated when you check in for a shower it will tell you initially how many people are in line before you, but once you make a reservation it no longer tells you how many people are in line. Used to it would count down so you could wait in your truck or handle an errand ect and know when to head in... now, there‚Äôs almost no difference in checking in at the kiosk or on the app. You have to go in and wait with everyone else basically.	negative
1216	474259675	travel	5	I can‚Äôt reserve showers now. Since the update it says I‚Äôm next in line for a shower and nothing I do resets it. The app now constantly changes while I‚Äôm looking at it and is all over the place as if someone is tapping options for me. Nothing is organized and the whole thing is completely unstable now. It has now become a jumbled scrolling mess with useless options as soon as the app opens.	negative
1217	474259675	travel	3	"Seems such an obvious feature to be implemented. I don‚Äôt much care for the 30 seconds(now 20) it takes to launch the app and find  my loyalty barcode.
I have frequently visited loves when the choice is mine to make specifically for ease of app and barcode.

Still visiting loves because they always have free WiFi. I‚Äôll use pilot if I have a WiFi credit but the app doesn‚Äôt show WiFi credits anymore. 
Also breaking the 24 hour credit into 2 12 hour credits would be swell mister."	positive

When I saved the reward, it showed then showed a Coke and A Diet Coke.   I went to the register and showed my Pilot Rewards card and the the reward on the app. I ended up paying for both of the Coke Zeros. The manager wouldn‚Äôt over ride the register. I then showed her that Coke Zero was on the original notification but when we went back to the Rewards page the BOGO Coke and Diet Coke were no longer on the Saved Rewards   The manager still wouldn‚Äôt override register even after seeing that the reward had been redeemed.	positive
1219	474259675	travel	1	I‚Äôve been driving and stopping at flying j/pilots for about a month now using my 10.5 iPad as my main source of directions and where to stop. I just swapped my 10.5 with my sisters 12.9 and this app no longer functions correctly. I am unable to click on the map locations and bring up the next screen which would show me that locations details, the option to call the flying j is the only one there now and it doesn‚Äôt go away even when I don‚Äôt have a location chosen. I‚Äôd highly recommend testing this app on a 12.9 iPad so you can work out the bugs.	negative
1220	474259675	travel	1	I never leave reviews, in fact this is my first in the Apple Store. I‚Äôm really disappointed. I try to login, but forgot my password, so sent the reset password link to my email where it then told me there was no account under email. Then re-opened app to create an account with my email, and its asking me security questions for that email. How if there‚Äôs no account? Why can‚Äôt I login? What‚Äôs worse is every time I try to call, I‚Äôm on hold for AT LEAST 10 minutes, then I just hang up. Every single time. This is horrible! You just lost a customer for your app, Pilot.	negative

Later that day I open my bank app and I noticed they were charge me $500 instead of $200 I called customer service and I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs my bank üòÇüòÇ holding it. after that she said some location maybe hold my money. No more app for me. If you going to use this app just letting you know what you can expect.	positive
1222	474259675	travel	3	"I love the app but two major points could be improved:
1) quit asking me to share my location. Every tab asks again. At most you should only ask when i first open the app.
2) default to favorites onnthe map view. It takes about 10+ seconds to load all the data which is unacceptable. Either a smaller radiois or default to favorites. I‚Äôm not in a populated area but many Pilot locations pop up which causes a significant delay."	positive
1223	474259675	travel	3	"This is a great app but would be absolute better if they add more points to drivers who are consistent on fueling at their stores. Plus I would really appreciate if Pilot/Flying J would fix the app back to where you can put yourself in line or reserve while your still in the truck again. If you can then you need to fix whatever it is that is stopping me from doing so. It‚Äôs not my phone or my carrier. I have an iPhone and att so I know it‚Äôs the app. 
I‚Äôll really appreciate the help"	positive
1224	474259675	travel	3	1st off I‚Äôve had a Red #1 alert for at least 6 months. I‚Äôve been through the entire app and there‚Äôs no lingering notification. It‚Äôs stayed there through numerous updates and deleting and reinstalling the app. Secondly there needs to be a way to rate each location on different things such as cleanliness,parking,etc... and leave reviews. As far as function I haven‚Äôt had any problems that weren‚Äôt easily fixed, it just seems lacking in content.	negative
1225	474259675	travel	5	Because of this up lol I stopped fueling at loves, TA and Petro lol.. I like how you can use the app instead of swiping for fuel and it saves the info which is even faster. Also it tells u which pumps are available for fueling . I just wish the app works with every pilot n fj location but unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt., overall I love this app and the coupons I get as well can‚Äôt forget that	positive
1226	474259675	travel	5	Nothing but your typical give & take relationship here. They give me gas to buy and I buy that gas and take it. It‚Äôs simple yet beautiful and I like that in a gas & diesel station.  But.... they‚Äôre sooo much more than that. Showers for the truckers and every car/truck accessory you can think of. They‚Äôve got to have it here at Flying J or there sister establishments Pilot or Loves.	positive
1227	474259675	travel	5	Like other reviewer‚Äôs have said this app NEEDS a way to DIRECTLY ‚Äúcontact the store manager‚Äù  AND a ‚Äúrate this location‚Äù option.  When a serious problem comes up there is NO way to report it other than to the manager. But what if the manager IS the problem like in Barstow ca recently. The complaint stops with the offender. THATS NOT COOL!	negative

Then still go to the app and see what free or what deals I can get. 
Now all this is a winning combination!!!!!!"	positive
1230	474259675	travel	5	Best thing about the pilot app is that I no longer need to enter all the information when fueling at the pump I can do it all from the cab on the app and only enter the 6 digit number into the pump and fueling is so much easier. It‚Äôs great when it‚Äôs cold raining or windy. Give it a try once and you will never go back that is unless that App is down. Stay Safe Drivers!	positive
1231	474259675	travel	3	I entered my card information into the app, yet whenever reserving parking I am taken to a web page requiring me to enter my card again! Why can‚Äôt this be fixed to provide a quicker option that is more user friendly? After all, time is a factor when looking for parking! The competitor‚Äôs app has its own issues, but at least I‚Äôm not forced to dig out the card and enter info every time I use their app.	positive
1232	474259675	travel	2	Since the update to the new layout of the app, the location is hardly ever accurate, you are unable to see if there are any showers available, you cannot reserve showers from your phone. The only plus about this app is that I‚Äôm still able to see my points and can still fuel from the app. Other than that, been having nothing but problems with the new update. I‚Äôve tried to delete and re-download the app and if anything that made it worse.	negative
1233	474259675	travel	5	This app has improved in some respects, like showers and the wallet, but the location directory needs a re-think. The automatic zoom feature makes it useless. Frustrating.

1235	474259675	travel	3	I‚Äôm having an issue with the mobile app. All information is in the app that‚Äôs needed.

I had a plot me a route and it put me on a ferry boat across Lake Michigan. :-( There did not seem to be any way to change my route to Interstate 80 which is the easiest route to drive. It‚Äôs kind of nice that they show fuel prices but if it doesn‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going then it‚Äôs completely useless"	negative
1239	474259675	travel	4	Love the app but to make it 100% useful it would be nice if it told you miles to location when you touch the information icon.

This makes it harder to plan trips.	positive

Another time I figured double points? Why not I‚Äôll but fuel with the app. Everything worked this time(which isn‚Äôt always true) and a big fat 0 points added to my card. None!

Retrying never does any good.   Almost always this error goes away after updating the app.   That‚Äôs poor wording on the error message.   It‚Äôs also sloppy coding on app in that it must seek an external data source to open. -2

Truckers (for whom this app is intended) often go places with no access to Internet even in this day and age.  Not having an offline mode is a serious handicap. -1

The marking nonsense and sales based notifications I can deal with though they are on the excessive side. -1

All in all, this app is decent if you never leave the big cities.  A more robust offline mode that doesn‚Äôt nuke your login (yet another bloody password to remember) would cure my first two gripes."	negative
1250	621574163	utility	4	In albums there should be a feature where you can change your most recent uploaded pictures to be at the top on the album. It used to be this way. It has changed. Now all my recent pictures are at the bottom in the albums I‚Äôve created and its a pain to scroll down 200 pics all the way to the bottom to see if I added it to the album. Please change this feature or at least add a feature for date taken or uploaded within the albums created. I know there is a feature like this under all the pictures taken but not in the albums. Please add this feature. Also, I‚Äôve noticed when I add an article that I have screen shotted with my phone and add it to my albums of saved articles, it uploads in the album backwards. I get the last page of the article 1st in the album instead of last. The first page is at the bottom, not at the top. This feature definitely needs to be changed.	positive
1251	621574163	utility	4	"As a photographer I love that this allows me to store high quality RAW files from the camera without having to pay for expensive cloud storage outside of my Prime membership!! Really awesome as other services do not store the full quality images. I also love the faces features and ability to search by what‚Äôs in the picture. 

I edit most of my photos on iPad so its great as I can just import them from camera and back them up here and my hard drive. 

There is ONE THING that is super annoying and should be fixed- the ability to multi select or select all. I dont want to back up every single item in my photos just the RAW photos and edited versions. So I have to manually select each photo which is so many when I do a shoot with 400 images for example. If I could hold and drag to multi-select or create albums in iPhone photos and choose ‚Äúselect all‚Äù it would make using this app a million times easier."	positive
1252	621574163	utility	3	"* Review updated

I started using the app after several days which were necessary to upload all the photos from my phone. There are definitely nice features. I like that the app offers you to look at the pics that were taken on the same day previous years.
My biggest disappointment, however, is that the app backs up pictures as soon as they are taken (if wi-fi is available) and doesn‚Äôt update them if they are being edited. I take quite a few pics a day and, at the end of it, I edit the best of them. If they were baked up some time earlier in the day, they remain unchanged. 
I was hoping that Prime Photo could be a free (well, I pay for prime either way) substitute of iCloud, but, unfortunately, it can‚Äôt. As soon as I get a new phone, am I supposed to edit a couple thousand pics again?!

***
I haven‚Äôt really started using the app yet, but I‚Äôm already frustrated. I have lots of pictures on my phone - around 8 thousand. I know it takes time to copy/back them up, but not that much! The app was running a few hours at night and several hours in the morning, it managed to back up only a half! My phone barely works when it‚Äôs running and they want you to keep the app open for it to work faster which means I can‚Äôt use my phone at all. I stopped myself from deleting the app several times already. I hope in a few days it‚Äôs gonna download all the pics so I could finally check out all the features."	positive
1253	621574163	utility	3	So far, it is difficult for me to properly rate the app. I have been trying to back my photos up for a couple of days.  I have just over 12,000. I left the app open overnight last night and woke up with 491 photos remaining to back up.   I needed to send a quick text message, so I switched over to messaging, sent my message and promptly returned to the photo app.  The count went back up to over 12,000 and the app now is ‚Äúchecking for backup‚Äù, counting down in the same fashion as when I started the process last night.  As an added service to something I already pay for (Prime), it‚Äôs tough to complain but it isn‚Äôt doing what I need it to yet, so I need to maintain middle ground until I have some indication that it will ever back up my photos.  It doesn‚Äôt do any background uploading, wifi or not, and I can‚Äôt just leave the app open all day.  Each time I go back into it now, it starts over.	negative
1254	621574163	utility	4	"One thing would make this a 5 star review: Would love it if the picture was removed from the main photos page when you add it to an album.  OR at least, the app needs to clearly show if the picture has been added to an album.  Currently, there is no way to know which pictures I have placed in albums.  This is very annoying when you have a thousand pictures to organize.  

Otherwise, love the unlimited storage of the ORIGINAL PICTURE SIZE with Prime membership!!!  It‚Äôs TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!  I‚Äôm just waiting for them to take that away (please don‚Äôt take it away).  Was using paid Dropbox, but I don‚Äôt have enough room to upload at original pic size (although Dropbox gives you a lot of storage, pictures are large!).  This is a wonderful membership perk and well worth it!"	positive
1255	621574163	utility	4	"I shoot a lot of pictures so I need a lot of back up space. The unlimited space provided by this app provides an additional piece of mind for all my shots. 

The interface is a bit clunky and is a major memory hog. 

The other issue I have encountered is that it is no longer recognizing my canon raw files after processing them through Lightroom (CR2 files). The problem just started in the last month so I am not sure the issue. However this would be a major negative if it can‚Äôt store canon raw files. 

It‚Äôs by no means perfect. The information and instruction on use is lacking which in my case lead to a major error. In one case, I eliminated a folder on prime, only to discover that that action also deleted the original file on the hard drive. Luckily I had the raw files still on the memory card. 

In summary, if you are a prime member, you should absolutely use it. It‚Äôs another way to back up your pics at no cost. 

However if I had to pay for the service, I don‚Äôt think I would, at least not with current functionality. 

In conclusion, I feel like an ingrate complaining about a free service that I am using!  From a value perspective, I rate it 4 out of 5."	negative
1256	621574163	utility	4	I use prime photos to back up all my photos from all devices. This app makes it easy to view my whole library from my phone or iPad. It is also very simple to upload photos directly from my devices. Several years ago there was a sync function on the app version of prime photos that could make it easy to accidentally delete pictures from prime photos when you deleted them from your phone. That sync feature, as far as i can tell, has been removed from the app, so you can use prime as a simple backup rather than a mirrored drive like iCloud or 365. The sync version still exists when accessing prime photos through your browser, such as you would on your computer, but even there i turned it off.	positive
1257	621574163	utility	2	I really love your app except two things...one is a long-standing complaint, that exif info including time&date&location, does download with pictures.   The second is a new development since recent update.   The ‚Äúadd to favorites‚Äù is right above the ‚Äúadd to album‚Äù tab.   I‚Äôve been careful only to hit add to album, and for some reason, it makes the whole album ‚Äúadd to favorites‚Äù and I can‚Äôt figure out how to remove that designation for one photo, let along a newly created album that has over 1,000 photos&videos...also, why isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúadd to album‚Äù on the top but you put it on the bottom?

Then I learned about this program.  It is so easy because it does all the work.  You don‚Äôt have to sit there saving pictures from one source to another. I told  it to save the pictures that were on my tablet and within minutes it saved over 1000 pictures while I watched a movie. It adds any new pictures you take them automatically and you can edit pictures you have duplicates of etc.  I think you‚Äôll love it.	positive
1259	621574163	utility	5	k Its been real helpful so im sharing my thoughts, Ive been moving plenty since I was 15 y/o and I tried to keep storing on different platforms, and still the softwares seem to not take in account that is really thin percentage of world population that can afford the devices and web speed that u need to navigate all the options for this function of the internet(storage) desides thst. yeah it is a tiny bit less frustrating than  apple and clud n so on. also remember that if you get account canceled ull lose ur stuff, but u can share a family vault so u got a backup and also two account with prime so u do get a sorta sense of privacy wich is pretty good. so yeah four stars.	positive
1260	621574163	utility	4	With a prime membership this app is included, it has lots of storage space, but lacks in keeping up with recent photos.  I have my photos in this app to scroll across my tv screen as a screen saver and I have seen photos pop up that I do not have anymore and had forgotten all about, they are very random. In which it is nice to see surprise photos but I‚Äôm more concerned with recent photos I have taken and they are there floating around in space somewhere.  It is good to have for a extra backup, especially when my iPhone is constantly telling me to pay more for storage, not this gal, I will use other apps to save my photos that I can access anytime similar to this app.  All in all I would recommend it	positive
1261	621574163	utility	5	That‚Äôs a true statement, let me tell you why. All the other photo clouds tell you that they saving us disk space by backing up our photos and saving them all in their clouds. Not true! They copy our photos , but when we erase our original photos from our devices they also get deleted from the clouds. They are not supposed to be just copying our photos, they are supposed to be saving them after we delete them from our devices. Otherwise where are we saving any space on our devices? This is the only one that I found that actually lets you delete photos from your devices and safely saves your originals. Therefore actually freeing up our disk space. Great app!	positive
1262	621574163	utility	2	"This is almost a great program. However, it falls short in a number of crucial ways.

Firstly, there is no way to correct the many mistakes the facial recognition software makes. When it fails to recognize that an image contains a person, I can‚Äôt manually tag it. What‚Äôs worse, it frequently misidentifies two or three people as being the same person, and there‚Äôs no way to manually disambiguate. This is an essential function that must be added, and which competitor programs already have.

Frustratingly, the facial recognition 'People' folders index only the photos uploaded by your own account. They leave out all the photos of the same people in the family vault. So it‚Äôs not a very useful compilation of all the photos of somebody.

Thirdly, while this app allows manual album creation, your albums are stored only on your own account, and are not visible to anyone you add to your family vault. It‚Äôd be a huge bonus to be able to share albums with your family members.

I‚Äôd also really appreciate being able to rotate a photo right in my account, without having to download it to my device, rotate it in a separate program, and re-upload it to prime photo all over again. 

With a few fixes, this can be an excellent photo storage program."	positive
1263	621574163	utility	3	Overall, this is a pretty good photo app for those looking for an alternative photo App, which also contains decent editing and storage features. It does have annoying aspects to it as well, such as not being able to default to a selected Album, nor the ability to lock individual Albums. (Unless all pics are placed in the Hidden Photos section, which somewhat defeats the purpose) A few annoying bugs when it comes to storage or organization. E.g..Pics selected as Album covers are lost the moment you move new photos into that particular albums. Tech support is a little disappointing. Quick to respond, however not quite attentive to questions, issues or problem solving. Kinda felt like Robo Support. My suggestion would be to try before you buy!	positive
1264	621574163	utility	5	I love the ease of use, the features offered have wonderful quality and as above are again easy and fun. I like that it backs up when you open it...and theirs so many ways to organize photos and videos and many options of what to do with them. Size of storage is reasonable and I have so many gigabytes of media not even close to maximum and I‚Äôm in the double digits. I do wish that when you‚Äôre uploading a lot of photos and such that you could do other things. Apparently you have to leave the application open for uploading. But the WONDERFUL QUALITIES of the app make up for it undoubtedly. I love this app and DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LOVES PHOTOS AND VIDEOS AND NEEDS A NO FUSS PLACE TO STORE THEM!!! Kid friendly...	positive
1265	621574163	utility	4	I really appreciate the ability to easily backup my photos.  I also like the idea of it recognizing people; however that feature definitely needs work.  The app routinely ‚Äòrecognizes‚Äô non-facial things as people.  If I go in manually and remove whatever name it has attributed it to, it simply chooses another person.  There really needs to be a way to tell it that isn‚Äôt a person.  I would also love a way to categorize photos by subject matter (places, pets, etc), so I could easily find a photo I was looking for.  Most other apps I‚Äôve used have these abilities.  All that being said, I can‚Äôt complain too much, as it‚Äôs unlimited photo storage and comes included with Prime.	positive
1266	621574163	utility	3	I like the program overall so don‚Äôt get me wrong.  I like that it can recognize faces and place those photos under the correct person you have named.  The problem is that every once in a while it places the wrong photo under the wrong person.  That in itself is not the issue as no software is full-proof in this regard and it is to be expected.  The issue stems from the fact that that once this happens, you have NO way of moving that photo to the appropriate person‚Äôs folder and can be quite frustrating.  If I‚Äôm missing something here, I would appreciate some hints on how to correct but till then that flaws appears to be this app‚Äôs Achilles heel.  I would have given it a higher rating to be sure if not for this serious shortcoming!	negative
1267	621574163	utility	4	"This app works wonderfully 90% of the time.  Open it up, it automatically scans phone and saves all photos and videos, then you have great access to your entire library wherever you go!  However every once in awhile it will get stuck. Like really really stuck. Will need to delete app and re-download. This is an excruciating process because then it needs to scan the whole photo library again. Another issue is it will ""miss"" videos (usually not photos) in the auto scan that you will have to manually upload. Overall I love the ease and functionality. My husband and I log onto the same account and can see all our pics in one place."	positive

I wasn‚Äôt particularly thrilled that the invites were only sold by increments of 25, and disappointed that I was short shipped [received fewer than 25], upon arrival.  The convenience of the service seemed attractive to me when I started the project, but I think I expected the turn around to be a little faster since  I took care of the ‚Äútype-setting.‚Äù

1269	621574163	utility	3	I wasn‚Äôt even aware that I had this feature from Prime which is a cost saver & bonus. I use an iPhone that really needed more space so I just wanted to store them easily rather that purchase additional cloud space. This task became so laborious. My app timed out several times. It really could not cope with uploading, verifying & deleting more than 50 pics at a time. I went to bed leaving it to upload only to become more confused as to which pictures I could delete off iPhoneüôÅ. I‚Äôm still doing it 3 weeks later because it keeps timing out. So now I have to keep going back & forth between app & pics b4 deleting. As one reviewer commented ‚Äúit‚Äôs FREE‚Äù. Oh, I forgot, the above comments does not include uploading videos. I am too scared to start if pics took so long.	negative

I have filled up 3- 20 Tb drives-yes terabyte. Don‚Äôt judge me. I keep seagate paying those fat dividends. So the idea of being able to archive all my photos in the cloud for free-I‚Äôm in. Easy and mostly automatic uploads. Easy to browse. Kind of fun blasts from the past. As I am still not over the loss of thousands of pictures from an accidental repartition if a 20TB vault a year ago ( deep deep sob) this is a balm on my damaged psyche. Privacy? Over rated. If somebody wants to browse my dogs and trips to Europe and secret prototype robots ( ok not the robots) then it‚Äôs fine.	positive

Recognition of faces and objects is is a key feature for organizing photos and for finding that one photo you‚Äôre looking for. 

Only one thing is missing - file structure. The folders need to be organized to replicate the file folders on the PC. There needs to be folders and sub-folders. Otherwise it‚Äôs hard to find the one folder labeled, ‚Äúcropped‚Äù when it could be a subfolder  of Bob or Tom or Vacation, e.g.  All the ‚Äúcropped‚Äù folders are bunched together and you can‚Äôt tell them apart without looking. Fix that and it‚Äôs a 5 star product!!"	negative
1272	621574163	utility	5	This app keeps all your photos safe by uploading them to the cloud so that if your device is lost or destroyed, you won‚Äôt lose them. Your photos are available through the app at any time you have connectivity, so you can access ALL your photos from your phone at any time without using up your storage space. My favorite features are the automatic upload from both my phone and desktop, and the ability to search by person, subject (like ‚Äúdogs‚Äù) or date. I would like for it to be easier to save a set of pictures to a folder or album on my device	positive
1273	621574163	utility	4	You have so many well-written reviews by people that value this app, but also have valuable suggestions as to how to make it better. Have you paid attention to your customers and taken note of their critiques?  Many of them have already mentioned things I would change and those reviews are from months ago. Right now, my biggest issue is the time it takes to download my photos. I will keep using it because the storage is free with prime. I would suggest listening to your customers in order to make this a better app and you might actually get more customers that don‚Äôt just use it because it‚Äôs free with prime. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Just sayin‚Äô.	positive
1274	621574163	utility	4	Great value all around for Prime Members.  Two problems keep it from being my go to photos app (Google photos still has it beat unfortunately) 1) It needs to work in the background to auto upload photos...don‚Äôt understand why it can‚Äôt because Google photos does perfectly 2) In order to make Family Vault work we need to absolutely be able to see each other‚Äôs people tags and places otherwise it is half a solution (or at least make that an option to check off if privacy is a concern).  Right now only I can see the people tags for my photos and wife can only see hers in our own accounts and not in the Family Vault.	positive
1275	621574163	utility	4	I love having the ability to share with family, having everyone‚Äôs first grandchildren and twins. I was always having to send so many texts and emails. Now I can send out one group texts to check the app. Family can buy their own prints or whatever other custom item they want. They one reason I would give it four stars and not five would be, my husband and I share the same account so that we have each other‚Äôs pics and their is some lag on my iPhone vs his Samsun. He can instantly see my downloads but it takes a bit longer for me to see on my phone his adds even though if I go on his phone I can clearly see them their.	positive
1276	621574163	utility	5	"Amazon/Prime photos is fantastic! It‚Äôs unlimited photo storage with customizable settings. 

I have my account set to automatically sync every time I open the app while on Wi-Fi. Pictures sync on all of my devices, as well as my wife‚Äôs, allowing us to retrieve photos anywhere there is Wi-Fi connection. This includes viewing them on TV (smart TV).  

This also allows me to share with other family members. Although video storage is not unlimited, the space is still significant enough for us to record our childrens middle school/high school concerts and send & share with family living out of state."	positive
1277	621574163	utility	2	After I turned on Prime Photos on my phone, I connected my iPhone to my computer and tried to import my photos into Lightroom.  Lightroom did not recognize any of the photos for import that had copies saved in Prime Photos. It was like my phone was empty, even though my photos still show on my phone. So, while Prime Photos sounds like a great idea for cloud storage, it will screw up any photographer‚Äôs workflow who uses Lightroom. Now I‚Äôm trying to find instructions for downloading my photos from Prime to my computer, so I can import them in Lightroom. All kinds of tips on putting photos into Prime, but still looking for how to retrieve the full res copies. That should be a basic function of cloud storage: retrieving your photos from the cloud.	positive
1278	621574163	utility	1	Unable to transfer a previous folder directly to the app. It has the ability to sort the photos by the date taken, whether or not there are people in the photos etc. But for some reason if you have an album created on it, it does not recognize it. Therefore the ONLY way to recreate an existing album is to manually add every single photo individually. Which in some cases is almost an impossible tasking, sifting through thousands of photos to recreate something that already exists and can be transferred by a click if they enabled that function. It seems like a simple tool as most photo apps sort the photos by the albums they‚Äôre already in, not the current date. Also the app does not save the photos when it is not open.	positive
1279	621574163	utility	5	"This is an excellent way to back up your iPhone photos, which will otherwise quickly eat up your 5GB cap on free iCloud storage.

I suggest setting automatic backup of pictures BUT NOT videos, as videos count against your 5 GB cap on free storage. Not so your still pictures, or even Live Photo‚Äôs! Save individual videos to Prime Photos to manage that 5GB cap.

Back up is not automatic; you have to have the Prime Photo app active on your phone, and ‚ÄúAuto-Save‚Äù enabled in settings, for the backup to take place. Again, in settings, I suggest you keep the ‚ÄúVideos‚Äù switch (for auto-save) set to off.

Photos can easily be moved to an album and filtered by date; the date of a photo (say, that you download from something someone else posted) can be edited to match the date of the event. The only major feature missing is the ability to add a short caption to a specific photo in your collection or album."	positive
1280	621574163	utility	4	I love this app as a secondary backup for my photos. However, due to the limitation on video (all non-photo files in fact) space, I still need another backup method and keep another copy at home on my hard drive. In addition, I wish this app would not rename all of my files with completely different and very long names! I understand the need to avoid duplicate file names caused by the standard systems used on devices, but it would really be nice if the original IMG-xxxx name could be kept with just a short addition to make it unique. This is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 on my rating.	positive
1281	621574163	utility	1	"I have found Prime Photos incredibly frustrating to use, for the following reasons:
1. It offers the ability to place photos in albums, but there is no way to click on a given photo and quickly check what, if any, albums it already belongs to. You have to go to the album and look through it to check. This makes the album feature useless as far as I'm concerned.
2. I have not been able to set this app to automatically back up photos in external storage on my phone. Apparently the automatic backup feature only works if you save your photos to internal storage.
I like that Prime Photos provides unlimited cloud backup, but as a photo management app it has some serious deficiencies. I will come back and give it five stars if they are fixed."	neutral
1282	621574163	utility	3	I like that all my pics are instantly backed up and stored and I never have to worry about losing them. I do wish you could order prints and i wish searching for a specific pic was easier. Also, it seems to take longer for my pics to download to prime photos than my other photo app, in which pics are instantly dropped in. I got the prime photo app so I could access the photos instantly from anywhere as long as I was on my prime account, but i haven‚Äôt been able to figure that out yet. All in all, I have better luck with my other photo app- i just keep this app for extra back up for my photos and for video storage	positive
1283	621574163	utility	5	I have never used an app that has had the capabilities to keep all my photos thru my many different changes of iPhones, computers and iPads. I don't have to save to cloud it must do it automatically . I would love to purchase one of the albums but never seem to have the time to organize my thoughts but that is a great option also . Also other ones that if you take a quick look you will see they have several different things to choose from. Updates seem to be done on a pretty good frequency which I like also.	positive
1284	621574163	utility	3	This is a great app considering now more than ever we take photos of everything. With that being said the unlimited amount of photos that can be uploaded is as plus+++++. However, the time it takes for them to upload isn't as great. Also I'd like the idea of not having to have the app open in order for them to upload, that prevents me from multitasking which is a major minus-----. Also, it would be nice if the app once downloaded and recognize the faces of the ppl we have already set to a folder, would go to that folder automatically if that photo is a single of that person. Other than that this is a great app!!!	positive
1285	621574163	utility	4	"I love this app and the services that it offers. I appreciate that it exists and provides a reliable, unlimited, user friendly way to back up pictures. The one and only reason it is not 5 stars for me is that I would like to have a setting that keeps the uploading priority highest, even when I only have the app going in the background. Alternatively or in addition I would like to have a setting option that allows my phone to automatically upload my photos in the middle of the night, when by bandwidth is less taxed and in demand. In my area DSL is the fastest connection available, and since I often do not remember to turn on the Prime Photos App, often times when I am uploading it is hundreds (or thousands!) of photos at a time. 

So to recap through all those run on sentences; Dear Prime PTB, 
Please add
‚Ä¢ A priority setting re: upload speed while the App is in the background
and/or
‚Ä¢ An automatic scheduled upload/backup option

Thanks!

I don‚Äôt pay for the iCloud photos backup due to a 1.5 Tb library of Raw photos from DSLR‚Äôs and videos from iPhone. The time between manual syncs leaves a gap of potentially lost data in case of damaged or lost phone. So, letting this app pickup the captures in between is value added piece of mind. Plus the extra screen captures and daily snaps of deposits or grocery lists don‚Äôt need to be saved in the roll once this is synced but can be useful if needed later."	positive
1287	621574163	utility	4	"I use to have folders and folders of photos saved to a computer desktop growing up. Times are changing and I don‚Äôt have time to sit down and upload them to my laptop anymore. While it‚Äôs nice to still have that option, being able to upload photos on-the-go is a lot more desirable. And my photos can stay somewhere safe rather than on my phone.

The app is nice and clean. Easy to navigate. Does the job I was expecting. I do have one suggestion though regarding photo organization. 

Would there ever be a consideration to allow sub-albums inside of albums? For example: An album called ‚ÄúVacations‚Äù, and inside that album could be other albums like ‚ÄúDisneyland 2018‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew York 2019‚Äù, ‚ÄúBahamas Cruise 2020‚Äù, etc. That way I can more easily navigate which folders I want to get to. I‚Äôll know my vacation photos are in one album, hiking photos in another, work events in another, and so on. 

So far I‚Äôm enjoying the app."	positive

Seamless automatic uploads, Flexibility with downloads including full native resolution that photos were taken (alternative services like Shutterfly do not let you download the native resolution of the photos in order to force you to order prints through them). Finally it syncs across devices quickly, So I can take a photo on my SLR camera on loaded on my computer and sync the photos to my phone in a matter of minutes.	positive
1289	621574163	utility	4	Love having this app although I‚Äôve had to remove it and add it back again to keep working correctly. Samsung doesn‚Äôt have this problem, which is my only complaint. They got better about using cellular data finally. This was our biggest issue with a family divided between apple and Samsung. If you have problems downloading your pics, just delete the app, and try again. Takes a bit going through pics, but gets it right after that. Have the same issue, do it again. Hopefully, the developers will get it right.	positive

Not sure if there is some degradation of quality but if you‚Äôre concerned about that you prolly should be keep them backed up on your own media. For my purposes it works great. Love it. We have over 23,000 pictures that were on a single drive. I was always afraid that we might lose them. Now they are all safe and I still have my original drive with them. Perfect!	positive
1291	621574163	utility	5	I have been pretty impressed with the ease of use of the app.  I have had no problems with syncing between the app, the ‚ÄúI‚Äù products and my Windows computer.  The photos transfer very quickly.  My only issue was with my videos filling up the allotted space.  I know there is a fix for this but I haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to check it out yet. I purchased more space but for Prime users the price is right.  I used to use Google Photos and dropped them to take advantage of this app.	positive

My only complaint is I really wish it had more video storage, but the photo storage is incredible!	positive
1293	621574163	utility	5	Worked really good with the app on the TV. As long as you have good WiFi or data connection it uploads pretty quick. I like the fact that you can choose to hide certain pictures so people can‚Äôt see them without the pin or password. Easy to use, works well . You can choose whether or not to upload photos automatically or to only send certain ones if your using the app on your smart TV or Firestick or whatever. Really great editing system as well. Definitely a 5 out of 5	positive
1294	621574163	utility	5	The fact that there would bea app were you could relive your memories as kids or of you or of your kids is great. The whole central idea around is great, any picture you take goes straight to the cloud which they should fix. Also the dates are off because for me it says it‚Äôs 2037üòÇ. This could be annoying because you would want to remember these exact days and there date. Overall this app is great for the family and I highly recommend it.	positive

I do have a few ways you could make this app even better though: it would be great if you could choose your own faces to add instead of labeling the ones they give you, and it would be great if you could actually take photos on the app. Thanks and I really love this app!"	positive

1298	621574163	utility	3	"As others have pointed out, the app uploads photos as soon as they are take but not after they have been edited in your computer or other device. This makes the app pretty useless for anyone who does more than just take snapshots. 

It would help if there were just a switch to turn off that auto upload feature. That is not a hard thing to do from an engineering point of view. But, of course, it is possible users will then flip on that switch and start loosing their snapshots. The cries of dismay! 

So, I may have to reconsider my cloud storage options. There are no free lunches."	negative
1299	621574163	utility	5	I seriously am in love with this app! You can set for it to upload when opening the app. The only downfall is that you can‚Äôt close the app till it‚Äôs done or it will stop the uploading but if you have quick enough WiFi it only takes a minutes. I personally prefer it over icloud for the sake that if I delete the photos from my phone, the items stay in the app and you can have the app downloaded on multiple devices to access the pictures!	positive

I found a cellphone on the ground at the park and wanted to give it back to the owner but couldn't because it was all in Spanish, so I thought the translate from an image would help if I took pictures of the screen. It didn't work well at all, but that was fine... Not the part that makes them a scam. This is... 
I cancelled the app‚Äôs subscription immediately and it said canceled and that it would expire today, October 12th. Job should have been done, however I WAS STILL CHARGED the monthly fee.  
Since I went through and had canceled or already there was also no way to seem from getting charged in the future because the option to ‚ÄùCancel Subscription‚Äù on my phone had already disappeared because I had hit that button already. The only option was to ‚Äùrestore the purchase.‚Äù
I went through apples awful customer service web chat service and gave them all the information and order number, my info, etc and after the 10 minutes it took for her to grasp what I was saying and what I was asking for the app to definitely be canceled (again) AND a refund she said she would help me and then she never came back I waited 20 more minutes but she never did and said there was a ‚Äùconnection issue.‚Äù SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT.

She speaks and writes in English without issue, but most of her family and friends back home don't speak or write in English or feel more comfortable in Italian. iTranslate helps me understand Facebook comments about my sister-in-law or niece that I would otherwise be unable to read/translate (my Italian isn't that advanced). 
It also allows me to look at foreign websites and translate from the source language into English. My parents enjoy international travel and like to stay in small bed and breakfast type places instead of large multi-national hotel chains. Often these small B&B's website doesn't have an English version, so iTranslate comes to the rescue! 
I usually know what language I am translating from, but from time to time I will want to translate a tweet or FB comment that is written in a language I don't recognize. When that happens, it definitely comes in handy that iTranslate has the ""Detect Language"" function and can automatically translate it to English or another language of your choosing. 
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND using iTranslate!"	positive
1302	288113403	travel	2	"Initially this app would have gotten 5 stars. It beat google translate and a tu ally did a decent job translating English to German & vise versa; especially for a free app. But of late the app consistently crashes immediately after is finishes the cycle of translation; and before I have time to even verify it‚Äôs accuracy so not sure if it‚Äôs still as correct as it used to be I read in a some reviews that it isn‚Äôt anymore; i.e. Korean for example, but I wouldn‚Äôt know since it keeps crashing. Wrote to Support and will see what happens. Also asked me to upgrade which I strongly considered but not with some of the small print in permissions. Beware that it requires access to any past translations as well & beware that anything you type it paste into it to translate will be accessed by this app; so you might wish to leave out financial or sensitive Information, etc.; like if you‚Äôre translating a contract. Also, the premium (paid) version price tag seems rather steep to a lot of the reviewers here as well as to me the way it is organized now. 
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a bit of ‚Äúcarrot‚Äù app; ‚ÄúLookie what I got here! Okay now come and get it!‚Äù ...Once you start chasing it, it eludes you.

... If they make improvements and adjustments, I‚Äôll alter my review, but for I‚Äôll say, sadly, I‚Äôd pass!"	positive
1303	288113403	travel	1	Ok, look /listen...When I first got this app I thought it would be amazing and such a big help, and the possibility using it on my Apple Watch was a bonus; I was really looking forward to paying for it after my trial, buuut then I started getting wrong translations all over the place.  I want to know who is providing the translations for these words...cause this is nonsense.  I‚Äôm learning Korean and it kind of defeats the purpose of having a translator app, that provides the WRONG translations a lot of the time; I stopped using google translate for that same reason.  I get tired of having to look up the word online just to get the correct meaning, it‚Äôs frustrating.  When I look up words in the translator I am not typing in American letters, I am typing in ÌïúÍ∏Ä (Hangul), just to make sure that I get the correct translation.  I have even provided the corrected translations for some of the words I have looked up through the app, and surprise, surprise they are STILL wrong and haven‚Äôt been corrected; why have ‚Äúwrong?‚Äù A feature in the app if you are not going to take advantage of it, and correct what is effectively wrong...SMH.  Either way my money will stay in my pocket when it comes to even thinking about purchasing this app üôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.  Move on there‚Äôs nothing to see here.	negative
1304	288113403	travel	5	"I do not understand all of the negative reviews.  Translating any language perfectly requires near mastery of the language so take the time to learn whichever one or more languages you choose.  In the meantime I challenge you to find a better app than this one. I have used it throughout Europe and it has been invaluable well beyond the $40 I spent to upgrade to the pro version. Translating restaurant menus was worth that price alone.  The app continues to evolve and improve.  Tens of thousands of people are using the app. I don't find the responses to complaints caustic but merely informative.  Don't let the negative reviews prevent a purchase that can be very valuable. And if you want to use a free trial it may make sense to have a need for the program during that time period to fully test it. And no I do not work for the company, only a happy customer that is realistic and understands limitations of any language program.  I think translating ""get a life"" from English to any language might miss the intended meaning."	positive
1305	288113403	travel	1	"It‚Äôs so sad to see how this app has gone downhill when it used to be fantastic. They now charge an exorbitant amount comparatively (4.99 per month), and compared to other services it‚Äôs just not worth it. Not only that, but ‚Äúupdates‚Äù have mislead many subscribers to sign up for a paid account, when it looks like a normal update, I‚Äôm surprised Apple hasn‚Äôt put a stop to that? Also, many mistakes in translations can be found, and if you read replies from other users, you will see that this company either expects its users to find and fix its own software issues, and/or rudely denies complaints, and calls people liars. Also, adds that used to be silent banners are now frequent, loud and disruptive; especially when you are trying to concentrate on translating.
Also, now that I‚Äôve read how poorly this company has been treating other people with critiques is honestly shocking! 
I‚Äôm not sure if this app is under new ownership or management, but it‚Äôs not something I want to rely on with all the incorrect translations, newly added loud commercials and combative and disrespectful treatment of subscribers. 
After having this app for years, I‚Äôm now of to find something better. Too bad."	negative
1306	288113403	travel	1	"I would like to start this review by saying that the idea is really great. I would totally subscribe for the verb conjugations and the layout is very clean. 

However I noticed another review noting that the Korean translations are incorrect, something I also noticed when using the app. Í∞àÍ≤å does not translate to ‚ÄúLL‚Äù at all. ÂæíÁÑ∂ didn‚Äôt even have a translation and was just romanized in English to ‚ÄúTozenn‚Äù which is an incorrect romanization... Although I do see the option to input correct translations if they are wrong and I am not a developer, I feel that if you are trying to get people to use this as a translating app, you might want to hold off on some languages until they are fully developed and correct. 

As for the people who are saying iTranslate ‚Äúautomatically charges‚Äù and that the developer is accusing users of lying, I understand where you come from. But most apps do the same thing, advertising a free trial. They will charge you after the free trial, which I think is wrong and should be verified with the user before they assume you bought the PRO version, but you can always say you do not want to start a free trial. It‚Äôs a good idea to read everything before you just click next."	positive
1307	288113403	travel	3	Please note, I‚Äôm asking a lot from it. American living in Germany and using it in/for a German language course. My wife is German and also a English and German teacher. It‚Äôs been pointed out on more than one occasion ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt mean (xyz) at all...‚Äù when using or quoting this app. If you‚Äôre using it just to get around for a vacation, sure. Plus (at least in Germany) they‚Äôre very polite and (almost) everyone speaks English so they won‚Äôt point out this app has missed the mark. If you just want to find a the bathroom or get food and a beer, I‚Äôve used a free app that is a lot better for communicating. (if this is now free absolutely download it, but if not...). Remember I need to know ‚ÄúWie sp√§t ist es?‚Äù- is not - ‚Äúwhat time is it‚Äù (the app translation) but what it truly says which is ‚ÄúHow late is it?‚Äù so... For when you‚Äôre listening to someone speak or building sentences on your own later you‚Äôll think wie means ‚Äúwhat‚Äù and sp√§t means time (what/was - time/zeit). It‚Äôs not always wrong, but it‚Äôs not always 100% right for everyday/conversational usage. If you do download, remember wie may not be what.	positive
1308	288113403	travel	2	I really dislike apps that puts such a huge wall around their features they want you to pay before you get to use them. They make it seem like they are such gold you can‚Äôt even taste without paying. People don‚Äôt pay until they‚Äôre hooked they need to get you hooked on it first. And this apps‚Äô metric for measuring use in order to get you hooked is very weakly implemented. I signed up for the free trial when I downloaded the app so that I could use the features but I did not need them at the time so I never used the app until the trial expired. So in the end I never even tried it one time. That is a really dumb trial. The app needs to measure the use of the app and give you a trial based on actual use not some finite amount of time. Especially when translation is something you use when you need it not just on demand when the app tells you to use it. You don‚Äôt have something to translate until you have something you need translated! Bad design when it comes to trial. Focus more on user experience. Sadly I can‚Äôt even use the app so what can I do? Uninstall	negative
1309	288113403	travel	5	Wow. I have yet to try all of the features. It isn‚Äôt that the features are not beneficial... I am currently working to increase screen time (yes, increase). I didn‚Äôt like translation apps because of the undesired results. I guess this would be something I‚Äôll just state vaguely because I‚Äôd rather be doing something else but I encourage anyone interested in translation apps to try this one and buy the pro in-app version. That will make all of the apps in the bundle available with pro features. The user interface is simple, elegant and easy to use. The experience started out being very satisfied and continues to fuel the thirst for knowledge and provide the perfect amount of pleasure to be very ally with the product and want even more. I just found more so I‚Äôm going back in to nerdify  my life. More is more.	positive
1310	288113403	travel	1	"I was going to download this app bc we were spending a month in Europe, but after reading the reviews, Didn‚Äôt download. 
 The reason wasn‚Äôt mainly bc so many people were unhappy about too many & too loud of ads (altho that was a small part of he reason). The main reason was the defensive, rude responses the people who gave reviews got from the developers! I am appalled that they would be called liars. 
Developers: Why on earth do you think so many people would say the same thing? Why do you think they would make that up? Do you think you are endearing yourselves to customers (where you get your $ from) by being so caustic? I will tell you I believe your customers, not you. And so will virtually every body else. And I also noticed that absolutely nothing is a glitch in YOUR program. It‚Äôs all the customer‚Äôs problem., or someone else‚Äôs ‚Äòfault.‚Äô
Wow! Smart enough to create (what could be) a cool app, but too immature to know how to handle customer service courteously. Old saying: ‚ÄúYou can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar.‚Äù"	negative
1311	288113403	travel	5	"We used this app all over southwestern France which is way more rural and has fewer people that speak English! we were able to travel on our own without a tour service or a tour guide. we didn‚Äôt have too many barriers language wise. The few times we had an issue was pronunciation. Those times we were in a situation where we could not play the audible of what one of us was trying to say. For that $20 per year charge for verbal translation and being able to take a photo of something to translate, it can‚Äôt be beat! 
Because we cannot always play the sound, it would really be nice if there was a phonetic pronunciation included. I grew up speaking Spanish and tended to lapse into a Spanish pronunciation to an unfamiliar French word when I could not hear it or see how to pronounce it!"	positive
1312	288113403	travel	4	The app is pretty good. I haven‚Äôt seen any bugs or significant negative points. The interface is neat and easy to navigate. There‚Äôs no ads at the bottom of the screen but the pop-up ads could be less. Instead of pop-up ads, place the ads on the Phrasebook tab as an ‚ÄúAdditional features‚Äù kinda promo section. It can still be seen but it‚Äôs not an interference that‚Äôs shoved into your face while you‚Äôre in the middle of typing a sentence. Also, an option to make a  personalized added phrases list in the Phrasebook tab would be great. I have commonly used phrases that I‚Äôm sure are different from others‚Äô commonly used phrases. Being able to have those ready at hand will save time and efficiency, which are important when you‚Äôre lost or confused or need to give directions immediately.	positive
1313	288113403	travel	5	"The app is of great value and allows for practice for those who put in the time reading, saying, and listening. I like having access to the phrasebook necessity of languages. 
Traveling, class, and communicating personably or professional with this app is a plus. In writing this it was now time to pay monthly again, not having realizing 30 days had past. I had not used the app yet, but tested to see if it updated. The price it worth it depending upon usage. I did think 4.99 per month was pricey. Again usage determines the price. For me, based upon my usage I may subscribe periodically throughout the year, realizing the initial update fee was not for the entirety or year.
The app is a ‚Äúdiamond in the rough‚Äù, when you are somewhere needing to access the necessities within the ventures of travel."	positive
1314	288113403	travel	2	"Brief review-- This translate app was always fantastic. Little by little my free version has been adding more and more ads. I fully support the need for ads, and usually get the paid version when I can. 
Tonight was the last straw and I've deleted the app. I'm trying to look up a simple phrase, lying beside my mate, who is fast asleep, and suddenly (without warning or giving me any choice , a LOUD video ad starts blaring. I nearly jumped out of my skin. 
No more iTranslate for me... It'll have to be Google for me. Sad to have to leave, but I *never* want that to happen again.

Update: Developer says more ads isn't true, but...
I haven‚Äôt tried reinstalling, but I have to tell you that the kicker for me was this: 
I was using iTranslate while lying up in bed with my partner fast asleep next to me‚Ä¶ SUDDENLY and very loud and jarring there was a VIDEO ad‚Ä¶ which made me jump out of my skin‚Ä¶ and woke my partner. I have NEVER before seen a video ad in your app. Ever. So, you may not have increased the occurrence of ads, but this (video ads) is most definitely new to me - and I‚Äôve had your app for years. Was it just my luck that this never occurred before? 

And I think you folks need to fix those videos so users have an option to mute. Until I know that this could never happen again, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be using iTranslate. It really was rather dramatic."	negative
1315	288113403	travel	2	"i have a Peruvian related family where my mother and I has a similar bloodline to them. there was a Facebook post my cousin made and she‚Äôs Peruvian. So I end up using Mexican language to translate but I couldn‚Äôt find her language üòü. Instead I brought myself to the usual Mexican translation. I wanted to comment on her but I want to make sure I‚Äôm fluent in their language so they can understand. So, I typed my words to translation of what I wanted to comment, which is a little joke. So I thought it could go well! WRONG.

my mother had told me that the comment came out as an insult, not a joke. I tried to say it the way I want it to be said but instead I had to go back to her post and delete my comment. ‚òπÔ∏è 

Mainly it was my fault, I wish to respect your app but I am really disappointed that this app does not have any additional Hispanic languages. Not saying this app is uncultured, but I would wish more for it to adapt to change. I‚Äôm just saying."	negative
1316	288113403	travel	1	"Since I keep getting spammed to try out your 7-days trial every time I open the app I will do just that. But if your paid options aren‚Äôt better than free apps and you keep prompting me to upgrade after the trial is over, I will be done. 

I understand you‚Äôre making your money selling subscriptions, but the service you offer is just not worth paying every month for; especially with Google Translate around. And as a ‚Äòbasic‚Äô user what I care about when launching iTranslate is a quick access to the main tool. Unfortunately your welcome page prompting me to go pro is always in the way; unlike your dismiss button that is hidden away from reach. 

[Update on original review], 

The trial is over, and I still receive the ‚ÄòTry 7 days‚Äô screen on app startup... so no way of turning that screen off. I‚Äôm deleting your app. 

And thanks for the condescending developer response, but had you actually cared you would have realized that my main issue wasn‚Äôt my understanding of what ‚ÄòPRO‚Äô features are. But rather the fact that I get prompted to ‚Äòtry 7 days‚Äô every time I decide to use your app! And cherry on top, the dismiss icon is a tiny little x located in the most unreachable spot of the screen, that is barely even visible so it‚Äôs transparency is high. 

Either you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing, or you know precisely what you‚Äôre doing... and I don‚Äôt take you for fools. Shame on you!"	positive
1317	288113403	travel	1	I may not be fluent in too many languages, though I do know enough to get through small talk. It seems pretty difficult to find a good online translator that can actually distinguish the usage of nouns and conjugations in actual conversation or even just sentence usage. These apps need to reprogrammed by those who are fluent in these languages to properly give those of us still learning a better understanding of how to say what we wish to say. I tested some things I know in languages such as German, Gaelic, Italian, and even Latin to see just how accurate this and other apps are and so far they are to quite a degree incorrect. These apps seem too focused on a literal dictionary translation instead of how the words are actually formed together in a true spoken sentence. I‚Äôd like to be able to better use this app to translate phrases and conversation I don‚Äôt yet know so hopefully sometime soon the administration of this app catch on to the lack of real life accuracy and fix this.	positive
1318	288113403	travel	2	"I was excited to get the app initially. It did help make some translations. I translated a few phrases (while on WiFi) and screenshot the display so that it could be used as we were out. Of course the issue was that I could not predict what conversations would come about. So I did the trial for ‚ÄúOff-Line‚Äù Translations. When I used it out and off line, the Japanese did not understand it; could not read it, and expressed ‚Äúit made no sense‚Äù. Therefore, the off-line version did NOT work. As I used the same pre-recorded phases (when in WiFi) there was no problem. The Japanese laughed as they understood my punchlines effortlessly.
Another issue was that the app did NOT recognize Japanese symbols. It displays that it only works when on WiFi- and yet when I used it; still no progress. Surely it was a let down for I needed it the most. Gotta cancel this app as soon as I get back home. It helped, but did not perform as designed."	positive
1319	288113403	travel	5	I used this app while visiting Colombia a few months ago. I was able to have a conversation with several people who spoke no English just by passing my phone around and letting it do the talking. I used it to read menus in restaurants, to order room service, and to give directions to taxi drivers. The people I interacted with really appreciated my attempts at communicating with them in their language, and it was so much easier to understand directions after they appeared in writing, rather than trying to keep up with rapid fire Spanish. Best of all, I could keep a record of the conversation for reference. No more, ‚Äúhere‚Äôs the church where we are supposed to turn, but I forgot whether she said to turn left or right‚Äù.	positive
1320	288113403	travel	2	"I downloaded this app because I read that it can be integrated with iMessages so I figured it would make things easier for me to translate languages directly from the iMessage app instead of copying and pasting into a separate translation app or website however, that is not the case. Yes, this app is integrated with iMessages and allows YOUR message to be easily translated within the iMessage app before sending but when someone responds to you in a language you wish to translate you will still have to copy and paste to know what they are saying, and you can do that for free with Google Translate instead of $4.99 a month. 

Suggestion: It would be better if the app was designed to automatically translate the other person‚Äôs text message without having to copy/paste or click on a bunch of buttons that apparently don‚Äôt work (the chat bubble button on bottom of keyboard)."	positive
1321	288113403	travel	4	"I would love to give this amazing app a 5 star review. The fact that it auto translates what you type pretty accurately compare-able to fluent speakers of translated language. I‚Äôm also very fond of the bubble that pops up when you copy text. Not having to leave the app to open another app just to do the translation, makes having conversations in two languages much smoother and fluid. 
However the reason I am doing s 4 star is because I‚Äôm currently experiencing a bug that I hope to bring light too or find out if it‚Äôs something that is being targeted currently. 
When you type too fast on the keyboard it will crash and reload the original Apple keyboard. It freezes as you type quite often as well. 
Again great app but just this one thing for now!"	positive
1322	288113403	travel	3	"So a couple of things I immediately noticed. The iMessage app keyboard is broken. You can‚Äôt type alternate characters (like ‚Äú√ß‚Äù) because the menu disappears when you move your finger to select them. It works if you install the actual iMessage keyboard, but not in the iMessage app.

I would really like to have the 3D touch cursor control enabled in the keyboard (firm press turns keyboard area into trackpad to move cursor in text field).

I speak english and the person I use this with speaks Portuguese. A lot of her messages to me are mixed language. If she sends me one that starts in English and then ends in Portuguese, then the copied message button performs an english->portuguese translation, which means I get no help from it. It would help to be able to reverse the translation direction so that the part I need translated actually translates."	positive
1323	288113403	travel	1	I purchased this app because I‚Äôm traveling Latin America for the next 6 months and was looking to use this as a tool while I‚Äôm learning Spanish. The voice recognition is frustrating, it takes a few tries to recognize the correct thing being said for English and Spanish. It also gives a different translation when spoken vs typed even though the spoken words show up exactly as typed. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt notice these errors during the week trial period and when I reached out to the developer they responded with rudeness and was very argumentative. They said that someone would need to speak punctuations for it to translate properly.  This is absurd. I have found another app that functions with accuracy when one is in a real life conversation. I‚Äôm ticked that I wasted $50 bucks on this crap and trying to figure out how to get a refund is proving to be worse than unraveling a spiderweb. Do NOT waste your money!	negative
1324	288113403	travel	5	I like the interactive lessons.  I also like the graded repetition. I have been doing daily lessons for 2 1/2 years and just recently upgraded to Duolingo Plus.  It is nice not having to watch ads or worry about having to refill my hearts if I make too many mistake or typos.  I do all of my lessons on my iPhone so typos and auto correct are a common source of errors. I don‚Äôt always catch errors if I am in a hurry. I have seen a lot of improvement in the program in the 2 1/2 years that I have been using it.  I love the stories, but I have finished all of them.  I‚Äôm looking forward to more.  Keep up the good work Duolingo Team!	positive
1325	288113403	travel	3	I heard about the app from a few friends and they told me to try it out. As a friend, I decided to check it out. Of course, I know two languages, English and Japanese. So, I was thinking I could find out if the translation are right. Even find a few new words myself. So I typed in some stuff in English. Guess what? They even got the simple ‚ÄòHello‚Äô in Japanese wrong! I mean, if you are learning Japanese, that is the first thing you learn. And yet, some people may think the is simply correct. They got others wrong, too. My friend has a trip overseas and so she tried getting a good translate app to learn a couple of words. Poor girl thinks that the words are correct. Even I know. Who is running it? Make a app that actually works. Not give me and others half way. Thank you for reading this.	positive
1326	288113403	travel	5	The update make it more easier to translate on keyboard version but one suggestion I wanted an easy way to change language in keyboard for example I speak Japanese and my friend is speaking English I will translate it to Japanese To english right? And if I wanna understand my friends language I gotta go scroll and scroll to change the language so maybe you could add the swap button so more easier to swap but only that 2 specific language you chosed and also 2 buttons to remove all types words and one button to bring back the deleted words I hope this helped many people including me thank you devs a big credit for you all!.	positive
1327	288113403	travel	5	I don‚Äôt ever write reviews, and I don‚Äôt even have the upgraded version of this app, but it has helped me immensely over the years. From translating French while taking a course at uni to Portuguese when I forget words in my own language. I love that the app doesn‚Äôt charge for the pronunciation feature. You can choose a female or male voice and even edit the speed at which each language is pronounced. That‚Äôs gotta be the coolest feature I‚Äôve personally seen on a translation app. The whole app is so smooth and easy to use, and it‚Äôs aesthetically simple and pleasing. To everyone who had a part in creating and releasing it, merci beaucoup!	positive
1328	288113403	travel	4	I saw the advertisement for iTranslate where one could speak in one language and the app would speak it in a target language, and vice versa. That looked very cool to me so I downloaded iTranslate and paid for the trial to try this feature. It really does work. I tried it for English to Chinese. Wow. Unfortunately, I downloaded iTranslate because I am visiting Bulgaria. It turns out that Bulgarian is not a spoken language yet for iTranslate.   This is the only reason I am giving this app four stars. I have no complaints about the app otherwise, and I fully understand that it takes time to build a large library of spoken languages. So take my four stars with a grain of salt. This could be the five star app you were looking for.	positive
1329	288113403	travel	2	I only downloaded this app because of a college course Spanish class. When i got the app it had barely been released on the app store & honestly the translations were pretty spot on! It WAS , WAS a good translator app, but now i don't I DO NOT recommend downloading this to only pay for it to work! This app never needed a subscription to work! Recently ive been noticing that every time i try to translate anything, The App SHUTS-DOWN PURPOSELY after every time a word or phrase is to be translated to the preferred language. For that i am removing this app after 6 yrs of having it on my phone. It was a great! WAS! Ridiculous how it shuts down now when i never had that problem. Now if i want a translation i have to pay!? Nope. Sorry, removed from my phone. I loved the app i honestly did just the whole having to pay for it to MAYBE work. Nah. Im good, ill stick to google.	positive
1330	288113403	travel	3	I loved it when I first got it but it got annoying because you have to pay for ALMOST EVERYTHING! If your in a different country and your trying to talk to someone who doesn‚Äôt speak the same language as you, you can‚Äôt use the app unless you have WiFi so if your in a part of town with no WiFi, then your just out of luck and you can‚Äôt communicate because you have to PAY just to use the app out of WiFi! Also if your in a different country and there‚Äôs a sign not in your language you have to pay to use the camera that translates words from signs  and papers and stuff. So if something says danger and you don‚Äôt speak the language of the sign then the sign doesn‚Äôt really matter to you even though it is important because you just have to pay.	negative
1331	288113403	travel	1	"Not only is this a terrible app with many mistakes (for example beets translates into beets in Spanish), but there is no way to cancel during the free trial.  (No cancel button). Nor is there a way to send a message to the developer (no ‚Äúsend‚Äù button.) you cannot cancel until you receive the receipt for the $49 subscription and then it is too late. You have been charged and attempts to request a refund are futile. Both my husband (who also signed up for the trial) and I filled out the request with a description of what happened. Immediately, within seconds of clicking the ‚Äúsend‚Äù button, we got a response saying that our request had been reviewed and didn‚Äôt qualify for a refund. This would be laughable if we weren‚Äôt already tearing our hair out in utter frustration. 

Btw, earlier today my husband  filled out a review with similar concerns. It has not been published. Not good."	negative
1332	288113403	travel	5	"I took Spanish classes for almost 15 years. Now that I‚Äôm not in school anymore, I‚Äôve become a little rusty. I don‚Äôt want to mess up my ability to speak fluent Spanish and the apps help tremendously. 

I use DuoLingo as a way to practice daily and level up. But sometimes I‚Äôll forget a word or phrase and the iTranslate app is nothing short of a blessing. I regularly converse with people in Spanish (as an attempt to maintain my skill) and it comes in VERY handy if you‚Äôre trying to use some level of American ‚Äúslang‚Äù. So it teaches you the correct terminology so that it makes sense in their language. 

LOVE THIS APP. 100% recommend."	positive
1333	288113403	travel	1	"I hate when you guys do that. How am I trying it if I have to pay for it in advance? What if I don‚Äôt have the money available at the time I want to try it? You should let the app be tested for free as a Free Trial version, as you mention. I don‚Äôt even know if I am going to like and then first thing I encounter when opening the App for the first time is a payment of $4.99/mo. Come on. That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. What if I forget to cancel the free trial if I don‚Äôt like it for some reasons or if there is a problem where I am unable to do the cancellation for any unexpected emergency reason. The developer should give us, the user, some time to try it and then block the free trial to give users an option to either pay for it or give it up. In my opinion, it‚Äôs tricky the way you do it.
I can‚Äôt even rate it because I never had a chance to try the Trial Version."	positive
1334	288113403	travel	4	I really love this app, it‚Äôs easy to use and extremely helpful when I travel. However I am disappointed that ONLY one (Arabic, -Egypt) language from the continent of Africa is available offline and has the voice feature. The other for the languages from the continent of Africa (< than 10 languages) do not have the offline availability or voice feature. In the next upgrade can the languages of Igbo, Swahili, Sudanese, Yoruba & Zulu be given additional features that some of the other languages have? This definitely would increase my usage of your app/recommendations to others who are also world travelers and have me purchase the pro feature again.	positive

*Reply to developer response.

Thanks for the reply, but that‚Äôs entirely not the case. I can‚Äôt access the pro features I paid for. I tried restoring purchases but your team must have changed the list of purchases available, removing the option I had paid for, even if it was recreated; as my purchases which do show in iTunes cannot be restored in your app."	positive
1336	288113403	travel	1	I used to swear by this app, I found myself using it more than google translate. I live and travel a rod roughy 9 months straight out of very year so I always need help with translation. The app was very handy and had features that I loved so much I‚Äôd recommend the app to every friend I have. Now, however, the translations are ALWAYS wrong. The widget copy/paste feature is awful as well and customer service was no help in trying to solve the problem. Customer service tried to suggest that I had done something to mess with the settings in my app, and that is why it wasn‚Äôt working. I‚Äôve never changed my settings or the way that I use the app, it‚Äôs 100% the developers problem and I‚Äôm beyond disappointed that this has gone on for so long. It‚Äôs been months that this has been happening and it doesn‚Äôt appear that they‚Äôre going to fix it.	negative
1337	288113403	travel	2	"I initially would have rated this app higher. I bought it some time ago and used it, then paid to purchase the Premium version. Now when I try to use it I cannot access the app. Instead I get a drop down menu pushing the purchase of the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù version for $4.99/month. There is a note that says ‚Äú restore purchases‚Äù which I assumed would restore my already paid for ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù version. It does not! Instead the buy- the- Pro version drop down menu continues and I cannot access the Premium version.
I have contacted developer on various occasions about the problem. They tell that yes I have the Premium version but they do nothing to give me access to it. The buy-  the- Pro at $4.99 that is automatically renewable forever continues. 
Beware of what your are getting into with this app!"	positive
1338	288113403	travel	2	I am using this app to translate from Italian to English and 1/3 times it won‚Äôt translate the word at all, instead it just repeats the same word I typed in English in the Italian box.  I‚Äôm typing things like ‚Äúlemon cake recipe‚Äù and ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù that got zero translation.  It also shows me a list of the English verb conjugations not the Italian ones. It seems more like a basic dictionary than a smart translator.  I checked my settings to confirm it understands I know English and am learning Italian - all the settings are right.  It‚Äôs also no longer working with my microphone and I‚Äôve had the app three weeks - just enough time for me to have paid for it.  This is very disappointing for the price.  I would recommend looking for another app if you want to translate anything complex like a recipe :)	positive
1339	288113403	travel	2	I bought this app, to have short, off-line exchanges in Japanese. It has only confused those with whom I have attempted to converse. The app is befuddled by plural nouns, verbs in past or future tense, commas, and many simple words, such as triple. Sentences are re-arranged, often rendering the opposite meaning. In order to say anything, I have to repeatedly translate my statement or question from English to Japanese, and back again, tweaking and simplifying it each time. To make matters worse, many of the most attractive features do not function without an internet connection, and voice translations are sent to Apple. They do not need any of my biometric data. In short, this app is useless to me, and the subscription based model makes it expensive. I do not recommend it.	negative
1340	288113403	travel	1	I‚Äôve bought this app the pro version long time ago, and it was like 3.99 and now the change the price and I can‚Äôt use the pro version because they trying to charge me 4.99 a month. Why? If I‚Äôve already or purchased the pro version, it‚Äôs is fair? If you guys changed the prices that‚Äôs not our problems, us who bought the pro version when it was cheaper have the right to have all the benefits of the pro version because that‚Äôs what we paid for long time ago.  How you guys think we‚Äôre gonna trust you? We can‚Äôt, we won‚Äôt. That‚Äôs stealing and forcing people to pay 2 times for something already pay. How‚Äôs is that you can‚Äôt find my account?

1341	288113403	travel	3	App itself is great. I‚Äôm docking two stars for stupidly high prices and the fact that every time I open the app, often at work in an attempt to quickly help a customer who doesn‚Äôt speak english, I have to wait for and close the prompt asking me to upgrade. I get that you want money, but I don‚Äôt use it enough to justify the $6/month or $50/year. Also, you already have tabs for paid features in the free app. Isn‚Äôt that enough to remind users that there‚Äôs more available, for a fee? You have to actually hinder their use of the app? Forget it. I‚Äôm looking for a different option, maybe with a reasonable one-time fee instead of an outrageous subscription. This app obviously isn‚Äôt for casual users.	positive
1342	288113403	travel	3	"I paid $5 for ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù a while back, and it does restore. Now there is a ‚ÄúPro‚Äù ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù that costs $5/month and apparently gives you the ability to translate to and from Mandarin (and some other tweaks).

I‚Äôm still not clear what fresh content this ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù translation level offers- are they building their own words or something? Not a fan of subscriptions in general, but makes sense for newspapers or other applications where you do need to continually update content or license external content (like Netflix). But to my mind this is neither- words are pretty well standardized at this point in history, and doubt this company needs to license words. $40-60/ year?!?

Good luck if they can make the subscription model work, I guess. Wish it was clearer what ‚ÄúPro‚Äù and ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù mean to them. Partly this is a problem with Apple‚Äôs formatting, they should have a standard hyperlink and insist that developers ‚Äúflesh out‚Äù exactly what benefits the different up-charges provide. 

For simplicity, I will look around for another app to buy that covers Mandarin-English on a 1-shot payment plan."	positive

I‚Äôm disappointed.

(For a good laugh and an example of what I‚Äôm talking about, check out the description of the spa AT A NICE RESORT where I‚Äôm staying: ‚ÄúThis massage person is going to be excessive.

So i downloaded this app because i saw camera translation and voice features that helps you chat with others. That was the main reason i got this. I was so Disappointed when I saw you have to pay for everything i needed. I know one time I got an ad saying i can use camera translation,  so of course i went  straight to the app. So i tested it out on a map of India, and took a picture of a word in Hindi, because i want to know what it meant. I was ready to translate it, then it stopped for some reason and took me back to the translation area. I tried going back to it, then it was like, haha you need to buy pro now. Google Translate is better.	positive
1345	288113403	travel	4	"This product has proven a clean & concise tool that quickly translates a multitude of differing languages; with your word swiftly translated into the language of choice. This does so rather swiftly as well which is always appreciated. My one qualm with this app is that it essentially suffocates you with ads and ‚Äúdeals‚Äù prior to being able to actually use the system itself. I suggest they find a perhaps different strategy; preferably one involving a less aggressive approach with these adds when essentially hold you hostage in certain scenarios. 

Other than my qualms with their approach towards ads, I overall enjoy this system and love using it."	positive

Plus, using and applying this app in such a context really assists in helping to facilitate beginning to learn these different languages. This is one of my top 3 favorite apps ever without a doubt.

Well it doesn‚Äôt allow you to, due to the subscription.  Though, of corse, there are some translate errors that might need to be looked into. If I put in ‚Äú¬øEst√°?‚Äù on one side, (using Spanish, of corse,) then flip it over, then flip it over again, (having ‚Äú¬øEst√°?‚Äù Where it should be, with what is, ‚ÄúIs it?‚Äù Or supposed to be, on the other side.) ‚Äú¬øEst√°?‚Äù is now ‚Äú¬ø¬ø Est√°?‚Äù.

1349	288113403	travel	1	"UPDTE: latest updates didn‚Äôt correct anything. All translations show some ‚Äúword‚Äù which is not even a real word! It is crazy that some simple word as ‚Äúengage‚Äù have that bunch of letters as translated word. What is the point of the translation software which don‚Äôt do it‚Äôs core function? Why they don‚Äôt write clearly ‚ÄúThis app will show correct translation ONLY if you pay subscription‚Äù!
My advice to everyone, forget about this app and download ANY other translation app from the App Store. This one is useless.

I don‚Äôt know what happened with this app!! It was working perfectly for years but in last 5-6 months it become useless!
From time to time, more then not, it translate some simple words in totally crazy translation which doesn‚Äôt have any connection with a source word. 
I suppose developers by this way are trying to push for subscription. The same way as they make the ‚ÄúX‚Äù (close) button rather invisible for ‚Äútry pro...‚Äù advert and is very difficult to find it.
I already install other translator which is more reliable and if this one continue to translate so bad will delete it as my wife already remove it from her phone."	negative

You simply DL it and in your settings in your keyboards you would add this application to your keyboard. It‚Äôs that simple to do and use. Only thing I‚Äôd FIX: You should be able to click on the icon which takes you from the imoji keyboard to the OG keyboard to the GIF this one BUT there seems to be an issue when trying to go back to Imoji.

There are some images which I do find unsuitable, and others that are clearly raunchy and disgusting, and I can ignore them.  However, my children are often allowed to use my phone; I am concerned that your images/gifs may be too easily accessible by children: are there filters available to set on devices to which children have access?	negative

I would like to be able to cut and paste into something other than an actual message but somewhere in that messenger app itself. So that it is easier and closer at hand.

You just known. Lol. It cracks me up. Because that‚Äôs exactly how be feeling. Into read about how they are working together with Google while improving their product they‚Äôre brand.

1356	917932200	utility	3	"(2) of my friends recommended this App.  (1) has an iPhone & the other a Samsung. They loved it.
I've been using this for about (6) weeks and have a pretty good idea of how it works now.  It's great if you want a single GIF at a time but if there are (2) or more in same section you either have to save them to your favorites right then or go back & search thru the whole list again.  

Also, maybe it's just me but when I add captions, but all the words don't always show up.  I was told it use to word wrap & you had font/font color/font placement options.  I haven't seen any of that. Those would be really nice to have.

It would be great to be able to enlarge or shrink the GIF.  Or even to create New GIF's within the app itself versus having to download a GIF Creator App in addition to this one.

Creators/Programmers of this App will hopefully begin to make some adjustments for the better of it's user experience.  Plus, please make it IOS 11 compatible or you might end up losing a lot of us because of ""bugs""!   I would definitely upgrade my Star Rating if even just a couple of changes for the better are made."	positive

Every time I try to copy a gif to my keyboard this occurs. As you could imagine, or as you may already be aware, this is pretty frustrating. Hopefully it‚Äôs just a small glitch they‚Äôll have worked out soon. Or maybe it‚Äôs because my 6S SO is unable to handle it, but I highly doubt that.

I‚Äôve wasted so much time and having this issue come up again is completely infuriating. If I could give 0 stars I would. Go to Pinterest instead, you‚Äôll find the same gifs and more.

1365	917932200	utility	5	I really enjoy using the new Tenor Keyboard due to the fact that it already has categories to chose from upon searching for a certain GIF to use. Prior to having access to this awesome updated keyboard, I would, at times, have to search for several minutes before reaching my objective in feeling good about the emotion that I am sending to the person on the receiving end of my written conversation.

It moves kind of slow but I understand that and 2.

I like that you can save the gifs in your notes or something to keep them, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having the keyboard.

1369	917932200	utility	1	I wish I could love this app. I really do. I miss out on sharing gifs and Memes with my friends. I can read through the categories. However, once I select a category voiceover does not see the gifs in that category. It skips over that section on the screen entirely. Once it is mapped for voiceover access and appropriately tagged with descriptions, I will be able to enjoy that app as everyone else does. Developers don‚Äôt realize what a large demographic they are missing out on when they don‚Äôt follow apples accessibility guidelines and instructions. When developers make their apps and content accessible per apples guidelines, they will find the apps will be easier to work with and the apps will function more reliably.

Bc I don‚Äôt remember all the gifs I saved, which is why I saved them. 

Why even have packs at all if I can‚Äôt see what I saved? Taking it further, why even have the app at all if I can‚Äôt properly save and retrieve gifs? Might as well use Google if I‚Äôm gonna have to search every single time I want a gif. Might as well delete this now obsolete app..."	positive

This application here, as absolutely everything you desire in a GIF app. When the search section gape for your eyes you‚Äôll consider sending a pulchritudinous GIF as an expression of your feelings all the time. A laughter, a cry, anger, make each text meaningful. The possibilities are endless. So do not consider not getting this app. Get the app and dive into the world of sending a moving picture.	positive

It instantly goes bck to the start. So bummed bc I used it all the time and I am abt to delete the keyboard bc it‚Äôs taking up space and I might as well find a keyboard like it that actually works...when it actually does work the gif‚Äôs are great and I can usually find one for most conversations if I want to or topics that r hilarious but some wld be even better if I cld write like I used to be able to....hopefully will be an update to fix soon....?

Which is fine for some things but for the things you need a simple thanks or please or your welcome it's hard sometimes to find one. They need to add a few more simple meanings, I mean not everything is joke worthy some things are simply basic.	positive

The app wants rights to everything you text. If you agree to the terms, you must give full access to all photos, texts, passwords, i.e. anything you text. If you don‚Äôt give full access, a pop up will repeatedly come up while you‚Äôre trying to text asking you to allow full access in your settings. 
The app is a good idea to emphasize texts, but way too much work for a simple gif and allowing full access to my phone is a bit too much to risk.

I was going to recommend this app to my children who are teenagers and opted not to. They are still very impressionable and have yet to understand the impact on how powerful visuals can be to the mind. Adult content should be reserved for adults and not younger audiences.

1385	917932200	utility	3	Compared to other apps, this one stands out on having the right gif at the right time. And the fact that you can insert your own words into it is nice. The only frustration with that is that it doesn't work 98% of the time. Everytime I try to type something up and generate it, it force closes and I have to start all over. Every now and then it works but hardly ever really. It wasn't like that when I first got it but after my first update with it it's been like that every since. If it didn't have good gifs that fit what I'm trying to say, I wouldn't have kept it.	neutral

1400	985746746	social	4	So discord has been pretty much great overall, I love using it every day and never really had any problems with how it looked or worked, until this recent update. Now, while during a call, when I lock my phone on my iPhone, discord shows up as a call for everyone to see and access, like an iPhone call. I do not feel comfortable that anyone can just see that I‚Äôm on a discord call; that‚Äôs what I liked about discord. I could only access the call via the app, that‚Äôs why I used discord. If I wanted to access the call via the lock, I would‚Äôve just called someone. Now discord is acting like an iOS phone call by making a new tab appear which is also annoying and difficult to just look at and manage with other apps that are opened. There was no original issue with how discord calls were displayed, now they‚Äôre blatantly out in the open for people to see and I believe it‚Äôs not convenient at all. It also bugs out when I just try to lock my phone sometimes. It won‚Äôt actually lock and when I tap my phone, the call will appear with the new look and my phone will be unlocked. I know you guys are trying something new but this is a bit of a stretch. Discord was discord by not looking like an iPhone/apple created application. At least make it an option to remove the display of the discord call on the lock screen, it would be greatly appreciated by those who desire some privacy.	negative
1401	985746746	social	3	"Discord is an amazing app that lets you do casual conversations without the loud notifications you would usually get from text messages. It does an amazing job at keeping notifications hidden when you want them to be.
But I cannot say the same for calls. Recently, Discord started integrating their calls with actual phone calls. This means that every time I get called on Discord, it goes through to my ringtone. The whole reason I use Discord is to keep my online life separate from my personal life. 
Although there is a setting that allows you to disable this feature, I still get the ringtone. Whenever I get called on Discord, even though the app is closed, I still get a ringtone. I even have all notifications turned off in my settings. The ringtone only lasts about 2 seconds before it realizes that it should not be there, but it gets pretty annoying, since it forces me to stop whatever i‚Äôm doing on my phone.
What annoys me the most is that this issue has been fixed before. The previous update had the setting that disabled the integrated phone calls, but it actually did its job, unlike this recent update. I had no calls going through no matter how much I was getting spammed with calls. 
I thought this problem would be gone forever, but it still managed to find its way back. I‚Äôve resorted to having to delete the app just to avoid the ringtone...again. Please fix this issue."	negative
1402	985746746	social	4	I love Discord, I have been using it for over 2 years now on both mobile and pc. Everything about Discord is great! It helps me keep in touch with friends and helps me make new ones! And the app is good quality itself! But there is only one issue I have. Every time someone calls me on Discord even if I have my notifications off, it goes through. I understand that you may want to be notified if someone calls you but the thing is it goes though as if it was a real phone call stopping me from what I was doing on my phone just to have a call notification block my screen. And the only way I have been able to fix the problem so that calls don't go through is putting my phone on Do Not Disturb but most of the time it blocks other important calls from family and people I know. If I don't answer or decline the Discord call the call goes to my call history which I don't enjoy. Even if I mute a group chat the call still goes through. What I'm saying is to make call notifications go through when we actually want them to and to make them stop invading to screen and to make them stop going through our call history. Im not sure if all of this is possible but if you could at least do one of those I would be delighted and give the app a full 5 stars, but for now its staying 4 stars. I hope you understand.	negative
1403	985746746	social	3	Sure, Discord is much better in terms of quality, but by far my biggest complaint is the removal of the private mode option while calling people. I deserve a right to privacy, as does everyone else, and it‚Äôs too loud for that to be an option. Other people can hear my conversations and it‚Äôs very bothersome. I miss having the option between the two. Don‚Äôt fix something that isn‚Äôt broken please! Otherwise, there‚Äôs this constant bug with webcams/ turning on your camera. sometimes it never loads and you have to turn it off and on to get it to work properly. I‚Äôve had to do this up to 3 times maximum to get it to work finally, which is nothing at first, but becomes annoying. Finally, (most likely not 100% discord‚Äôs fault, you can ignore this if you want) the connection seems to be getting worse. I used to love discord for the quality of the calls, but several times a week the quality becomes so bad that I have to restart the call several times to understand a sentence the recipient. The most common connection issue is definitely the that audio seems to skip out entirely for a few seconds sometimes. I understand that this could also be due to my own connection and the recipient‚Äôs connection, so take this with a grain of salt. Considering that, many times before there has been nothing wrong with our internet and this still happens.	negative
1404	985746746	social	3	"From the very beginning, I have had numerous problems with this app. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because when it does work, it is phenomenal. 
When I first got the app, it wouldn‚Äôt let me join the server I wanted to and said I was banned (even though I‚Äôd never used the app before). I re-downloaded the app recently because I was joining a clan and they required discord. I got the app and I was still logged into my old account, which was glitched, so I created a new one. I actually had to create that account on my browser because the app didn‚Äôt even let me do that. I created my account and tried to login on the app, no success. I‚Äôve re-downloaded the app numerous times since then and still, no success logging in. Luckily, my browser still works and I use that to chat with my clan. Unfortunately, even when I turn my phone sideways, I can‚Äôt see all of the writing because it shows all the members of the group on the right hand side and it takes up half of the screen. Then, I have to read downwards one letter at a time and I don‚Äôt have the patience for that, especially with all of the scrolling it requires. If I could get on the app and not have to worry about that, I would have no complaints, but this simple fix is ruining the entire app for me. If you want people to use your app, they have to be able to create an account, but so far I haven‚Äôt had any luck with that."	positive
1405	985746746	social	4	"Discord is a great tool for gaming, streaming, and almost anything you need out of a communication service/application. Yet it is lacking sometimes there is server lag or buggy happening on pc and the phone version usually just the phone version but its come along way and most of the bad issues are completely fixed. I just wish it was more compatible with certain devices, for example i don't have a great pc but it is good enough to play arma 2 - 3 with 60 frames yet discord likes to kill my cpu time usually freezes and such as well, despite playing with the prioity setting it higher or lower doesn't fix the problem. Ios version seems fine most of the time but sometimes has server lag or disconnects. But all in all its one of the best alternatives to paid communication services for gaming and streaming, and i am if it wasn't free it would be the best of paid applications, its simple you can create free servers and manage those servers with ease. btw in your update log you wrote ""with relative easy"" instead of relative ease. The best part i would say is how easy and how quickly you can create and connect with people so you can just get into your game and start playing. Thank you discord! i hope you continue to improve and fix this application, its been a few years since i have even looked at teamspeak and its all thanks to you guys|~<3"	positive
1406	985746746	social	3	"Before berating it, I‚Äôm going to give the team a thumbs up, since they created an app that essentially beats all other social media‚Äôs in its versatility and usage. It‚Äôs an easy to understand usage, for me, and simple to join servers. And the ability to create various rooms for various things also is good and creative as it allows for different topics to be shared. 

However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill. It‚Äôs difficult to get started, and when you‚Äôre using it there are always issues while doing it. When in a discord call in a Server, it works fine for a portion of the time in it. However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,
Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work. Please pay more attention to the mobile version, to make it equal to the laptop version, as it is difficult and a struggle to use. Thank you."	positive
1407	985746746	social	2	"I like Discord for what it offers, but the iOS app crashes randomly whenever I try to load a picture, gif, song, or other upload someone else posted, and crashes when I try to post pictures quite frequently. I know that a lot of people upload stuff, so the fact that it crashes as often as it does is a major concern for me. 

Another issue is that the app has decided to randomly mark all messages in random chat channels as read when I open them, even though I‚Äôve still got dozens to read before I reach the end of the string. Or I‚Äôll be reading the messages, and suddenly it marked all messages as read, to include ones that happen while I‚Äôm reading, and not even remotely caught up. It happens randomly, so I don‚Äôt even know what might be the issue. It might happen to a chat every time I open it, or just once in a while but it‚Äôs a bug I want to see gone. Being tagged in a message, and then having that indicator removed randomly is an issue. I don‚Äôt always have time to read everything in one sitting, so I want to be assured that I can read it later. It is a major issue when it starts you over at the end of the conversation, and doesn‚Äôt save from where you had to leave off. (This is mostly for my admin duties on servers.)

I like that I have the ability to take Discord with me, but if I can‚Äôt use it half the time, then it‚Äôs like I don‚Äôt even have it at all."	positive
1408	985746746	social	5	I love love love this app, it is very useful and I use it all the time but there is this special feature called ‚ÄúCustom Status‚Äù which you can only make one custom status sadly. I wish you can make way more of them or probably a limit higher than 1. But other than that it is a really good app and hope you will have a great time with this amazing app! Also another problem is that for some weird reason now it started to lock me out of the app and it doesn‚Äôt let me get on it. It keeps getting me out of the app. Also can you make it so you can change the profile of somebody in your group, kinda like the nickname, and make it so you can have banned letters/words and an only this word/letter must be used in the text channel. It would make it easier when you have multiple bots with different prefixes like the rythm bot that lets you listen to music, you can make a rythm only text channel that allows you to only say the ‚Äú!‚Äù prefix. And can you also make a customizable background, if it is too much to ask for a background then you don‚Äôt have to do that but please add the other features. Thank you so much for reading my note! Hopefully you read it all. From: The0neAndOnlyNoob#4598 :)	positive
1409	985746746	social	4	"In short, it's ugly af, and feels incredibly intrusive. The previous ui design was much nicer to look at, and much less in the way and in your face.

Please remove this asap, or change it to something more akin to the previous design. I'm seeing a lot of other people expressing dislike of it, so I hope that will help convince you to change it back.

On a side note: I'm someone who really needs empty space when using things. Not too long ago, Twitter completely updated their website, and in doing so removed a significant amount of empty space which was previously present. Until a plugin was developed to set it back to the previous design, I actually could not use the website. Something similar happened recently with Discord to a lesser extent, specifically with the friends tab. The recent addition of the ""active now"" section removed a lot of the empty space which was previously present, and as a result I can rarely use that tab without needing to look away or click something else immediately. This new update again takes away more empty space with the new ui changes, albeit to a notably lesser extent, but it's enough for it to instill at least some discomfort for me while using Discord."	negative

I love it how you can customize the roles and have other people have higher roles and being in the group of people which everyone is! I love the things that you can do when you don‚Äôt even own a server like try and earn respect and climb up the ranks! It is like a little civilization that you are in with a bunch of other people! The settings and security of Discord is great! I love the fact that you can completely secure yourself and only allow messages from people you know or having the freedom to meet people! Plus what I have researched Discord is like unhackable! You can do so many things with Discord that it‚Äôs mind blowing!

The games mode isn‚Äôt available in the app or web login unless it‚Äôs on the computer. It slightly bums me out but since discoed has always been such a great app
i overlook it. I think everyone would be happy if the game status option would be on mobile as well. Playing on the go IS a thing. Why not add it for us too? All in all that is my suggestion, the ability to change my game status on mobile just like in my computer. Yes, I understand that this may take time. But it is worth waiting for and I know you and your team can accomplish it. Thank you for reading and have a great rest of your day.

Could use a redesign.  Like why isn‚Äôt voice just enable in the same chat room so there‚Äôs no switching back and forth?

However, this review is for the mobile app.  It doesn‚Äôt work.  Every time I do so much as sneeze (another app notification/text message comes in, if I get a phone call, etc.) the app stops working.  I get that the voice should stop but after switching apps and coming back or after ending the phone call, the Discord app never recovers and must be restarted, rejoin the room, and then it works...for a while.  Until almost anything else happens.  Worst of all, when my phone falls asleep, so does Discord, sometimes.  It‚Äôs unpredictable when I‚Äôm just randomly disconnected from Discord.  My friend reported his phone calls not coming through when he‚Äôs on a Discord voice channel. Not sure which problem is worse.

I‚Äôd highly recommend using a different app. Often, my friends and I just use a phone conference call.  And I can send a text message while on a phone call. So how does this app improve my gaming other than taking bandwidth from my gaming?"	negative
1413	985746746	social	5	I started to use discord around a year ago, with that said I use it for everything, I own a few gaming teams and it is so nice to communicate with other team members, other teams, etc etc, I also use discord to communicate with friends, teammates ( especially in games where a mic is not supported ) discord does not affect my frames which is something I enjoy, I can still play my favorite games with discord open without sacrificing graphics or frame, I also have a few servers which I moderate and using bot support I can easily put up chat filters to prevent people from using certain words that may be deemed inappropriate, setting discord up was surprisingly easy and I had no trouble what so ever, I have never been let down by discord either, there servers have never been down allowing me to always communicate the quality is purely amazing, for any game devs out there I would use this as this app allowed my favorite developers to host polls, show updates, and even do giveaways, simply put this is the best way of communication for any devs, gamers, or fans, and even friends and would highly suggest that you get this app	positive

I get mobile is behind and you can‚Äôt really get all the features, and of course it‚Äôll be different, but I absolutely HATE that calls act as phone calls now. The sole reason I switched from typically using FaceTime Audio calls to Discord calls was to be able to lock my phone while talking, have my phone on my bed without the screen turning off when something covered the sensor, other people not being able to see what or who I was talking to, and it not stuffing up my call logs. Discord used to be wonderful. The thing that bothers me the most is not being able to lock my phone without the call ending. An absolute pet peeve of mine and it‚Äôs awful. Please please take it away, we were FINE without it. Stop trying to be FaceTime.

EDIT: You‚Äôve now gained back my affection, discord. You rolled back those changes and now the app is wonderful and back to how it used to be! 5 stars for this amazing app and customer service that actually reads reviews and takes action!!! Very Impressed!"	positive
1415	985746746	social	4	"I‚Äôve been using Discord for about a year and half now, the app for maybe a year. They‚Äôre been a lot of improvements since then that I was happy to see. The CallKit was definitely not one of them. I wish there was an option to at least disable it. I don‚Äôt like my Discord calls showing up in my history. I don‚Äôt like Discord calls ringing on my phone like a normal call. 
Also, I‚Äôve had a lot of audio problems since it was added. My alarm goes off? Can‚Äôt hear or talk anymore, have to leave and rejoin the call. Someone calls my phone? I can‚Äôt just mute my mic and answer anymore. I have to hang up. And even if I decline the call? Audio problems. Can‚Äôt hear. I also hardly ever get proper notifications anymore. People send me messages, but I don‚Äôt realize I get them because the sound doesn‚Äôt go off while I‚Äôm in a call. A few times I just never got a notification at all. And I‚Äôve missed a lot of calls because Discord never rang. 
I actually like the new update that lets you choose whether or not to use speaker. I was sad to see the option go, so I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs back. Wish speaker was default though. Still, it‚Äôs nice to have the option."	positive
1416	985746746	social	5	Perfect on PC, well... the camera mode on PC nearly broke my PC and broke my discord, so I had to delete it. So I used the online version and it does work and so when it was broke on my PC I was trying to fix it but I gave up after a while, so I downloaded it on mobile to be able to talk to my friend because he can‚Äôt call or text. So I go on the mobile version of discord and I like to talk to him and the sound is broke. I can hardly hear him, so I turn up the volume, doesn‚Äôt work, turn up the discord volume, doesn‚Äôt work, and finally I turn up his volume so I can hear him better, (and you wouldn‚Äôt guess this) IT DOES NOT WORK. Only then do I find the online, but I do want to play with him when I‚Äôm not at my house and I hope it works this time. The only reason I gave it 5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚Äôs because it helps me reach my friends that I can‚Äôt call or text and it works well when I don‚Äôt use the camera, and I could get in contact with online friends that I don‚Äôt know irl without giving to much information but I get to talk with them. I hope to get a developer response explaining why I had problems.	positive
1417	985746746	social	2	"Out of all of the social media platforms I‚Äôve tried, discord I would say is the most toxic of them. 
And it‚Äôs not because the employees and staff working at discord are mean, or anything, it‚Äôs because of the nature of the setup discord chooses to use. Essentially when you join a server, the guidelines you have are the ones the owner sets for you. Larger servers are often governed by mods. But the problem is that these mods generally don‚Äôt have too many qualifications to be a moderator. And when the mods are ineffective at creating a safe environment, that‚Äôs when toxic behavior thrives. Discord does have some policies, on its ToS but these are generally very simple rules, and are few and far between. I‚Äôve had many terrible experiences on servers where toxic behavior is present and the mods either do nothing about it or they take the wrong course of action. Now this isn‚Äôt something discord has much control over, but rather design of the website in it‚Äôs entirety is flawed. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app to people who who are not in a healthy state of mind, or to anyone in general. However I guess discord works for some people and if you find that this style of social media works for you then by all means download it. But do be prepared for possible toxic behavior thrown your way."	negative
1418	985746746	social	5	I absolutely love this app. Finding a gaming partner is way easier using this! I‚Äôve actually found a group of people that I frequently game with and talk to that I honestly really love. My experience this past year has been really amazing, and without trouble. However, only one thing really annoyed me in my time using discord. When you want to leave a server you‚Äôve created, you have the option to pass ownership to someone you trust or someone that‚Äôs qualified. It isn‚Äôt the same for group chats, though. If I had created a group chat, and had to leave, I would also want to pass the ability of owner to someone trusted, but it randomly picks a member to make the new owner. As the owner, I think I should be the one making that choice. Because even though I absolutely love my discord friends, some of them tend to abuse the power of owner chaotically, and I don‚Äôt want to be added back into that kind of environment. Leaving a group chat you and wanting to be added back soon just leads to you crossing your fingers and hoping someone worthy got the crown.	positive
1419	985746746	social	5	Discord is a great alternative to other apps, I got it because I was in a group and that group required you having Discord, and at first it was really complicated but then I got a hang of things. The problem started randomly, what would happen is whenever I open Discord it goes completely black, like the first time this happened I literally thought my IPad died, but nope. I closed the application, and on the screen, it showed ‚Äúdiscord‚Äù but the app screen was almost empty discord was going very faint, and I can‚Äôt do anything on discord, I deleted it and reinstalled it multiple times. Still, nothing changed, idk what to do now, because when my clan is hosting a training or a patrol to get promoted, we NEED to be in Voice Chat. This has been limiting my ability to be a active member in my clan, the only way I can use Voice Chat or chat or other servers is by using my phone. But using a iPad to play games, and a phone to communicate is really hard. Other than this I have had no problems whatsoever. This would have been a five star but this issue has made things VERY difficult. Please Help.	positive
1420	985746746	social	4	All in all, it's a great app.  In fact, I'd say it's nearly perfect on PC.  However, there are some features on PC that you can just not access on mobile.  For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.  Another thing is that you can't change somebody's role on mobile, which is very aggravating. I'm a moderator on a server and we have a specific role to give to misbehaving people which prevents them from sending messages.  But, I can only do my job as moderator if I'm on my PC, because mobile won't let me change roles.  In addition, for whatever reason, certain pictures refuse to upload, and it‚Äôs not the channel settings because it‚Äôs only with certain pictures (only on mobile).  The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.  I know that's probably gonna be controversial, but I personally know that some of my friends are big YouTubers, so they get caught up, and forget.  However, if I was able to tell if they'd read my message, I'd be able to yell at ‚Äî er, uh, talk to them about it.	positive

It logged me out, but I already saved my acc password and user, so I tried using that. It failed saying that the email was not registered so I thought ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs no big deal I can just try registering again with the same email cause it says the email is apparently ‚Äònot registered‚Äô yet‚Äù so I did that and THEN sit said that the email was ‚Äòalready registered‚Äô. Okay WHAT?! So I tried creating an acc again, it failed. I tried signing back IN again, still a fail. And I know it‚Äôs not my technology glitching our non kyle and that it‚Äôs apps fault bc no matter how many devices I tried to switch to, it still wouldn‚Äôt work. I used to like this app a bit before this stuff started happened cause this app is really good for like if your friend dosent have a phone and can only text on pc or something like that and it‚Äôs also good for gaming and streaming I guess but if you keep getting logged out, there‚Äôs no point of giving the app a good review, especially if your like me and have been downloading and deleting the app several times with no success and have literally been trying this for over 4 DAYS STRAIGHT!!!! The developer(s) should really fix this problem before it gets a lot more bad reviews due to this glitch.	positive
1422	985746746	social	5	"What can I say about Discord? I started using it a year or so ago off of a friends recommendation, and I have no interest in going back to any of the multiple VOIP programs I‚Äôve used in the past (Xfire, Skype, C3, Steam, Mumble, Teamspeak, Razer Comms); Discord beats out all of those for one major reason: Absolute control over everything. The ability to create and manage my own channel with access to just about every detail keeps me coming back, and makes things so much easier on me. Volume sliders on everybody giving me peace of mind on how loud (or quiet) people are being, being able to voice/text mute people that are being abusive in chat, and having multiple text/voice channels is just icing on the cake.

I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt write a review for Discord till they rolled out with the video call/screenshare update on PC, and they did so here I am. 

If you‚Äôre wanting a reliable, free, all-access VOIP program for your gaming or chatting needs, Discord is for you. With their optional Discord Nitro subscription offer I hope they never run out of money to support this gem."	positive
1423	985746746	social	5	Heya! I just wanna say I love using Discord especially on mobile devices when I don‚Äôt have a laptop, and it‚Äôs quite a fun app to chat with others.  However, there are some things that I want to have Discord improve on or at least try to help with the app to make it better, especially for mobile devices.  One thing in particular is to have more color choices for roles and to customize role colors on mobile devices.  Another thing is when I see some people‚Äôs status when it says something like ‚ÄúPlaying Sleeping‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlaying And 3...2...1..‚Äù, etc, I want that option to be available to mobile devices, or if that is already available, please respond to me with how I would do that.  One last thing is when I try to save a picture with a transparent background, when I go look at it in my photos, it doesn‚Äôt go from a white background to taping to a black background. I really would like these issues to be fixed in the next update or two.  Other than that, this app is very great and I love how it is improving but by bit! Keep up the great work!	positive
1424	985746746	social	2	"I've been using discord since early 2016 & absolutely loved it, but the decisions made during 2019 have left me very unimpressed with the staff's lack professionalism when handling serious issues. I was completely unable to use the app or the desktop version due to the April fool's ""joke"" they decided to pull that completely removed their entire platform's functionality from disabled users, including myself. I sent emails to support only to be greeted with replies of the support staff flat out lying to me about the ""prank"" being a permanent redesign for the platform after I told them that I could no longer use it due to a disability. Luckily it was reverted back, but rather than actually addressing the seriousness of the situation, the team behind Discord's social media played along with people complaining about bringing light mode back. The newest update the Apple version received is just not exactly very functional for most users, options that were once quick to access have been moved to a separate menu & you need to go through that menu to even change your profile's online status. It's just extremely unpractical for most users & the way it's designed & functions just doesn't make much sense."	positive
1425	985746746	social	5	I am personally a fan of Discord and the idea behind it. It is common where friends are playing A video game or something, and don‚Äôt have a way to communicate except the X-Box chat or something. Also, Discord is very helpful for those who don‚Äôt have a phone number, or only have a tablet or computer. It allows you to speak to your friends, and you are the person who controls who you text, unless a friend invites you to a server. But all you have to do to void that is simply ignore it. It allows kids who don‚Äôt have the option to just simply FaceTime or text a friend to do so, and that‚Äôs a big thing that I love about this. Not only does it have to be about gaming, you can use it as a way to study. Discord allows you to use a normal key board, allowing you to use fonts, Bitmoji, and normal emojis, so you can send text messages like you regularly would. One of the best parts about it is that you can delete and re download it, and etc, but it will always save any chats you may have had. Discord is one of my favorite apps, honestly.	positive
1426	985746746	social	2	Sometimes I love Discord. The audio quality is much better than normal phone calls and it‚Äôs a great way to text my friends aside from Snapchat and iMessage. But a lot of the time it either doesn‚Äôt work and I can‚Äôt hear who I‚Äôm on the phone with, or today for example it won‚Äôt connect at all. It‚Äôs actually making me very anxious because there may be something important on Discord. In my opinion this is a very poorly made app, I think that if you‚Äôre going to take the time and pay the money to create an app as popular as Discord then you should at least make it effective. I looked online and apparently sometimes Discord can be ‚Äúdown‚Äù (Which is bizarre. I‚Äôve had it with Snapchat too.) which is very disappointing to me. In my opinion these apps should never go ‚Äúdown‚Äù. iMessage is never down, so why are these? It boggles my mind sometimes how poorly made this app is. And no I won‚Äôt delete it because I use it often. But I am very strongly requesting a major improvement, because this isn‚Äôt working. This is bad. Somebody really needs to get to fixing it. If your apps are ‚Äúdown‚Äù that is a major issue, because you‚Äôre the ones making the app not us and our use of the app is on our time and not yours. Thank you.	negative
1427	985746746	social	5	"I love Discord. It‚Äôs really addicting, especially with the bots. I can easily talk to my friends on it, voice chat, and even find new people that share the same interests as me. While some people complain at the fact that some bots cost money to gain full access to, I don‚Äôt mind. I mean, they have to find some way to fund it and make money, right? Discord didn‚Äôt even make the bots. Discord Nitro is the only way Discord has to support itself, so people should really be more grateful that they aren‚Äôt required to use it and that they don‚Äôt have to spend every minute closing an ad. Discord is one of the only add free apps that I can use, so I appreciate that also.

The only problem I have with the app is when I‚Äôm in it, it will sometimes exit me out randomly. While this isn‚Äôt a problem since I can just go back into it, it gets annoying at times. I would love if you could fix that. :)

Overall, this is a great app. I don‚Äôt see anything Discord could improve on besides the bugs, so I rate it a 5/5 easy to use app."	positive
1428	985746746	social	3	"This latest update has caused the app to awkwardly lag at points. Especially when it comes to trying to use discord emojis. I find myself accidentally sending my message before it even registers that I‚Äôve clicked on what emoji I want. I‚Äôve never had this happen before, and though it doesn‚Äôt seem like much of an issue, it also goes for typing as well. It‚Äôs like I completely miss letters, and it just doesn‚Äôt register that I‚Äôm tapping on them. This doesn‚Äôt happen anywhere else, and I haven‚Äôt had any problems with my phone otherwise.
Also I‚Äôd really prefer it if autocorrect went back to the way it was, where you could send things and not have it change after pressing send. The last word becomes drastically changed way too often, and it‚Äôs especially annoying when I‚Äôm trying to catch a pokemon and it no longer sends what I type and instead what autocorrect thinks I‚Äôm trying to say. Maybe this doesn‚Äôt pose as a huge deal to others, but I really do hope you‚Äôll reconsider forcing autocorrect when pressing send. I‚Äôve become so used to it not doing it that it now bugs the heckers out of me.
Other than that, I love discord üëçüèª"	positive
1429	985746746	social	2	"Okay. Let me just state that I love discord upfront. I‚Äôve used the app daily for over 2 years now and overall it‚Äôs so much better than things like Skype and I‚Äôve met many new friends. However, the most recent update released today (May 11,2019) there are some things I just really dislike a lot. 
First off, they moved the search button feature and I used that a lot so now I accidentally start calls and would really prefer (at the very least) the option to move it back. 
Second, calls now come up as an actual phone call and show in recent phone logs. It also opens a new tab that is uncloseable and seems to be always on ‚Äúconnecting...‚Äù even though I can hear my friend and my friend can hear me clearly. I can‚Äôt close this secondary ‚Äúphone‚Äù tab without ending the call and it‚Äôs really frustrating and I‚Äôm really hoping you guys will revert the call settings to how it used to be. 
On another note, just a mild annoyance, when calls now start, it automatically plays audio on speaker and I wish there was a way to switch it to the private call setting. 
Hope these issues get fixed, otherwise I‚Äôll have to take a break from using such a great app."	positive
1430	985746746	social	4	"I‚Äôve been using discord for several years, but every update seems to make the app worse. I see very few people in the reviews actually liking the IOS integrated calling. Please, for the sake of your dedicated user base, reverse it or make it optional. I cannot stand the fact that I cannot lock my phone during a call. Not to mention the constant cutting out during voice calls and connection issues. (Which have just gotten worse, may I add) It‚Äôs so bad that me and my boyfriend have considered switching apps. This is ridiculous. If I wanted to have a phone call where I couldn‚Äôt lock my phone and the screen goes black when my hand covers the top of my phone, I would have just used the regular iPhone calling system. Fix. This. Or risk losing business. This is turning into Skype and I left that platform for very similar reasons. Love this app but hate what you are doing to it. Really have hope that you will fix these issues and understand that people don‚Äôt like the integrated calling system.

UPDATE: Thank you, discord, for fixing your app. Appreciate it!"	positive
1431	985746746	social	4	Discord is an amazing app, and I love it. But the mobile version is missing quite a few important features. For example, Discord on mobile (possibly IOS only) doesn't have Audit Logs for server moderation. Audit Logs are very important for server moderation, so that is one flaw with the mobile app. Also, only a minor setback this is, is the fact that there is no emote button on the mobile app. Yes, you can easily tap the emoji button on your keyboard, but if you are in a server with global emotes, you have to type out the names of the emote. But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app! These setbacks can be overlooked, so Discord is STILL my main way of contacting friends.	positive
1432	985746746	social	3	"Discord is generally a good app that I use frequently to chat with friends. However, recently with the new updates, I‚Äôve noticed quality in calls drop. Granted, the calls were never super great for me, but unlike before, it would consistently mute my friends so that I would have to leave and rejoin, then it‚Äôd work. Not only that, but my friends would often cut out several times during call. It could be a network issue and I‚Äôm sure this isn‚Äôt 100% discord‚Äôs fault, however it‚Äôs been frequent and annoying at times. Another issue I‚Äôve been experiencing is really annoying. For some reason, discord has completely stopped working at random intervals. What I mean is that even though I get notifications, when I try to launch the app, the loading glitches and I‚Äôm forced out. The only way to fix this to my knowledge is deleting the app and downloading it again. It is happening more and more frequently and is an issue I‚Äôve experienced ever since the latest update
Other than that, discord is great. It‚Äôs an easy app to use to chat with friends and I would give it a higher rating if not for the issues I stated."	negative
1433	985746746	social	4	"I have been a user of Discord for over a year and a half, with my experience being extremely positive. However, recently the user interface has been changed and I‚Äôve received many complaints about it being too childish and distracting. On several occasions I have been accidentally voice called because of the UI update. I‚Äôve also had a myriad of people say that is too cluttered and they preferred the older layout. My moderators struggle with all the extra bells and whistles strapped to the mobile version of this application. I am here today with a proposal for two different modes; one is for people who want to play with the revisions and the other is for those who don‚Äôt want to be constantly assaulted with a waterfall of bloat they don‚Äôt use. I know that I‚Äôm a single voice but I‚Äôm here to speak for everyone who‚Äôs told me their issues with the new UI.

Hello Discord Developers & Future Discord Customers. I would say I highly Recommend Discord for Gamers, Streamers, and more. You can create a Group with different Channels while Group Owners Get To Download and Program Bots That can Moderate the Chat/Voice Channels.

For Discord Developers
Amazing Job with all the Features and of course creating the app. I would want it to switch everything to subscriptions so then it‚Äôs free but you can upgrade to a Premium Member for $5.99 Per 3 Months and they get access to Emojis Created by Discord, Access To Sharing Nature Sounds (Frogs, Birds, Etc...), and they can create Premium Channels which allows channel members to Like, Favorite, and/or Dislike a Message and a Special Bot That the Channel Owner can add. I also want a Membership Called ‚ÄòStar Streamer‚Äô which allows the Streamer to Sell Merch and Donations, Use Special Animations on a Avatar (e.g. Dance, Floss, Dab, Etc...), and to add share Videos where they can Name, Describe, and Monetize with a Tip Jar+LeaderBoard where Channel Members can Donate. So kind of a Twitch/Youtube thing."	positive
1435	985746746	social	3	"I love discord and it‚Äôs a great hub for socializing and finding new friends, especially people to play games with. BUT this recent update where private calls showing up on the lock screen while okay, also shows up in my phones recent call log which is not okay. I‚Äôm a private person with an extremely busybody mom that I still love with and who still enjoys spying on things that she has no business sticking her nose in at my age. Discord‚Äôs private calls was a nice way to speak to my friends without getting the third degree but now I have to go into my call logs and make sure all discord calls are deleted now which is not something I had to previous do. 

On top of that, discord calls seem to be getting poor in connection to the point I‚Äôve been considering finding a new app to use for voice calls, especially when competitive gaming of which I do frequently in Dead By Daylight. 

Discord, please stop making yourselves look pretty and fix these issues that never used to be issues. I want private calls 100% to stay in discord app, if I wanted to make a phone call I wouldn‚Äôt be using you."	positive
1436	985746746	social	2	"Old Discord was so much better honestly. Less lag and more privacy when in a call and your phone was locked and didn't show you in a call. Discord bugs out calls so often when you try and join back in a call with someone and still says connecting until both of you guys restart the call. I understand new layout and everything is great, but if you actually fix any bugs and issues, that be great too, and please bring back old Discord from few months prior where we actually HAD our privacy in a call not being shown on our lock screen. It makes it hard because power button can also make you leave the call which is even more annoying and because you can leave the call accidentally by pressing or tapping on your earbuds which is mildly irritating.

Apparently you fixed that issue lock screen issue apparently few days or a week ago now. Thank you, but others issues would be nice please because I really do enjoy your app, but it irritates me when I often complain how there's still bugs when it comes to calls and text not working while in a call sometimes until you reset Discord"	neutral
1437	985746746	social	5	"On discord, a lot of potential stress about interacting with people is taken away since it‚Äôs mostly through text. (But there is also a verbal chat option if you prefer talking) If spending time with people in person wears you out or is stressful to you, discord is a great way to make friends at your own pace.

Edit: Since the new update, there have been in app notifications that block other things and can‚Äôt be turned off. In order to stop them, you have to mute everything which would also get rid of notifications out of the app which I do not want to turn off. These really takes away from the experience. I‚Äôve seen developer responses on other reviews saying they are working on a way to disable the in app notifications and this will be in the next update. I really hope that update comes soon. Until then, I‚Äôm lowering my rating of a 5 out of 5 stars to a 4 out of 5 stars.

1438	985746746	social	3	Hey, so. I started to use this app so i could communicate with others, especially yters who have discord servers. As a mistake, I misspelled my email by one letter, so i went to change it because I needed to verify it to be able to message in some servers ,and since the email is incorrect, it wouldn‚Äôt send the message to my gmail/mail for verification. As I went to correct my email and hit save, it would give me a message. The message simply said something along the lines of, ‚Äúemail has already been registered.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure what it meant by this, because i never verified my actual email just yet. Thus, once i hit save it wouldn‚Äôt change it. I‚Äôm currently stuck with an incorrect email that can‚Äôt be verified nor changed to the right one, because it‚Äôs misspelled so it wont send. Is there anything I can do to be able to change my email?? Oh, And i‚Äôm on mobile too... if that has something to do with it. What exactly does the message ‚ÄúEmail already been registered‚Äù mean. My email hasn‚Äôt been able to be added yet!! And I haven‚Äôt given anyone access to it either.	negative

I use Discord daily because it where my friends and fans (I‚Äôm a youtuber) chat with me, the idea of letting you make roles and emojis is brilliant and a original idea. You can also use it just like messaging but without giving your phone # away. Although it does need fixes.
I use IOS and one problem that I have just recently encountered is that my discord broke, I would log onto the app and it would freeze and bring me back to the home page. I deleted the app then downloaded it again hoping it would work, unfortunately it didn‚Äôt. The next day I go on my settings to see if there were any bugs and apparently discord isn‚Äôt a app on my phone anymore, what? I am confused. Besides that it does glitch out every now and then showing old messages and then after you send a message it loads the new ones first. 
Besides that discord is a great app and fun for ‚Äúall ages‚Äù I would encourage you to download it."	positive
1440	985746746	social	4	I think this to be a pretty cool application considering it‚Äôs a free to use messaging and calling service, which also lets you create your own servers for your own gaming communities/other things that may need discussion. One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you‚Äôre using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can‚Äôt do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I‚Äôm listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.	positive

I use it to video chat my family, text my friends from school, call people from around the WORLD to play games. Discord just makes me want to play games even more. The interaction I can get in one single app is amazing and all the emotes having ways to express yourself! The discord nitro with amazing moving emotes even better! And it‚Äôs amazingly cheap. Discord‚Äôs logo makes it look fun and wumpus plush is just so cute I love wumpus ^.^ also you can make YOUR OWN EMOTE!!!! You can have channels dedicated to other games for people around the world to interact in. It‚Äôs simple and easy to use. Whats even better is pining your favorite pictures or links! It‚Äôs helpful to find once so far up the chat. I appreciate discord so much for giving me such an amazing app to interact in. No other app can compete best of all its all FREE! ( except nitro ) but it‚Äôs cheap as fuuuudge. Everything else is free lol	positive

EDIT: I've changed my rating because I've been running into a problem again that I assumed was handled in the later updates from the early versions of discord. The app will attempt to upload images and then completely crash and close out, even with images that I've sent through it before. The only thing that will fix this issue is deleting and re-installing the app, which can be a timesuck, but this issue always comes back. I've deleted the app 3 separate times prior to this trying to fix the issue and it's a temporary fix. I use an iPhone 6, so it's possible it's some user-end issues, but please look into this and see if there's something you can do or if I can see what's messing with it on my end. The app is otherwise excellent, this is the main bug I've been having."	positive
1443	985746746	social	5	So, the app overall is really good! And I definitely recommend it as long as you associate with the right people. Most people on discord are rude, mean and just terrible. But there‚Äôs a mix of just about everyone on discord and that comes in handy when you‚Äôre looking for friends. But, the notifications don‚Äôt work for me. And it‚Äôs not just me! It‚Äôs also my friends on there too, either it be direct messages or even server messages. I‚Äôve went to settings and enabled the notifications many times but no matter what I do they just don‚Äôt work. So in the next update I‚Äôm hoping to see an improvement on that if it‚Äôs possible for, also I‚Äôd also like a way to delete the chat and have it deleted for good! Usually when you close a dm the messages stay there, but I‚Äôm also hoping for a way to delete it for good. I bet many people are looking for the same things in discord as I am, so please reply to let me know what could and can‚Äôt be done?	positive

They are neglecting basic application decency that their competitors have already stepped up with. Discord has been saying for many years that they care about screen reader accessibility, for example, but they have done next to nothing to make sure that blind people using these softwares are able to effectively join their conmunities like anyone else would. I'm sure it's a great program, so I hear from my friends using it, but until they catch up with the times and make it so I can navigate with VoiceOver at least, only two stars here.

Regarding your response:
I don't think your team understands that you're asking us to submit feedback for an unusable system on that very system. Many people can't access that server, and the few blind folks who told me they could said it was by luck or coincidence.
You're telling us we can have a key to the house, but it's currently locked inside."	positive
1445	985746746	social	3	"The discord app had worked almost seamlessly in the past in the two years that I had used it, but with the new updates (the ones that coincided with the ""new fresh look"" of the message bar), the keyboard has been having very suboptimal performance, to the point where it interferes with my ability to use it so much that I decided to write a review to make this problem known. I've never had issues such as this one in other iOS apps. 

What happens is that I will sometimes type a message and it will jump to the middle of an already typed word and type in the middle of that. At other times, autocorrect will refuse to work, and when I type on messages to edit them, they will be fixed in the message bar but will send with the original typo. Sometimes, I have sent a message, and while it does send, the whole message will still remain in the message bar where I had typed it, making me clear it manually. 

Overall, my discord experience has been good across all platforms, but I do hope a fix for this is issued soon."	positive

I was hoping this call display update would be improved somehow. The call acts like a real call on iOS and it‚Äôs really annoying. The status bar at the top of the home screen, the full screen display when the phone is locked, etc. When my phone is locked, I have to press the home button 3 times rather than once with finger print. First time wakes up the phone, second clears the call screen to my lock screen, third to get to the home screen. Second of all, every. single. call. shows up on the recent calls list. If you disconnect the call and start it again it shows up as a new call in the list. My recent calls is more discord than actual calls. 

This feature would cause me to uninstall any other app. An app needs to stay inside the app, not take over the rest of my phone. If other people like this feature, maybe make it an optional setting."	positive

My biggest complaint is that the phone calls now save to an actual phone log when you call someone....really? You had to add that. Just why? Now I‚Äôm uncomfortable using the app because I don‚Äôt know if the app is going to get inside my phone and monitor my information and monitor all of my contacts outside of discord so I had to uninstall and write this review :/
I also don‚Äôt feel comfortable if it gets saved to a phone log that the phone company can now see  who I‚Äôm calling on discord.(cause monitoring everyone these days is out of control). So I don‚Äôt feel comfortable using the call feature on discord because now my phone company has to see me calling a friend on discord.

In my last review, I complained about the rediculously slow loading times. That has seemed to have been almost completely eliminated, which is probably the most positive change. And that‚Äôs really about all the good changes that have happened. Some minor complaints I have on the mobile port is the fact the app seems to not be as up-to-date to the PC version of the application. Most of the other complaints in my past review still remain unchanged. For example: All users are able to post whatever they want without the worry of a filter (unless a bot is set up in the server.) I‚Äôm still shocked by the fact that NSFW channels are able to be created on Discord when the app is rated 12+.

Most of the updates were mostly major bug-fixes. But at least the program is much more usable. All what I could really do is give the app another star for is efforts on keeping the app bug-free as possible."	neutral
1449	985746746	social	4	Hi! I know you won‚Äôt have much time to read this but I will really appreciate it if you do. First of all, this is a great app! There are so many things that I like. For example, you can make your own name and it will always be free to use! This is also a way to talk to all of your friends, make new friends and talk about your favorite things (gaming)! But to make this an even better app, I would personally recommend a few new features that I think everyone will enjoy! I think that there should be a feature that says when the person that you were talking to was last online. This can be used as a safety feature as well as a feature to see what‚Äôs going on because it can say if someone went missing when they were last seen or talked to. I would also recommend that you can tell when someone has read the message. And it‚Äôs for the same reasons as the other new feature. This is what I hope you can add to discord to make it a better app!	positive

Such as the wifi restarting itself and the settings not applying. Now my biggest complaint is within the app you can see how much ""usage"" everyone has been doing on the internet. Now when I say usage I mean, how much time everyones spent using the internet. I'd much rather be able to see just how much data everyone has been using or how much each device is using in data because of Comcasts new 1000 gigabyte internet plans. Going over the 1000 gigs you have to pay an extra $10 for another 50 gigabytes. So instead of knowing how much everyone's using the internet, you get to see the amount of ""usage"" or who's been using the internet more which doesn't help because someone could just be we surfing but be on the longest and show up as the one who's using the internet the most. So please, PLEASE, add a feature that allows you to see just how much each person or each device on your network is using so you can keep track of who's using to much data and so you don't go over your restricting 1000gb bandwidth limit and charge your loyal customers more.

Which would be very, very useful if I could. Like for example with the pre-adjusted time I have the Wi-Fi paused at 9:30pmand I can only have turned back on all the way up to 8:30am.  I would like to be able to set my own sleep and wake time. Like for instance I have my children‚Äôs Wi-Fi paused at 9:30 PM and I would like to have it un-paused at 5:00pm the next day.  Because my room is on the other side of the house so I have the Wi-Fi paused at 9:30pm to make sure my children are not getting on their games, phones etc. after I go to bed. In the mornings my children get up and go to school. Well sometimes I‚Äôm not always home when they get home from school. They know they are to do their homework before playing on the games, phones etc. but as anyone should know any teenager is not going to follow through on what they are supposed to do especially when a parent is not home to make sure they do as their told. That‚Äôs why I would like to be able to set the sleep and wake time as to what fits my lifestyle.	positive

Well I got it and installed it per the instructions on the app- easy btw- it seemed to work. At first it looked like it was working, but the phone wouldn‚Äôt connect, and the internet light wasn‚Äôt on. Later on in the day we couldn‚Äôt connect our devices to the network, so I restarted it, and then reinstalled it. I reinstalled it again in the evening. The app told me it couldn‚Äôt connect to restart, so I just reinstalled it as a new device. The next day - no problem. Then around 5:30 the kids told me the internet wasn‚Äôt working. Sure enough the app wouldn‚Äôt connect. When I finally got to log in, I reinstalled again. So far, so good. I am hesitant to return the old box. Trouble shooting did not work during this process.

Their instructions to shut off the router didn‚Äôt work, even if shut down overnight.   So I pretty much had to go with Comcast‚Äôs gateway if I wanted consistent access to the internet.  So now I‚Äôm trapped with a gateway that allows me access to the internet, but is not customizable at all.  I can‚Äôt shut down access to everyone, unless all devices are assigned to the same profile.  Not very helpful with young kids that need parental controls to filter content.  Parental controls are advertised, but they‚Äôre really Comcast Controls, and parents have no input on what content is filtered.   And the Comcast Control does let pornography through. Not my idea of good parenting.  Overall not happy with my extremely limited choices here.  Choose my own gateway that Comcast seems to do whatever they can to prevent it from working, but is customizable and controllable, for those intermittent periods of time that I get internet access. Or, get internet access with with no control over content.  Really thinking I might cancel it all-together.	negative

Also being able to see how much someone is on a device is a great feature.  The problem is more with the internet itself.  It drops for no apparent reason for a few minutes here and there and this seems to happen daily.  Comcast says it‚Äôs when the system runs an update but it‚Äôs at different times of the day sometimes multiple times a day.  We‚Äôve purchased their pods to try to extend the WiFi throughout the house as they recommended.  We even exchanged our router twice at their suggestion but nothing seems to help.  The WiFi speed is phenomenal; we are able to have 6 devices connected at the same time with no problems other than when the WiFi decides to drop.  It‚Äôs usually back up in 10 or 15 minutes but the drops are really frustrating when trying to be on a webinar for work and all of a sudden your internet drops!!	positive

I normally setup my routers in this manner as a sort of extra security measure ‚Äî never know when a friend may bring a virus-infected laptop over!

I think the guest network option is missing because it is reserved for the public ‚Äòxfinitywifi‚Äô network...? If so, then it would be really cool if the devices connecting to my home network, but which are assigned to the Guest profile, could be logically treated as being on a separate network so home and guest devices couldn‚Äôt communicate with each other. Or, if a dedicated guest network could be made available again and have any devices connecting to it automatically placed in the Guest profile.

Comcast has started charging us when we go over a monthly limit, and I'm bumping up to that limit every month.  It's great that they have the ability to show % bandwidth utilization by device or by profile BUT this is where usefulness is severely lacking.  In short, we need a way to debug bandwidth hogs
% bandwidth is useless by itself, we need to know actual bandwidth used, and not ""low"" or ""very high""
need to be able to see top devices across the entire network, not just top profiles
need to be able to drill down from each profile to see top devices
Why can't the device name default to the host name, i spent WAY too much time going to each device with its useless default device name, (see UI complaints below).  A simple fix would have been to just use the hostname as opposed to some combo of manufacturer (where known) and MAC address
UI navigation is just awful, I spend way too much time scrolling down to where I was before when I select an object and then click the back arrow ... figure out a way to remember where I was in a scrolling list before I made a selection (probably the #1 issue that made changing device names so time consuming).

There are many more usability comments that I can make, but the next on the list would be to create an iPAD version of the app, or one that can use the iPAD additional real estate."	positive

2) Allow Me to Set a Timer when I UNPAUSE a device: when I pause a device, I get an option to set a timer after which the device is auto unpaused. But when I unpause a device I don't get the same timer option so the device will be paused automatically after a certain period. This is particularly frustrating because if we have to set timers to remind us to manually pause our kids devices e.g. after a hour. And if we forget, the kids have internet access for the rest of the day.

That‚Äôs why I like using the XFI app. You can see all wireless devices on your network including offline devices and you can edit the WiFi settings including channel and width without having to connect through the web on a computer. You can even reset the router even while on cellular data. I can also check the peak data usage at specific times, change the logical names of those same devices, but one addition that I‚Äôd like to see added would be the ability to view what device was utilizing so much data at that time. Seems like my peak usage was at 3 AM over the last 24 hours. I was in bed, asleep by 10:30, and I don‚Äôt have kids. Perhaps I was sleep gaming? Anyways that would be my only complaint.	positive

I wish there was a better way to view each devices usage, numerically would be more helpful. Zero to very high doesn‚Äôt tell us much. We don‚Äôt have TV so we stream everything, something that gave a better breakdown would help us understand more why there may be a jump when streaming through the same app for a couple hours. 
I also wish there was a way to see the amount of data used for the month so far in this app. Currently I go back and forth between this one and the Xfinity app to view that. A little frustrating when this app is literally controlling our devices using WiFi, we should be able to see all data information here as well."	positive

Although I do find myself needing a few other options to keep a exploring child at bay and to make things a little easier with a one touch option. I would like to be able to pause the entire router and be able to make a group for all the kiddos so I can pause them all at once. 

Another thing I would like to see is a new device blocker so when you block an IP it will block the entire PC from just creating another and rejoining the network under that new IP. Makes it hard to put a curfew on something when there is just another way around it. A blocker so that no new devices can access the network without that blocker being disabled would fix that issue. I would also like to see the password tab deleted. I see no reason for that and feel my LAN would be much more secure without it."	positive

Takes several phone calls, escalations to get to an ENGINEERING team who can't figure it out, takes 6 days to call me back, I'm not home so when I call them back 3 days later they've closed my ticket and I have to start all over again!!??? No discount. No compensation for MY wasted time or inadequate product. Not worth it. Going to buy my own router with parental controls this weekend and stop paying them their monthly fees. Everyone should do the same.

I am a bit disappointed that I had to make 4 phone calls before they finally told me my gateway had hardware issues and I needed to have a service call or exchange it at the store. I chose to drive to the Xfinity store and spent 30 minutes waiting after checking in. They politely swapped out my broken gateway for a new one. I brought it home, plugged it in and within 15 minutes I had the xFi gateway and all 3 xFi pods setup. I linked my smart home gadgets quite easily: an Ecobee 3 thermostat, six IP security cameras, wireless window open/broken alarm sensors and WiFi door locks. While there are a lot of features unavailable from Xfinity residential service, and the new bandwidth caps are terrible, you get what you pay for.	negative
1474	1178765645	utility	5	Love the app and how easy it is to setup. I‚Äôm a pediatrician and a mom, so Kids safety is at my priority. There are many apps and gadgets to help with internet safety, and even for a computer savvy person like me, they are overwhelming. Having rules for screen time is important and difficult to tract, but this app let me review the use in the last week, setup rules and sleep times. I can even pause an electronic in the moment and from far away from my iPhone. Assigning the electronics to a group, person or house, helps to leave other electronics  running. Changing the password of your WiFi and finding is anyone is trying to connect with alerts, hep with security control from the outside hackers.

Recently moved to Denver where the two main options are Xfinity and Century Link. Admittedly, we tried to go with Century Link, as it was a less expensive service with similar speeds. After a week and a half, and two no shows by the install tech, we called an told them to refund our deposit and cancel our request. We walked into the Xfinity store, walked out 30 minutes later with our modem/router (complete with cables and guides), plugged in at home, and had amazing speeds within 15 minutes. Add to that the Xfi app, which has amazing features and interface. Worth the extra money ($20 per month).

1477	1178765645	utility	2	I honestly hate calling Comcast.  Often you get an overseas office using a dictation sheet to ‚Äútroubleshoot‚Äù wasting an hour or more of your time.  I loved the ability to restart my device from the app and troubleshoot on my own before wasting time calling in.  Now I can‚Äôt do that!  When I attempt to, I face a screen asking me to log in (AFTER I chose the device to troubleshoot so clearly I was logged in!!) and then I get a screen that is blank with ‚Äúchoose which tv device you want to restart‚Äù with two buttons that are grayed out - perhaps because we don‚Äôt HAVE tv devices!!  I chose my internet device to restart.  In a recent app update this was supposed to have been resolved but it isn‚Äôt.  We pay for blast speed and are not getting that!  I feel like Comcast charges a lot and makes obtaining help difficult to deter our interest in actually reaching out.  The failure of the app to do the troubleshooting should be expected I suppose.	positive
1478	1178765645	utility	5	This is a simple and effective way to disable  network access to a group or selected devices. Especially with kids and their quick overuse of device time. For us, online gaming with a PS4 was a problem when it came to getting things done like school, chores and even getting ready to go. Now it‚Äôs one click and boom! No fighting for the controller or remote. This is the solution we‚Äôve been waiting for a while that is less hassle, and safer than using remote management through port forwarding. Strongly recommend this BUT it only works with specific modems and fortunately our xFi modem was an update/upgrade at no extra cost. If you download the app, it will tell you if your modem is compatible or able to upgrade.	positive
1479	1178765645	utility	4	Great app!  Nice clean UI & easy to use.  Just a few recommendations & observations.  1) Would like the bedtime mode slider to allow me to have the wake up time to be later in the day.  For my kids on school nights I would like to start bedtime mode at 9pm & then wake up at 5pm.  That way they can get homework done for a few hours after school before being sucked into the personal device WIFI vortex.  Currently wake up time can not be later than 11:30am.  2) I am not sure if my daughter is changing the IP address of her phone or what she is doing, but she somehow finds ways to get phone access to the WIFI on her profile through some other device IDs.  I keep finding these other devices when only she is on her phone & have to add them to her profile.  Any recommendations?  Thank you!	positive
1480	1178765645	utility	4	Basically be able to tell who just came by and left without me noticing their sneaky ways but unaware of the device log to my internet. You‚Äôll find out who the one doing all of lying is real fast. I can already sort which machines have the most traffic. Also anykind of further info viewable on each device would be appreciated because with just the current info it leaves me guessing when I have too many things happening at once. Too many devices can quickly get to be too hard to identify to get a definite answer without left guessing which guest device last logged on. Or who it belongs too without being on top of labeling the stuff that guests connected with. More info to point to more clues as to what device I‚Äôm dealing with would help out a lot.	positive
1481	1178765645	utility	1	This app was nice at first but it‚Äôs garbage it belongs in a trash can. The app worked fine at first but obviously that wasn‚Äôt gonna last for long. It says I have 1 device connected when I definitely have at least 15 the profiles seemed nice at first but it doesn‚Äôt correctly say how many devices are connected. The data for who is using the WiFi is completely inaccurate. You might as well have your kid draw a random bar graph and use that for your data. I also have an xbox and ps4 which I have connected to the WiFi and assigned to a profile but every time I turn one of my consoles on it does not recognize it and I have to rename it and delete the profile I already day made for it. I would tell Comcast to just fix it and the app would be great but just go with a different internet provider cause this company does not care about their customers nor do they care about the quality of there service. Hope this company goes broke and the owners live in a garbage can.	positive

Anyway, I wish I could give it 5 stars, given how awesome and stable it is; however, I just reported a fairly substantial defect in the statistics data on paused va. active devices in the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù (profiles / groups) tab of the app. I reported this in details, with steps to reproduce, and would imagine it would be fixed ASAP.

1483	1178765645	utility	2	Can no longer unpause devices or wake devices up with a single click. The ‚Äúwake up‚Äù button, tells you it just ‚Äú woke up‚Äù the devices, but they don‚Äôt work and still show they are in sleep mode. It used to work, but since the ‚Äúupdate‚Äù it does not work unless you physically change the schedule. Then you have to remember to change the schedule back.  The app also frequently freezes - which is a problem when devices are paused, if I want to unpause a device or wake them up from bedtime, I can‚Äôt until the app decides to start working again. So no WiFi access until it decides to start working.  Extremely frustrating. Apparently need to pay more for a separate device to do what xFi monitoring used to.

The most hated company in the US (Fact), terrible customer service, overpriced, understaffed, under qualified, scum of a company. In our latest home, they decided to set up the router in the ourside wall of the house in the barber the basement. Brilliant. The technician fell asleep while he was here (Usually about 10-15 service came a year). They take advantage of the fact that they monopolize in this area and don't care because of it. One last thing... Use a PAID VPN and set up OPENVPN on your own router. The new business model of these Finland p companies is based around selling your data to third parties. Since dear old Congress let Net Neutrality lapse, this is legal. They can throttle your bandwidth as well now. Free VPNS ARE NOT FREE. NOTHING IS FREE. THEY SELL YOU'RE DATA.

After lots of tech support I finally reached a tech who knew exactly what was necessary.  It took 3 days but Comcast hung in there with lots of suggestions.  The fix involved reinstalling the printer as a network printer...this involves entering the home network name and password.  These are known as SSID and Network key in the printer language.

One person told me I could get another modem. When I went to the store, the kid who helped me told me differently. He said I could use these XFi pods. When I asked where they were, he pointed at the wall. He finally showed me where they were. While ringing me up, he took a personal call on his cell phone. I called Comcast when I got home and that person said that they could not send me another modem. She said that the pods would work but also told me about a Comcast compatible modem. I have installed the pods and they won‚Äôt activate. There are no instructions in the package they came in. They will not activate. I was told they would activate wirelessly.

The only reason it was given 4/5 stars is due to the fact that it will not show service outages within this app. Outages are only shown within the xFinity My Account app while the xFi app will log you out and try to get connected to a new router while the service is down. Also, I would like to see more than just 30 min, 1 hour, and 2 hours for the pause capabilities. It would be really great to have the option of setting a pause time for certain days similar to the bedtime option. If those two issues were to change or maybe the xFi and My Account app were combined then it would be perfect!

The only reason I took one star away was because figuring out what device was connected, assigning it, and naming it was a bit challenging...and having to change the password on all the devices. But I LOVE the bedtime feature and the ability to encourage my kids to get outside more when the WiFi is off. Also, monitoring who is using the WiFi the most üò≥...there‚Äôs accountability in that. So, not to come off as a controlling parent, but from one who hopes her children learn how to interact with human beings face to face and not through Roblox üôÑ, this is a great tool for parents.

Like the improvements for better descriptions of connected devices so that a customer can really know what is attached to their network. However......I wish the system would permit a two-step verification layer within the app....so that any unwanted devices could totally be stopped from attaching to your network without the owner‚Äôs permission. Also wish that the info for devices in this app would automatically update and transfer to the regular my Xfinity app. Unfortunately you have to duplicate your information and assignments of devices a second time.

1493	1178765645	utility	3	The idea behind this app is great. I love that I can set bedtimes and pause WiFi at will. The problem is that the app is slow or malfunctioning. When I choose pause or unpause device it moves to a screen that says ‚Äúpausing (or unpausing) device please give us a moment‚Äù... 10 minutes later the circle is still swirling, the action still not completed. I have to close the app and reopen it and even then it sometimes takes 2 or 3 closing and reopenings to get the WiFi to pause or unpause. I can cut the time down by immediately closing and reopening the app instead of waiting but again, it takes multiple tries. First world problems, I know. Maybe it‚Äôs an issue with the internet rather than the app but I‚Äôm inclined to believe it‚Äôs the app since we have zero internet problems on any of the 16 devices that use the WiFi	negative

I‚Äôm forever checking the app to turn off different tv‚Äôs or computers or tablets because it‚Äôs still running the data after the devices are turned off. Every month I‚Äôm getting a warning that I‚Äôm close to my data overage. So I have to make it a part of a daily hourly routine to keep checking, and I‚Äôm on the highest data plan, it‚Äôs ridiculous.

 Then I found out that now, (September 2nd, 2019) that they‚Äôre adding a $20 surcharge for ‚ÄúHD streaming‚Äù for folks with unlimited data. (THAT IS NOT SOMETHING I SIGNED UP FOR - AND I MAY FIGHT THIS) 

Let me ask you this, Comcast, how many channels really don‚Äôt have HD? Really? Does it cost you THAT much extra to sneak in yet another surcharge??? We paid a lot for 3 pods. Currently both upstairs pods are ‚Äúonline‚Äù and working fine (according to the app) but neither myself or my daughter can get online upstairs. OUR WALLS ARE THIN, PLUS WE HAVE A POD IN EACH ROOM. 

THEN I started to search for my incoming/expectant gift cards - which is an option on the app (kudos for that) HOWEVER, THERE IS NO RECORD OF MY # or GIFT CARD STATUS. I will be calling you VERY soon!!!!

Hey 
Anyhoo, I discovered after the fact (after I signed up) that Xfinity is just using Verizon‚Äôs air ‚Äúspace‚Äù or whatever the hell you call it. AT&T was better than Verizon. Bottom line.

As you may know, quarantine had caused all school to be online, so I have been posting everything on google classroom. Little did I know that half the things I post don‚Äôt even go through to my students, or that they can‚Äôt find the work, or that they can‚Äôt turn it in, or that they can‚Äôt even do it because it‚Äôs to laggy, I could keep going. Almost all of my students, even the smarter ones , have complained to me about it, and I didn‚Äôt understand where they were coming from until I got it myself. It‚Äôs terrible! Nothing works like it should, and it‚Äôs a horrible layout for the work. Over half of my students have complained to me that it is stressing them out and giving them anxiety. ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù You ask? Well, I didn‚Äôt know either until I downloaded it. The layout is so bad! You see all the work at once, it is unorganized, and you cannot find work. Seeing all the work in an unorganized and messy fashion would give anyone anxiety, but especially youngsters, and even more so when they don‚Äôt have a teacher to ask for help. I just want to help my students be successful and do there work, and this is NOT the way to do it. You may not understand now, but once you get this horrendous app, you will know what I mean.	negative
1502	924620788	education	1	Hello, The reason WHY I rate this app one ‚òÜ is because it‚Äôs laggy, and doesn‚Äôt get the work done. Also I got some feed back from my students and they stated the following ‚ÄúIt gives me anxiety‚Äù ‚ÄúIt gives me stressed‚Äù and ‚ÄúConfuses me and is too laggy‚Äù. What‚Äôs worse is that there‚Äôs not an option for ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt do work‚Äù. Like the one thing needed to actually try to make this a successful platform is having a ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt do work button‚Äù. This is coming from a 8th grade teacher, even the app is complicated to figure out! Students haven‚Äôt been doing their work either because, like I said the app is too complicated to figure out. Okay, you may be confused on the part where the student said ‚ÄúIt gives me anxiety‚Äù. What the student meant is the layout of the work, just seeing all the work given to him just as he opens the app pressures him stresses him out which been recently also been reported again from a Female student. During quarantine my students been worried scared and all of that and this app is NOT HELPING. You have to fix the system like a button that says ‚ÄúDo your work‚Äù then brings you to a assignment (The first one of the listing‚Äù then AFTER you‚Äôre done with that assignment there‚Äôs 2 buttons that appear which is ‚ÄúRedo assignment‚Äù OR ‚ÄúContinue to next assignment‚Äù. What I just said would make the app a WHOLE LOT BETTER.	negative
1503	924620788	education	3	"Notifications, I no longer receive notifications when my teachers post. I‚Äôve made sure it‚Äôs not turned off in setting but they are all on.
Multiple apps, even when I downloaded google classroom for middle school, I never enjoyed having to download multiple tedious apps for a simple task. I wish y‚Äôall could find a way to combine all of the google apps so it is just an overall better experience for a student.
Glitching, when doing assignments on my phone or school iPad it sometimes glitches. When I‚Äôm doing assignments, taking test, looking at the to do list.  
Processing. After have to download multiple apps processing is the worst thing about this app. It takes too long to open a doc, try to edit a slide, even logging in is a hassle. I know my district takes an extra step in securing our data but trying to log in takes a 3 minute minimum in loading alone.
Those are my top 4 mishaps I wish could get fixed. I do understand having multiple apps would be a big fix, and notifications may have to do with something in settings, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not rating it below a 3. But I hope this app can run fast and smoother soon."	positive
1504	924620788	education	3	I‚Äôve been reading the reviews of this app and I am seriously NOT impressed. Why is the app so glitchy? Why does it crash so often? These are questions people ask themselves. Here‚Äôs a question for the PRODUCERS. DID you realize how trashy this app is? True or False? I have a feeling the answer is true but you won‚Äôt do anything about it. I understand with the Quarantine in the coronavirus you can‚Äôt basically do anything but when it‚Äôs all changes and it‚Äôs back to normal I expect to see some serious updates no more crashes no more lagging and especially no more glitches. As a student I am tired of reading these terrible terrible reviews, I expect, that adults would want the kids to learn. This app is terrible. I cannot find anything. NOTHING you hear. I expect to get a reply back and if I don‚Äôt I will be going ballistic! This app is so infuriating sometimes. Well I give this app a review with three stars because it is partially my fault. I am very on organized and I often go off task. But you producers have made a serious problem. This app is very trashy with its glitches and lagging, and I am tired of it. Be grateful it isn‚Äôt a review of one star!	negative
1505	924620788	education	1	As a student in a strict family, I don't have a laptop. That means since my teachers post online assignments on my phone, I have to go to Google Classroom on my phone. This wouldn't be much of a problem if it weren't for the crashes! When I first downloaded it, it was working like a dream. I could do all my assignments properly, I was caught up with my work, and I could easily see what was due (This was before school was cancelled). But when we had a lot of assignments for quarantine, it started to crash every so often. This wasn't too annoying, because this only happened once a week. But recently, I couldn't even open the app! Every time I try, it goes to the Google Classroom loading screen for 15 seconds, then brings me back to my home screen! I have tried EVERYTHING to get the app up and running again. Deleting the app then redownloading it, making sure all my background apps were closed, you name it! I looked online and saw that MANY other people have my exact same problem! It is so hard to catch up on schoolwork now, since I have to rely on my family's phones. Please, either fix this horrible problem or delete this app from the app store. My grades are depending on it!	negative
1506	924620788	education	1	First of all, its very laggy. There‚Äôs been several times when I was just logging in to look at my to-do list, and the app lagged... and it was very slow. Crashing, crashing, crashing. Over and over. A lot of times I‚Äôve been typing in a document for an essay, and it lags out, and either duplicates every letter I typed or just crashes. Second of all, It‚Äôs not organizable at all. Not only does it lag, but when I look at my to-do list, and its all scrambled up. All I want is sections and folders. That would be so much easier. Third, the emails are stupid. I get emails for assignments that I would see anyways. I log in to do work everyday. And I‚Äôm okay with graded assignment emails, thats fine, but the  emails just fill up my inbox. I‚Äôm talking to teachers and students most of the time. I‚Äôm tutoring someone and they email me to schedule time and dates. At this point, thats more important to me than my own grades, making sure other people have good grades. Assignments where I just have to write down some words sources and a bibliography page are easy, and again, I check assignments on google classroom anyways, and I think I speak for a lot of people when i say that the emails are unnecessary and stupid.	positive
1507	924620788	education	1	The app is resourceful tool don‚Äôt get me wrong, but as time has gone on the bugs have been more noticeable and making work much harder then it has to be. For one thing the app will most of the time send you a message saying a teacher has recently posted work, but if you go from the notifications to the app the following of the two will happen either the work/details for the assignment will me non-existent or the app will crash. Another thing is posting assignments, it takes honestly 2 mins to summit a photo for work that doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot, but when you multiply assignments due and the teachers are giving you work that takes most of the day it tends to become annoying and a waste of time. The last major point I want to make is power of the app, this a mostly the teachers fault, but it gives the teacher a lot power and to post whatever they want and assume that we will understand, I have some teachers that in-class we will just read from a text book, but now since we are at home learning it‚Äôs 3 essays a day; yes that mostly falls on the teacher, but the app is allow them to post 3 large pieces of work.	positive
1508	924620788	education	2	Google Classroom is a great tool that I love using for my classes, but the teacher login on Google Classroom is missing too many features. One big one is the To Do feature. I‚Äôm not sure why it‚Äôs included on the desktop version, but not the app. It‚Äôs extremely useful for me. Sometimes I use the desktop version and app at the same time on two devices. The desktop version offers the features I want except for one, which is being able to edit a copy of the student‚Äôs work by writing on it and returning it. I‚Äôd love if this were an option on the desktop version because I have a touchscreen chrome book. But back to the app... there are a ton of bugs lately. It doesn‚Äôt show that any student has turned in work even if I know there are students that have. It also shows two copies off all of my assignments... one is published and the other is a draft. It does not show this on the desktop version because I only had one copy of the assignment and no additional drafts. Basically the app needs a lot of work, but I like the idea of having my classroom available on mobile.	positive
1509	924620788	education	1	I am a educator, and as you all know due to this quarantine period us teachers are required to post assignments on Google Classroom. Now, at first things were well not too many difficulties with the app except a small glitch that kept signing me out of my account. Either way, I could deal with it. That‚Äôs when things went down hill. First of all, to check on students work I will use my cellular device as a more convenient option. At times I will press the app and I stays on the opening screen for long periods of time. I‚Äôve let it sit for over 4 minutes. If I don‚Äôt wait and close the app, then reopen it won‚Äôt work either. The app opens the closes, just cutting me off. So that‚Äôs number one. Second of all, for some reason things are being handed in and posted later than when you turn it in. I‚Äôve tried for myself. I posted an assignment at 2:00 PM on the dot, yet it went through at 5. This is a big problem, then I have to elongate the due date which is not good because I have a schedule I‚Äôm following. Not only this but I found many other bugs in the app, I will spend a whole day if continue to complain. So please google, fix this. This is ludicrous.	negative
1510	924620788	education	1	The google classroom is an organizer‚Äôs worst nightmare. There are multiple places for teachers or others to post assignments for students; therefore,  making it difficult for parents to easily navigate to find assignments, to-do lists, and announcements. The app does have one good quality with the ability to communicate with the administrator in a private chat; however, if you have notifications set in your devices it would alert you of the response but not let you read it until much later. This app is incredibly disjointed and seems to try and make it easier by allowing operators to have freedom in the setting not realizing that it creates more chaos than needed. Class work does not transfers over to to-do lists so students are not able to see all of the work assigned. In To-do tab, the student has the ability of to make things as done and take them off the list of things to do; but, in Classwork (most of the same assignments because they are not transferred over to the differ section of the platform) items are not enabled to be crossed off. They are slightly discolored but not enough to really set them apart from the rest of the assignments.	positive
1511	924620788	education	1	Some people on here are saying, well you guys are blaming this all on the teachers so why take down google classroom because they aren‚Äôt doing anything. Um well google classroom is super glitchy I don‚Äôt get notifications and some assignments that I do need to turn in don‚Äôt show up the whole thing, which brings the teachers into this where a student finished their work but on the teachers end it doesn‚Äôt show anything which brings my grade down. I thought you guys wanted us to promote or graduate, we can‚Äôt do that with these low grades that we are getting because of something stupid. If google classroom gets taken down we can go more old school where we have more paper assignments, where it‚Äôs easier for the students, who don‚Äôt need to worry about any glitches and know whenever they turn in their work it is all complete and nothing will change the second you turn in the papers. Your hand or the paper won‚Äôt make a glitch. If google classroom gets deleted, I won‚Äôt have a huge problem with that, it makes us students more reliable and we know what we have or what will turn in when us ourselves hand these papers into our teachers. Thank you :)	positive

1513	924620788	education	1	This app stresses me out. There‚Äôs horrible organization and very little communication between teachers and student. This app is constantly glitching. Even though there‚Äôs an unsubmit button, google classroom has a double verification for you to submit your assignments, leaving me needing to refresh the page to know I submitted the assignment correctly. This is a problem because this app doesn‚Äôt get rid of anything so you have no choice except load EVERYTHING at once, my internet slows down when I have to keep refreshing the page over the laziest design I have ever seen in any app. My WiFi is figuratively going to burst into flames every time I attempt to use this app. Google classroom is designed so I have to open so many different tabs, for just one assignment. I get frustrated about the time I waste with the lack of options there is when compared to WORD or EXEL. I could be using Microsoft and be able to get the job done before google classroom can even load. Do not download this app, it‚Äôll take way too much data then it‚Äôs worth and I have unlimited. Google classroom is a waste of space on my home screen and in the App Store.	negative
1514	924620788	education	1	It has potential however it wasn‚Äôt executed properly. The format is very cluttered and lacks a dark mode. The app also tends to frequently crash and glitch out. When too many students are in a classroom you can‚Äôt even open it without the app crashing or everything glitching out and freezing. On top of that assignment details, the private comment section and the turn in button tend to glitch out and merge together making completing tasks very difficult or impossible. Especially when filling out surveys. Notifications flood my device spamming my email inbox to where I can never receive important emails as they are pushed out and mixed up. The amount of emails I‚Äôve missed from administrators, teachers and my academic coaches is ridiculous due to the confusion. On top of that even teachers have difficult using this program due to its limitations. You can only attach google documents to it and when any other document (such as word or PowerPoint) it refuses to work. Along side file sizing issues.  In conclusion it‚Äôs very disorganized, overwhelming and poorly functioning. Would not recommend.	negative
1515	924620788	education	5	Using this for my class during the pandemic has been a godsend. Once a teacher masters how to organize it and use it, the students can navigate through their assignments easily. I have 2nd graders who are completing their assignments independently using this app.  I have had NO complaints from their parents and they also love the immediate feedback to the email. As a parent using it for my children I love it as well. I can see what is turned in and know that a record of it is kept instead of it possibly getting lost by there teacher or misplaced by my child. I know many students are complaining about the workload and how it is unorganized, but none of that has anything to do with the app itself. It‚Äôs their teacher who is still learning how to use it. Keep up the good work and ignore all the kids complaining really about their teachers and not the app.	positive
1516	924620788	education	1	Ok so, let‚Äôs get this straight. This is one of the apps that are SOO glitchy. what happens is that when i‚Äôm trying to turn something in via adobe scanner, it never shows up. only the assignments i haven‚Äôt submitted at all, they show up. but assignments i have unsubmitted NEVER show up. so i have to do the process of emailing it to myself.. copying the link.. pasting the link to turn it in.. and then re-submitting it. another thing about this is that sometimes teachers give one assignment, but they have a description on what to do for each day. i have never known what to do at the end of the week with those types of assignments. i also hate how we can‚Äôt organize the way we see all of the assignments, and that when i turn stuff in via adobe scanner, i have to wait SOOO long for the scan to pop up so i can turn it in. i‚Äôm not saying adobe scanner is bad, it‚Äôs really good and i use it for multiple things, but google classroom is just bad at having the scans submitted to it. not to mention how i have 3 bars, yet it takes like 15 seconds to load. 1 star, don‚Äôt like it, and never will.	negative
1517	924620788	education	2	"I have used a Google classroom since schools closed for the pandemic.  I was really liking it until one day, I needed to check something and my usual iPad wasn‚Äôt handy.  I grabbed an old iPad and realized I hadn‚Äôt installed the app.  No bother, I just went to my classroom through my browser.  What a wonder! Instead of icons for the assignments, there were thumbnails!  I could actually see that I had uploaded the correct photo! And, my photo uploads took less than 1/5 the time.
‚ÄúWell, fine,‚Äù I thought.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just go through the browser on my good iPad from now on.‚Äù No such luck.  It reverted to the app when I tried to open it in my browser.  I removed the app from my good iPad, and lo-and-behold I get the good version again from my browser. 
So, I added a shortcut to my homepage. 
Question, shouldn‚Äôt the app be better and have better features than accessing through my browser? Please improve the app to be as good or better than the browser version.
I LOVE Google Classroom, I just don‚Äôt like the app."	positive
1518	924620788	education	3	Everyday we take attendance, and it takes so long to load into my class, and my internet is completely fine. Since i am a new york student, it is much harder in my opinion, we already got our spring break canceled. And it‚Äôs so hard to do work, like this is new to us. Teachers work so hard to teach us how to do things in google classroom by making videos and all that, but some people are using different kinds of devices, so it works differently. And when ever i try to add a attachment, it won‚Äôt let me. I had some trouble sending something to my teacher, now it is marked as missing. And it lags so much, it shuts off my device. Now my device is broken, and i can‚Äôt go renew it because of the coronavirus. It‚Äôs so hard to do work! Some people are rating this app a 1 star so it gets deleted off the app store because of their laziness, but what if we will have to redo a grade. Or maybe even get our summer canceled! Trust me, in new york, that is 60% possible.	negative
1519	924620788	education	1	I am a student and im sure like many of you i have been very studious in previous years of school, however I usually wouldn‚Äôt mind the occasional visit to google classroom. It had its laggy moment and times things didn‚Äôt go as planned but I figured it was better than not. Now that online school has taken over I can see where I was wrong. It was only slightly annoying at first but after countless emails to my teachers having them resend me the codes to their class after being kicked out for no apparent reason, the lag and complications ive had while using this app nearly every day has become detrimental to my ability to retain information and I suppose what im trying to say is that the mishaps i have using this app are more of a distraction to my learning than someone shouting the n-word in a zoom class. I dont know if the world can do any better in the sense of online assignments but Ive reached a point where I believe i would be better off learning without it so for it to be temporarily removed and worked on would be ideal for both my shcool work and my sanity.	positive
1520	924620788	education	1	It‚Äôs not a good app it is very slow and on iPad iPhone and any mobile devise it is very slow and won‚Äôt let you do much on it unless you have a pc or laptop it glitches and is not very helpful when I submit work or mark it as done it sometimes will not mark as done or do anything my teachers do not use it often because it is not very reliable at all and not every thing will send through I do not recommend this app at all and I am very upset that people are still using this app and I fell bad for the people that have to use it every day and hope and pray that it will finally work it should most definitely get taken off the App Store also when my social studies teacher post Links the link do not always work and I can never count on them and my math teacher needs us to print out papers and google classroom will not work and it is very annoying and hard to use and depend on this app is definite not recommend for all students or any students who have to work with the app or students that need to use the app every day or every so often	negative
1521	924620788	education	1	"I understand why this app is getting so much hate, and that‚Äôs because it lags and sometimes I try to save my work but it lags and kicks me out and it‚Äôs not my WiFi because it have 2 cable boxes of WiFi at my house and they work perfectly fine and my phone and my computer are brand new so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the problem! Also the lag is unbelievable it‚Äôs just horrible it sometimes doesn‚Äôt upload the work that my teachers have sent and it doesn‚Äôt also doesn‚Äôt put some videos that are important for me to do my work for online class so I don‚Äôt undersrand why it does that. Also my mom is a teacher and she says that it really doesn‚Äôt let her post some stuff because of the lag and sometimes her students can‚Äôt even get work done because it doesn‚Äôt let them watch the vid that my mom put out. So I clearly understand why this app is getting so much hate at this time since everyone is using the app and have been there for hours and having some difficulties with it and it‚Äôs not WiFi I think that it is the app!

1522	924620788	education	3	"Google Classroom is a wonderful app. I like how it‚Äôs helping me organize my work during this time. However, there is a slight concern about assignments. When I submit my work, it randomly gets reset. I thought this was going to be a one time thing, so I let it slide. I did my work again, and it still reset. I contacted my teacher and they told me that my school email is required to complete it. I redid the third time, and the same thing happened again. I don‚Äôt know if this is a glitch, or could be my teacher‚Äôs mistake, but please, look in on this. It has recently taken a lot of my time to have to either take pictures of it or put it on google docs. I want to be able to get it done right away on the site and I don‚Äôt want to have to make backups incase if this happens again. 
(I also assumed that the timing was the issue as well, but even with me doing the assignment straight away in 35 minutes, it still did the same thing.)"	positive
1523	924620788	education	1	Google classroom is not the greatest app to use. You wonder why I may ask, well it‚Äôs because the app glitches a lot when I use it. The assignments are overflowing my google classroom and it‚Äôs making it hard for me to do my work. It keeps messing things up for me. When I need to click on a pacific thing on google classroom it does something else instead. I sometimes can‚Äôt see the assignments that the teachers put up on google classroom because it glitches and doesn‚Äôt work, I even sometimes have to refresh google classroom because it‚Äôs not working, I have to do it at least three times in order for it to work. Also google classroom is slow the internet at my house is good nothing is wrong with the internet, it‚Äôs google classroom that‚Äôd the problem I want to click on something it takes forever for it to load. Again I have to wait for amour of time in order for it to take me to that assignment I want to do. Its like I don‚Äôt have other assignments I have to do . There for google classroom is not the best app there is.	neutral
1524	924620788	education	5	I first started using Google Classroom in the 8th grade, and now this year due to the coronavirus, my school is using it again. From the first time I used it, I loved it because of how easy it was for me to complete my assignments. During the time in 8th grade only my English teacher used this technique. Having my assignments and all on google classroom this year had been very pleasant. Although my teachers do send out a lot of work for us to do, the app has been helpful. To those who are rating this app a 1, trying to ‚Äútake it out of the App Store‚Äù, it‚Äôll still be on the website since this is by GoogleüòÇ also they‚Äôll be reading your compliments and come to a conclusion that there isn‚Äôt anything wrong with the app, but there is something wrong with you. Anyways stay home and be safe ppl.	positive
1525	924620788	education	5	The only reason people are rating this app 1 star is because they don‚Äôt want to do any more work. But, if you think about it it‚Äôll just be harder without it. Do you think teachers are actually going to stop giving us work once Google Classroom is taken down? They‚Äôre probably going to just email us worksheets that we‚Äôd have to print out which would just be more work for us. They could probably just find another loophole. Just think before you make your rating and think about the bad things and how much harder getting work done will be. Without google classroom we‚Äôll just have to do a bunch of stuff on paper. There is no point in continuing rating this one star. If you really want to do work on paper all the time then be my guest, rate this 1 star.	negative
1526	924620788	education	1	Hi, I‚Äôm a student and I had to download this app for class because of quarantine. Recently my family has been struggling, struggling with work, money, food, WiFi, storage.. etc. With the WiFi and storage part, I can‚Äôt use the app because of my bad WiFi and my old device can hold this app because of the storage issues. Not to mention from a work perspective it‚Äôs extremely difficult because of how messy it is, there are so many ways I wish I could improve how this layout is. Do you know how many times I almost had a heart attack because I couldn‚Äôt find something that was due or thought something was due sooner than it was because of how messy this is. I just wish there was a way for people to customize it better or be more accessible to people like me, I‚Äôm a good student, I‚Äôm not trying to gloat but I‚Äôm a smart student and I get good grades, I don‚Äôt want this app to bring my potential down especially because this whole situation is so tough already.

1527	924620788	education	4	I am not giving this review to get it taken down I just want it fixed ( I still want it to be taken down and I am not a lazy, non-working student for those of you that leave 5star reviews) I have 17 classes on google classroom (no I can‚Äôt unenroll in any of them)and they are constantly being updated by teachers. So any time I need to get on to google classroom it takes 30minutes to even log in (no it is not my internet) and another 30 to get into a class. Plz fix and compact classrooms by limiting all weekly turn in assignments and limit the postings too. And by the way I have read many 5 star reviews and most of them are either teachers or kids who call out the 1star reviewers for being lazy. Well they are being honest this app needs to be completely changed or taken down for its many problems. Please take down, thank you	positive
1528	924620788	education	1	As we all know, we all have to use google classroom as a teaching method because of the pandemic. I‚Äôm a 5th grade student going to sixth grade next year and I‚Äôm usually an a student. When we started this new teaching method I literally get notificated every 0.5 seconds on what I have to do for each class and hear this, I got a notification at fricking 10 pm telling me that I have to do a project. I was outraged and extremely mad. Like I was sleeping and I get a notification at 10 pm! My grades are going down and I‚Äôm worried about my education. I did way better at real school. I know, I know, it‚Äôs technically not google classrooms fault on this but it is pretty laggy on my iPad Pro! There is just loads of bugs and I am annoyed. This is a message that goes to all teachers and I‚Äôm saying that you should give us a break like c‚Äômon. It‚Äôs crazy on how I get so many notifications in just one day. I really hope things get better and I hope all students agree with me because this is outrageous. Thank you for your time.	positive
1529	924620788	education	4	"Ok so uh I‚Äôm a freshman in high school and this will probably be the only review I write ever... but I think that google classroom is alright. The amount of work I get isn‚Äôt based off the app, but the teachers, however the way the app handles the work load could be better. I‚Äôve noticed a few glitches, such as the app opening to the wrong assignment or getting a notification too late, even after I already saw the assignment. 

I also think the way the class feed is organized is a bit chaotic. There should be a way to filter the feed for incomplete assignments or for announcements (other than the to-do button because I think it‚Äôs for all classes idk) Because announcements and work are grouped together, it makes me think there‚Äôs a lot more work and it stresses me out. I don‚Äôt know if the teachers have the ability to organize it better or not but yea. 

It works fine for online school, although it‚Äôs a bit slow and glitchy. I think the main problem is the fact it feels disorganized and all of the different things (announcement, discussions, etc.) look too similar in color, so it gets confusing. I think I would like it better if there were different streams for things.

Also is there a way to get a Google PDF into a Docs because that annoys me."	negative

Since they can‚Äôt figure out how to post assignments they end up posting them wrong just causing the student more stress. The students now have to find the assignment and figure out how to complete it . Every time I go to do work I can never do it because it‚Äôs always posted wrong or the links won‚Äôt work or something. Also the ‚Äúturn in‚Äù feature I hate it because sometimes i‚Äôll forget to submit it and then it will say I did it late, when really I did it on time and all the teacher has to do is click on it. The ‚Äústream‚Äù vs ‚Äúassignments‚Äù parts are confusing too because if your teacher post it as an assignment it won‚Äôt show up on your stream, it will only show up in a little box on the side. The little box on the side only tells you that you have to do it, from there you have to figure out where to find it. In conclusion I hate this app!	negative

1532	924620788	education	5	Okay so I‚Äôm a 9th grader and this app is the only way teachers can connect and assign homework to the students. It‚Äôs laid out well so that you can easily access everything you need to and not get confused. I have had minimum problems with the app crashing and if it does I just refresh it. Without the use of this app I would be way more stressed because the other apps teachers have to work with students are not good quality and confusing. I get the whole ‚Äúteenagers rating life 360‚Äù at one star because it deserves one star, but this app deserves more than that and it is actually useful. Most ratings talk about getting more homework because of the app but it‚Äôs the teachers who assign homework so either with or without the app you would still have work to do.	positive
1533	924620788	education	5	Google Classroom‚Äôs organization and workload is truly up to how your teacher sets it up. The app has many neat features for assignments, announcements, questions and videos. After learning how to navigate the app, I really think this has helped my class stay connected and continue learning during COVID19. Unfortunately, there are students complaining about workload.... that‚Äôs up to your teachers and districts. Not Google Classroom. Your teachers care about you and don‚Äôt want you to fall behind. They have a job, too, and understand the stress and severity of this situation. Find a balance for your day-it will help your mental health. Even if Google Classroom glitches or if you have a big workload- I‚Äôm sure your teacher would understand if you reach out to them.	positive
1534	924620788	education	2	As a student, I like to know what I need to work on, when it should be done, and notifications when the assignments are posted so I could focus on other things. (Like enjoying my younger years and whatnot.) but now, ever since the update which happened around the end of 6th and the start of 7th grade, it is all unorganized.I have not been getting notification of assignments for some reason, which mean I have to individually check every which is a hassle, also in my social studies class, there were apparently 3 assignments that were due LAST WEEK. Also because of quarantine, I‚Äôm even more unorganized because of the stress of the work that my teacher bombshell me on Monday. So please, all I‚Äôm asking is that there should be more organization, like having the ability to place assignments in a calendar to allow for more flexibility and better management of assignments. (Thats a pretty good idea.) so please, fit it or I might fail this semester. Peace.	positive
1535	924620788	education	5	WOOHOO! We are making our way back up to higher stars! :D This is a really good app just because corona virus is going on doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt have to do work if you don‚Äôt like google classroom don‚Äôt be rude and vote it one star just so it can go off the App Store. Some other children want to be educated too so they don‚Äôt fail in life! If you are a adult and your voting it one star that is rude and not good parenting because if you don‚Äôt want your child Educated just don‚Äôt vote it off be a better person and do what you gotta do. If you don‚Äôt like this app at all find another app and if the app gets off the App Store sorry children who want to be educated. It‚Äôs not nice that older people like voting it one star when they are out of school! This is my opinion and it could be others!	positive
1536	924620788	education	5	This app is extremely helpful and useful. All 7 of my highschool teachers have posted all of my assignments and they are quite frankly very easy to find. I am however very disgusted with the amount of hate this app is receiving, and it is mainly from ungrateful children who don‚Äôt want to be doing online school. We all need to come together as a community and as a whole and appreciate the technology we are given to complete our work and finish our education this school year. I for one am very greatful for this app and all the hard work my teachers are putting into my education. Please stop eating this app poorly just because you are lazy and do not want to complete the work. I assure you that rating it low is not going to just automatically remove it from the App Store.	negative
1537	924620788	education	5	i understand that other students say that we are in a pandemic and schools shouldn‚Äôt be giving us schoolwork, which i partially agree with, but this won‚Äôt be solved by removing 1 of the many apps used for education. my school has switched over to using an app called canvas, and we only use google classroom for band. having this app removed won‚Äôt fix any problems, it might make them worse. i use google classroom to make classes with my friends, about common interests, etc., and if we remove that, i won‚Äôt be able to connect with my friends in the same way. instead of removing the method of handing out schoolwork, the problem will be solved if y  it take it up with the schools and superintendents. because after the pandemic is over, and if google classroom does get removed, i doubt we will get it back. the problem isn‚Äôt the app, google classroom, the problem is that these students don‚Äôt want schoolwork. i hate to break it to you, but there are so many adults out here who still have to work, and they have more work to do than you. don‚Äôt vote this app one star because it isn‚Äôt going to turn out good for any of us, in the long run.	negative
1538	924620788	education	1	This is coming from the perspective of a student, so bear in mind, I‚Äôm only speaking from the perspective of someone receiving assignments, not making assignments, or managing a classroom.  This app is pretty flawed, on mobile it‚Äôs weird when you need to do an assignment using google drive, google docs, or google slides. Instead of having a unique inbox for personal comments and replies, you have to visit a specific class and specific assignment.  On mobile, I can‚Äôt see a list of the stuff I need to do, like on desktop.  When I check on the to do section, there are tons of random assignments that we did in class which are turned in and graded, where, even if I mark as done now, attach all the work I did, it won‚Äôt matter because it was the last semester, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible now or it needs to be added, but to do should have a section for late assignments and assignments that we actually need to do, which are a higher priority. Thank you, I hope this review does some good.	positive
1539	924620788	education	5	Overall it‚Äôs a good concept to keep the app running but it is so limited from a student‚Äôs perspective and doesn‚Äôt have enough features. Sometimes my teachers will post an a reminder or something optional on the classroom and because my mom has reminders on for her if I don‚Äôt in the assignment it comes up as missing. I understand this is really helpful for if anyone had actually missed and assignment and to alert parents but there should be another option for ‚Äúannouncement‚Äù or something because my mom has always had me keep school as my top priorities and it caused an argument for no reason. Please check this out and take note that sometimes people perceive things differently so there should be a wider variety of options for teachers to post.	negative
1540	924620788	education	1	"This one star rating isn‚Äôt on Google Classroom as a resource, but rather the app‚Äôs functionality.

As a student, I think Google Classroom is a great resource to teachers and students alike, especially in these difficult and trying times. I have used it on my computer for four years with no problem whatsoever. However, the purpose of a review on the App Store is a review of the App itself, not just the utility or program, which is something I believe many other reviews are missing. 

This app is completely inaccessible on my phone, an iPhone 11 updated to the latest iOS. Every time I attempt to load the app, I am stuck on an almost blank, completely inactive screen that just has the app‚Äôs sprite in the background. I understand that due to increased demand, there will ultimately be a high amount of traffic; however, this does not excuse the fact that this app is incompatible with what seems to be a sizable portion of devices, including my own. It is Google‚Äôs responsibility to address this issue, more so in a time like this. There should be no justifiable reason why a new, completely up-to-date phone on decent WiFi cannot load a fairly simplistic app.

If I cannot load the app with these standards, than how is someone with a less powerful phone, with less powerful internet, who completely relies on that device to get an education... how are they supposed to deal with this?"	positive
1541	924620788	education	1	This app lags to much and it‚Äôs hard to do most assignments. Even teachers thinks this app is hard to use or work with because even tho we are in quarantine most kids can‚Äôt log on to this app- It also gives me a very hard time when i try login in and it has nothing to do with the password- it‚Äôs the app. i get literally 100+ notifications even at 1 in the morning. even on weekends. y‚Äôall should put a time limit on the app so teachers cannot post after 11. not to sound dramatic or anything but this app literally gives me and my friends break downs. teachers can‚Äôt even explain to us what we a learning or our new lessons. But yeh even my teachers complain about how they don‚Äôt like this app it‚Äôs to much and it‚Äôs making us fail just because the app lags majority of the time. i love using technology and stuff but this app makes me just wanna go back to schoolü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.Also the app crashes so much. and gives a lotttt of people anxiety. witch is horrible.	negative
1542	924620788	education	1	"My school is using Google Classroom during the COVID-19 epidemic, and using the app on the website is actually decent, though there are some issues there, too. But the app is seriously useless. The only thing it can be used for is to post assignments. But there‚Äôs some problem with its ability to communicate with the rest of the google classroom web features. It can‚Äôt display any of the comments you or your students put on assignments. It doesn‚Äôt even show them if you post one from the app itself. It is incapable of accessing the work students submit until days afterwards. And it doesn‚Äôt work for students, either.

My low-income students were given iPads by the NYC Department of Education, we are asked to use Google Classroom, and the Google Classroom app for iPad doesn‚Äôt even work. Are we supposed to believe Google is too low on money to hire enough software engineers? This creates issues for our most vulnerable students."	negative
1543	924620788	education	1	I‚Äôm sorry but this app has trouble carrying out even basic functionality. It‚Äôs a pretty simple platform with limited layers and it still glitches and freezes constantly. It keeps duplicating my assignments so that I can‚Äôt view my students‚Äô comments because for whatever reason they attach to the ‚Äúdraft‚Äù version instead of the published version. My third graders and their parents are repeatedly contacting me over issues they‚Äôre having with viewing videos, uploading content, and simply using the features. It constantly crashes, it doesn‚Äôt open correctly, and frankly it makes an already challenging time even harder since our whole teaching/school world revolves around GC functioning appropriately. I really feel for the students providing feedback that it doesn‚Äôt work well for them either. These poor kids are already stressed out enough as it is, it‚Äôs a shame we have to add this to their lists too. Fix the issues!!!	negative
1544	924620788	education	1	Not just because there are a ton bugs I the app it takes way too long to download. When I try to post something for my students the app freezes up and I have to re-download it! Many of my students have frequently had to re-download the app. And on and on iPhone The app is hard to navigate. Now my school system LCPS has had to switch off of this disgrace of an app! The older updates were better because the app was way simpler. All my students had no trouble, and there were no BUGS! I also know other teachers around the district that have also had problems with the app. Apparently it‚Äôs not just me, look at the hundreds of 1 star reviews! Finally the most important part of my review is to tell everyone how easy it is to log in to someone else‚Äôs account. If you go to the top of the main bar to switch classes you can see all of the other accounts that you can get into at the top. Terrible features that they should remove immediately!	negative
1545	924620788	education	1	We‚Äôre in a crisis right now. Teachers from EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL decide to assign more homework than they did when we used to go to school. We are all going through problems right now. Grades are going down because of the Corona Virus. We are all stuck inside with our families. The whole world is stressed out over a deadly virus. We have to take care of ourselves and not be on the computer 7/24 doing work EVERYDAY and still get a bad grade. We can‚Äôt go outside and relax anymore because we DON‚ÄôT HAVE ENOUGH TIME. Students are all tired of doing work outside campus. Teachers, if you‚Äôre reading this, please don‚Äôt assign any work that takes up a long time. We have 6-7 classes full of work we need to complete everyday, trust me, we don‚Äôt have patience to teach ourselves new units and do our work + we have to download a bunch of learning apps which takes up a lot of space. This should be a time where everyone rests and just get all the stress out of their body and feel more stressed!!	negative
1546	924620788	education	1	"I‚Äôm just gonna start off by saying, why would you make google classroom? It is literally just a torture device for kids or whatever age is using it. My first thing is what even is this for? Just to waste my time? If it is a beautiful day outside or even if it‚Äôs rainy, or snowing, or, if I get lucky, sunny, I‚Äôd still want to go outside because I‚Äôd want to get some fresh air and have fun outside enjoying my day. But instead, I have to sit inside all day being miserable for hours at a time, doing something that is a complete waste of time. For example, what the heck even is nearpod. Seriously. I could go on forever listing all the stupid and unreasonable things that are on this dumpster fire that you‚Äôd call Google Classroom. Like really, give me one good reason I should be doing this instead of being in a good mood and enjoying my day. On top of all that, we HAVE TO do these stupid zoom meetings that are also a waste of time because I have to go over what, what‚Äôs 3/4x5/9? Overall, I think Google Classroom is a torture device and a complete waste of time for kids or whatever age is using it. Please take this message seriously and same for all the other messages similar to this one, which I strongly agree with. Thank you for reading this, take it seriously.

Regretfully,

I‚Äôm not saying anything about my name.

1547	924620788	education	5	This app is great! People are rating it 1 star because they want it off the app store so nobody has to do work. I read a few that are acting like teachers. I know because their usernames/nicknames are not very ‚Äúteacher-like.‚Äù Now, I‚Äôm a student and using this app to do work, and honestly, it gets the work done! It isn‚Äôt laggy or anything. Most of the 1 star ratings are false ratings and people just trying to remove this from the app store. Please don‚Äôt do this, Google worked hard to make this app for teachers and students, don‚Äôt ruin their hard work. But anyways, definitely recommend for teachers during quarantine or any online homework when we go back to school. This app deserves no hate.	positive
1548	924620788	education	1	This app is so slow and the layout is confusing. The To-Do section is a mess, it will have assignment that was due months ago at the top of the section and then an assignment that is due today at the bottom. This makes the To-Do list pointless. The app will send me a notification hours after a teacher has posted something, and will rarely send me a notification when I get a private comment. I don‚Äôt know if this is just my internet being slow or the app, but sometimes it will show that I have submitted a assignment but it in reality it hasn‚Äôt. This shows that I have turned in a project late and I lose points, which affects my grades. If they could send me a notification when I don‚Äôt have something turned in, this would be a huge improvement for me. The only reason people still use Google Classroom is because there isn‚Äôt really another virtual classroom app. This app will be forgotten once a new virtual classroom app is made.	positive
1549	924620788	education	1	I‚Äôve used this many times during school but I never got a good look at this app. Now since we are in quarantine I now have to use this app daily for school assessments, I‚Äôve seen some very surprising glitches while at work. First, every time one of my teachers comment on an assignment I can never see them and I get a bad grade on it, some people in my classes have the same problems too. Second, the class from last year that I‚Äôm not in anymore I still get class work even though I took myself out of the class; I talk to that teacher but she didn‚Äôt know what to do we did everything we could. The last thing is some of the assignments from different classes get jumbled around into a different classroom, I don‚Äôt k ow if it has to do with the device I‚Äôm using but it happens to everything I use. Overall I am VERY disappointed into this, who ever made this app needs to work more on it because this isn‚Äôt what I expected and the glitches are disgusting!!!	negative
1550	561625752	utility	5	I‚Äôve been with Tmobile for close nearly 15 years and throughout those years with work I‚Äôve had to elect to either change providers or carry two cell phones. I have always chosen to have the two phones in order to weigh out the differences and Tmobile has always come up on top. First off, I travel a ton. Tmobile provides the BEST global service that no other carrier is even close to offering. I always tell my friends who travel that they should switch to Tmobile if they‚Äôre worried about overhead costs when they travel for a long period of time. In addition, if you‚Äôre in any sort of financial struggle (which I can admit toüôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) they offer payment plans when your bill is due which is such a helpful tool to help lighten any financial stress that you may have. Lastly.. although I‚Äôve noticed that the strength of signal may fluctuate in certain cities that I‚Äôve lived in (ie. San Francisco- signal is stronger than Verizon and AT&T vs Miami signal is rather spotty vs the others), the customer service is always 100% on point. Throughout all of these years as a devoted customer, I will continue to promote Tmobile to my friends and family solely based on my experience.	positive
1551	561625752	utility	3	Well I enjoy T-Mobile but I have to say the first day we came in we where so mad with att horrible service and being priced so high so we went and talked to these guys who told us we could buy 1 phone get 1 free and they would pay off our att phones and our price would be $60 cheaper than we where paying . Next day we come in talk to the Manager to get set up everything has changed we where misquoted and didn‚Äôt meet certain qualifications on turning in our old phones ( never told that before ) and the bill went way up because we now have to pay full price for the new phones so I am happy we left att but now we are paying more than we did with them and the internet speed and connection is way worse if I‚Äôm not using my home wifi or work wifi most things take a long long time to load. All in all we felt like we got played by used car salesman with the whole bait and switch method but we got put in a tough spot and had no choice . We spent over a decade with att paying over $200 a month and we will do the same for T-Mobile if they show they are better than them but currently we are not very impressed Staff is nice but prices and deals currently do not seem to be in our favor.	positive
1552	561625752	utility	5	Service is good but it could do a lot better. Friday when I was in the hospital in a waiting area, everyone that was sitting around me had service except me and that mad very upset. When I asked everyone around me who was their carrier, they all said Verizon. I have been a very loyal customer to Tmobile and I feel like they should feel the same way I do and treat their customers like loyal customers because we spend our hard earned money with you to have top notch service without any delays or no service at all at some times. This is unacceptable. If Verizon can provide excellent service to their customers then I know Tmobile can do the same. You need to listen very carefully and take our complaints very serious because if you take to long to provide the excellent kind of service that we all want and expect from you, it might be too late, and Verizon will be the one taking all of your gambling chips off the table. Treat your customers with respect and loyalty and they will not abandon you, because we are loyal to you right now, but not for long if we keep receiving bad service. We will abandon ship quick.	positive

The hearing impaired and deaf get cheated every time . Sad too . Now I just keep what have and cross fingers hoping it will work some day . So just using it mostly for texting and when it does work I can call or talk on it some days . There should be a special program for the hearing impaired and deaf community . So far no cell company has anything for us üòî. Last visit to apple is we don‚Äôt know who to fix it other then to tell you to upgrade your phone or upgrade your hearing device . Well hearing device is upgraded at a cost of 5,000 4 yrs ago just paid it off . Can‚Äôt afford to upgrade the phone with such huge down payments and large monthly payments . Sure wished a cell company thought as much about the hearing impaired and deaf as much as they do about the hearing folks .	negative
1554	561625752	utility	5	I love autonomy & this app let's me do most things without needing to talk with a CSR. If I do need one, I can make a call directly from the app (or have someone call me back). Their customer service has improved greatly over the years which has caused me to stay with them (and this says a lot coming from a non-loyalist like moi). Fun fact: when I switched back to T-mobile in May 2017, their sales rep told me that I qualified for the carrier switch. When I tried to use the credit, I was told that I can't because I used it already and it's a once in a lifetime offer. A supervisor listened to the initial sales rep recording and credited my account $250 for the mistake. I was worried that my switch was a mistake at that point but overall I'm glad that I stuck with them. Another great point is that I never have a dropped call anymore and my internet is fast...sometimes more preferable to my regularly disconnecting Spectrum internet. Plus, I now have my mom on a T-mobile plan and, although she's still getting used to having unlimited internet, she loves it and is very happy that she switched from  us cellular.	positive
1555	561625752	utility	4	I switched from Sprint so I called and did it over the phone. Got the sim in the mail with little instructions. The rep didn‚Äôt ask if I wanted my number ported or insurance on my phone. Biggest issue was explaining the process and what to expect was anemic. When it came time to port the number I had to get sprint and T on the phone.  The process was full of missinformation and dropping the ball on both carriers part.  The T rep heard me pay off my phone with sprint but didn‚Äôt offer insurance and I admittedly didn‚Äôt think about it.  3 weeks later my phone was stolen.  She also heard that the bill had to be paid off (which wasn‚Äôt true accord to the sprint store) but she still told me it would take 24 hrs to port the number despite knowing my sprint bill wasn‚Äôt paid off. I was without service for 5 days that turned into almost two weeks somehow.  You have to repeat intentions, don‚Äôt assume anything, expect to be given inaccurate and incomplete information so you can get get the change to happen.  There were lots of other issues but that the majority that will color your experience of changing carriers.	neutral

1557	561625752	utility	2	I would give a full five star rating to T-Mobile because most of their services are great but one big problem. When I am at my shop/house I cannot receive signal and they cannot seem to fix that for me I have to rely on my Wi-Fi in order to give me a phone signal at my home/shop. With today‚Äôs technology you would think that someone from their engineer department would fix this problem due to the fact that I have complained about it numerous times but no one has been able to successfully fix the problem. So I suppose for now I will have to continue to use it on Wi-Fi which I have to pay for every month so that I can have phone service at my place. They also tell me I am right between three cellular towers but I just can‚Äôt seem to zero in on the signal to give me a good phone signal at my place. So I am just stuck with Wi-Fi. Maybe just might get to the right place at T-Mobile and someone will care about it and see if they can actually repair and fix the problem sometimes it takes no will to get a little oil in order to get something done maybe just might reach the person at the top. Outside of that T-Mobile is a wonderful company.	negative

Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Dubai, Bahrain, New Delhi, Shanghai, Berlin... yeah, basically the same.  Yes, the phone calls work great and are of great quality.  Online access? Not so much...
Domestically half of my T-Mobile WiFi calls drop?  Not sure why, showing a strong signal, both WiFi and phone signal, it connect, then it drops.  I feel like T-Mobile is so big on having great deals for new customers that they‚Äôre forgetting the current customers. Basically they seem to be focusing on quantity versus quality.

1559	561625752	utility	1	You have made it complicated and frustratingly difficult for me to upgrade and get a new iPhone. I paid a monthly fee for the upgrade program just to find out I was being manipulated out of that money. At this point I still have an iPhone 8 from almost 2 years ago and the value of that phone has gone down considerably which makes it much more costly for me to get a reasonable trade-in credit. I have gone to three different t-mobile stores and I am told three different ways to handle my discrepancies during which the value of my phone has gone down considerably. I was told I could use the trade in valued at $500 as my payment towards the new iPhone, the next store told me I would only receive $350 and it would only be used on the credited portion of the bill and I would have to pay the other half up front which was roughly $500, i forget the exact dollar amount, but most people do not have $500 to put down on a new phone. And I certainly don‚Äôt. At this point I believe it‚Äôs in my best interest to transfer my wireless service to a different provider, the other large providers have offered some outstanding switch over deals with considerably lower monthly payments.	positive

As soon as the rep found out we could afford to pay for the iPhones, his attitude changes right away. He spent about $3,000 and they had a special buy one iPhone get one free, which the rep did not tell us about. The rep just took are money and sent us on our way. I asked him how to get a Netflix account and he just said get the app and figure it out. It wasn‚Äôt until I received a phone call from someone‚Äôs at T-Mobile, his name was Cyrus. He called me and ask about my experience and just fixed every problem I had. He actually cared that I took my business to T-mobile. The only reason I‚Äôm giving a 5 star review is because of the gentleman that took the time to call me. The service I got at the actual T-mobile store was even a 1 star service. They were rude and just cared that we could afford to pay for the phones upfront.	positive

Ridiculous I been with them for 5 years and have 5 lines but I guess that didn‚Äôt matter either.  Service is ok I don‚Äôt go a lot of dead zones anyways and they do try to train every my matters.  Usually if I speak to management I get what I want.  Oh and in the United States only.  The Philippines people usually don‚Äôt care to please you but if you get transferred back to the US the Americans will help you more because it‚Äôs a US based company with US residents paying their payroll. Anyways I like the t mobile deals better than any other carrier.  Other than that I can go to another carrier but I‚Äôm lazy or unless I‚Äôm provoked to I will otherwise this works. But not the best.	positive

Apparently all three of the numbers on my family account were linked together, which causes a problem with this new app. If you have a family plan make sure the numbers are unlinked and you will be able to see all of the numbers on your family plan in the app and manage them as you would expect. 

Original review:

The updated t-mobile app Is visually appealing, but functionally worthless. The problems began when it misidentified which account I am using-I am the primary account holder but it recognized my phone as another phone on my family account, and refused to allow me to view or make changes to my account. The app update notes state that T-Mobile is listening, so if that is truly the case, please fix this app and make it more like the old app-which was actually very useful if a little dull in the style department. At this point in time the app is completely worthless and I might as well use the website."	positive

But, what really stands out is the consistent customer service which is consumer and people friendly, as it is helpful.  Today I had a memorable talk with one of your customer service representatives, Suzanne, who is a delightful and gracious person that exceeded all expectations for someone like me who was unclear and anxious about my account and its usage.  Suzanne has much insight, knowledge and perception to clarify and enlighten people, and all in a way that ‚Äúbuilds up‚Äù others.  She walked me through every step in a way that I could remember everything after our call had ended!  That‚Äôs saying a lot.
I have not encountered such overall skill since my days of being a senior officer in the U.S.Navy!  My recommendation is that she be retained and advanced in the company, as her performance reveals yet more talents that many other companies would covet.  I write these words with joy and gratitude. 
Sincerely,

I use to have cricket service never had difficulty, but wanted more down load speed and the accessory app said t mobile was better so who or what can I believe, customer service is friendly but I got miss leading information which put me into a bind and still not resolved since of October of last year and it is ongoing I say where is my new signal booster as I was to get it in December, but as said I assume I could get a yagi outdoor signal booster probably be better then the t mobile signal booster how do I find out, then it reference to getting a free one or paying for one,,,WOW... so I got various miss leading information then how do I qualify the truth	positive

It was about $45 a month, so I‚Äôm paying more right now for service, however that comes with Wi-Fi calling, unlimited data up to 50 (FIFTY) GBs unlike their 22 GB speed cap, hotspot, and more. And it‚Äôs $90 a month, which includes my iPhone XS payment since they had a trade in deal for my old 7. The service is just as good as AT&T was in my area, and in some places better, our area has T-Mobile‚Äôs new ‚Äú5G‚Äù network (I know, it‚Äôs not 5G technically) while AT&T‚Äôs 5G-E network is not here yet, and phone call quality is light years ahead. I mean, I called my Fianc√© (Who I also converted lol) and she picked up immediately, it didn‚Äôt even have time to ring. That‚Äôs amazing!

I can‚Äôt believe I can actually be wowed by any company now days it feels as though everywhere I go customer service has died and people out there working in the world are just showing up to their jobs for the money without the customer in mind whatsoever until I had the chance to speak with T-Mobile business customer service skills and personal touch! I am sooooo excited to be a part of this network, not only do I get real-time amazing people that are caring & knowledgeable which is just a cherry on top! I also get amazing international service and rates!! That alone made me switch back into T-Mobile! I was soooo devestated for switching out of it for a better phone deal -so I thought- but T-Mobile stood way beyond and over all my expectations!

They have been ahead of the curve for the 4 years that I have had service with them but my latest experience just made such a positive impression. They were friendly and super respectful of my time and called me back as promised to followup on an issue on the following date. 

Their team of experts is something new to me and I hope they continue to be able to support all Tmobile customers because they are just that great. You can apparently call, text or schedule an appointment with them through this app. I didn‚Äôt have to use this app to setup the appointment since I had the regular customer phone number but this same great service was provided.

No putting the customer on hold while waiting a representative becomes free? Nope! Not here. Instead they just connected me directly and offered an alternative to let you connect to the automated system... haha.

Employees:
Alex the representative who just finished helping me was just amazing. So friendly, honestly looking to help me out and from what she told me it sounds like Tmobile takes good care of her too. Before she ended the call, she double checked if there was anything else she could help with to reduce call backs which is a win-win situation for Tmobile and for the customer.

I‚Äôm a happy Tmobile customer. Thank you so much! And reception has been great throughout the Bay Area :)"	positive

Then it asked for the‚Äù cc number ‚Äú, I put it in. The app doesn‚Äôt allow for spaces in between sets of 4 numbers, however it requires it. Therefore, every time I entered my cc # it would ask me over and over for a ‚Äúvalid‚Äù cc. It is valid!!!! It is a Visa! I tried several times. I tried submitting it with the rest of the info in tact including the cc #, it just asked again for a valid cc #. I tried to message support, but after waiting 18 minutes to connect, I went to my desktop, signed in to T-mobile on that and was able to space my numbers on that. Please fix the APP. When it asks for the name, the keyboard does allow for spacing, however on the cc # info the keyboard does not. Therefore, I was unable to pay using the APP. Thanks. Hopefully, they can fix the problem with an update. My phone is only 2 weeks old and has the correct software. Thanks again"	positive

They both were terrific examples of perfect representatives for T Mobile. They were friendly yet professional, patient but efficient, helpful but not pushy. Plus they both made me feel as if they cared about my business and then proved it by setting up my military discount, processing my phone rebate, setting up all 3 phones and even setting up the new Iphone when the Apple rep who sold it to me at the Apple store was unable to!! All with a smile!  I have met with or spoke to numerous representatives of ATT, Cricket, Sprint, andMobile One during this process of selecting a new cell provider, and None would have prompted me to take this time to recognize their efforts. Please thank Joseph and Ken for me and take notice of these two valuable employees of T Mobile.  Thanks guys.  A very happy and satisfied customer. Roy Knight	positive
1571	561625752	utility	5	It has improved much better than the previous version that they actually rewrote the app instead of a patchy web-converted version. It also integrated well with iMessage for Chat instead of using the browser chat. It makes the user experience much better. The customer representatives are much better than most other companies in answering the questions with the right answer. They really treat the loyal customers well by offering deals for added features in the plan. It‚Äôs a good company to stay with. I think the web team should work on improving the self-help FAQ to provide a link to solve the problem in addition to the answer explain the question, it should provide a link for the next step to solve the problem, such as when the data rate has been exceeded, it would help to provide an option to the link to change plans to increase the data rate.	positive

It‚Äôs easy to change your plan, set up auto pay, pay early, get stuff with t mobile Tuesday‚Äôs, their plan has data and text in Japan for when I visit, and it‚Äôs easy to get in contact with a worker for any questions or concerns. The only gripe I have is 70% of the time the t mobile app doesn‚Äôt work for me. The app is where you can do most of the things listed above in the palm of your hand. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling it, restarting my phone, and waiting just in case it was maintenance. But this problem has lasted for months for me. Even after upgrading to a new phone it happens. And sometimes when I do get in it kicks me out. I usually end up having to log in on my desktop computer at home. I don‚Äôt see myself ever switching to a new carrier after my experience at t-mobile, but I just wish the app was more smooth so everything would work seamlessly.	positive

I was walking in & he smiled and greeted me. I told him I was interested in upgrading to the XS Max because I really didn‚Äôt like how the new 11 Pro looked. He didn‚Äôt try to convince me to buy the 11 like some phone companies try to do when a newer version of a phone comes out.. I had a lot of questions and he answered all of them & even showed me the cool new features on the new phone that I was upgrading too. The store closed at 8 & I was there a little after 8 but he never complained about staying after to help me set up my new phone. Long story short, I left the store very happy with the customer service that was provided & even was given one of his business cards. I will definitely be back to this location.

The texting mainly helps  us keep in touch with each other while we‚Äôre traveling, but we also use it to keep in touch with friends and family while away. The data is limited and downloads are slow, but it works well enough for google maps other small downloads. We use wifi in the room to stream video, flight check-ins and heavier research on destinations. We also use Wifi Calling to phone home and other people in the US. We do all of this for no extra charges to our existing plan.  

In the past, we had Verizon and would have to pay an extra $10  per day for a travel pass for each line. It was a hassle to try coordinate the least amount of days for the charge and we still had a big bill when we got home."	positive

There was an unfortunate issue with our local store representative during the purchase and we were not give accurate information. After several visits over the next few months to the store, another representative provided us transparency and identified the issue with the original purchase. I spoke with a T-Mobile customer service rep on the 800 phone number and he was most helpful sending me the documents needed to proceed. A few hours later the new store manager called me promised a quick resolution so that we would be satisfied. Through the efforts of a responsive local store rep, the national customer service rep and the new store manager...in less than 24 hrs later our issue was resolved and the financial credit due was applied to our account.

Not only am I paying way less than I had been when I was with AT&T but I have better service with way more options than I did before I made my switch but also their App is just unbelievably awesome. I love how I can manage my account within the App instead of contacting CSR and if I ever whined up needing to contact them I can do so within the App or better yet have them call me back as well.

1578	561625752	utility	5	I‚Äôve been with T-Mobile for years now and I‚Äôve never been happier with their service! My monthly bill is low and I get UNLIMITED everything. Only thing I would recommend is not buying phone protectors or phone cases from their stores. They are great but they are expensive and they add it to your monthly bill until it‚Äôs paid off. But I‚Äôm not mad at them for it, it‚Äôs a way for them to make more money, and if you don‚Äôt have the money to spend on $100 phone case it‚Äôs good that you can pay it in monthly installments. Just me personally I‚Äôd like to buy my phone case and pay it off all at once, so that my monthly bill is as low as possible. But I will not shed any negativity about T-Mobile because I do honestly love their service. The app is so easy to use and if you‚Äôre ever in a tight spot you can always make payment arrangements on your bill! I would recommend T-Mobile to all my friends and family!	positive

We have traveled across the U.S. and there are very few places (for example, rural Wyoming) that we had minimal or no service. The customer service reps are always super respectful and accommodating! T-Mobile truly goes above and beyond for their customers. Transparency with prices is key and T-Mobile hits the nail on the head! And it doesn‚Äôt hurt that just for being a customer, (no additional fees), Netflix is FREE and there‚Äôs an awesome T-Mobile Tuesday‚Äôs app that gives away freebies and offers discounts for various places (like FREE Dunkin Donuts coffee, to discounted movie tickets, FREE whoppers, FREE weekly tacos from Taco Bell and more)!

T-Mobile formerly provided excellent international data at fair prices. However they‚Äôve started to enforce hidden limits that make roaming difficult, and they sell upgrades that don‚Äôt deliver what‚Äôs promised or reasonable. For example, I recently paid $50 for a 15GB international data pass. I used about 6GB of it. When I returned home, I was threatened with service termination because my international usage exceeded my domestic usage. I use mainly WiFi in the US so have very low domestic usage. It seems fraudulent to sell 15GB of data, rigged so that if you actually use that data, your service can be terminated. Other than that, it‚Äôs a great company. ;)"	positive

I could rarely get a signal in my own home office in the basement, and sitting in my own living room was a one bar at best proposition. I asked them often about this problem and got no results. 

Having been thoroughly been indoctrinated to the ‚ÄúWe have the best network‚Äù mantra, I begrudgingly fulfilled my role as a V-minion. Paying large sums of money for less than expected results, was sticking in my craw. I had a 6 gig data plan and payed handsomely a few times when I exceeded my allowance. When I asked about changing plans I was offered adding more gigs for more money. Putting me at nearly $200/ mo. 

So I did some research and found T Mobile was tied for 2nd place for best network. I decided to look into their packages. They had one just for me, (the Tech savvy old guy) so I signed up. Hoping for the best. 

So far, I have upgraded to unlimited everything, got  2 for one deal on new phones for my wife and I, been treated with respect as a customer, and best of all I have 3 solid bars in my living room and  2-3 bars signal IN MY BASEMENT!!  Oh the delight in my soul is euphoric.

Which is already 172, (140 for the T-Mobile one, the the rest is paying for other phones as well, I have a family.) The T mobile app doesn‚Äôt show I have an iPhone 7 anymore (was my old phone but now I‚Äôve given it to another family member) but it says it has been replaced by a space grey iPhone XS 512 GB. Uhhhh.... what? No matter how many times I refresh, it says the same thing. The app used to be fine until that popped up. Also, I can‚Äôt see how much the bill is. It keeps showing I‚Äôm paying for my iPhone 7 (which I am, Bc I didn‚Äôt finish paying it off, not a problem) but it doesn‚Äôt show my iPhone XS.

Their plans and prices are unbeatable in my opinion. They‚Äôve always been there to help me and are the only company that when I have a complaint, they don‚Äôt automatically assume I‚Äôm trying to get over them. They sit, lists, investigate in a very neutral matter. This is really crucial when dealing with their customers. BUT, this app man, has to be the worst thing I‚Äôve ever used. It doesn‚Äôt load, half the features or more don‚Äôt work. For years now, I have yet to be able to view my detailed bill on the app. I constantly have to contact support. And the chat thing on the app, horrible. By the time they respond to me, I‚Äôm always asleep. I don‚Äôt even write reviews. My horrible experience pushed me to do so.	negative

And send me to a blank white page. I cannot go any further. I have spoke with so many that they have try to help me and even in their system it says I am the primary account holder with the correct pin but on the app it would not set me as one or let me go any further! They even have to get some people to work on this technical issues and couldnt work it out on their end. I hate this app! Because of this i cant access or manage my billing or edit any of my account information! Terrible app! Its been months and nothing has change! Terrible update and bad app!	negative

We were in Lincoln Nebraska visiting my daughter and her husband, Who had just opened two new lines, Plus equipment with you two days before. She also gave my daughter information on maybe if I brought my five company lines over we could save more money. So after talking with my daughter I decided to see what January could do. When it was all said and done with a few hiccups, I was able to bring all five of my business lines to you with new equipment and save money, now that‚Äôs good business!. January showed patients where most people would have a meltdown! She is smart she is focused and she is very funny! She also has integrity, She told us what she could do and made it happen. When we all look back at this experience we will have a good feeling about it, And save money. üëç Like I said that‚Äôs good business. And when it was over she said thank you and welcome to T-Mobile.	positive

Sales reps did everything at the store and even helped me handle AT&T when AT&T tried to give me misinformation about switching. I had a minor phone setting problem after I left then store and T-Mobile fixed it. I encountered a location where I was not getting cell service (dead spot) where I spend so much of my time so I called T-Mobile. Within hours I had service at that location! Customer service has been amazing and cellphone and data service great so far! The family app also saves me money because I do not have to use a third-party service to keep up with families phone activity. I am saving $1,400 a year By using T-Mobile over AT&T!!	positive
1592	561625752	utility	5	"Since going to T-Mobile my dropped calls are almost non-existent. If you are connected to a WiFi connection and the tower signal is weak my phone automatically switches to WiFi and calls are excellent quality. Neither Verizon or Sprint does that. 
The only negative as many others have found when calling customer service in too many cases it is extremely difficult to communicate with the person on the other end. I always ask where they are located. I have spoken to people in the Philippines, South America, Central America, and on a rare occasion the US. 
It is difficult at best to get things accomplished when the person you are speaking to you  cannot properly communicate with you. 
Phone service including calls, text, video calls, and camera I would rate 10/10. 
Customer Service maybe 5/10 at best."	positive
1593	561625752	utility	5	"We switched to T-mobile about three years ago and are incredibly happy about that decision ever since. We live in Los Angeles where the network is just stellar. T-mobile keeps on surprising us with constant new upgrades and even lowered our monthly bill by $10 while increasing their service. 

Whether it is T-mobile Tuesdays that get you $4 movie tickets or upgrading your phone through the app that is actually working they keep exceeding our expectations. I don't see ourselves switch away from T-mobile ever. 

My favorite feature is the ability to use wireless to make phone calls. I have to travel for my job and can call anyone in the U wireless for free. Also while being around the world I can use a very good to 2G or 3G network for free most of the time. I would give six stars if they were available."	positive
1594	561625752	utility	5	My husband and I are extremely happy with T-mobile, their company, the phone selection and their customer service. We do have (on occasion) problems with loading the app to look at our bill, pay a bill, or make changes to our account from the app. However, no technology is perfect and I have been assured by customer service that they are updating the app to fix this. I recommend this company to anyone and everyone looking to pay a bill each month for cel phone service that is exactly the same unless you make changes to your account. We appreciate this tremendously, as this is exactly why we left our precious carrier (bills kept going up each month and could never get a straight answer as to why). Keep up the good work T-mobile. You‚Äôve got a lifetime customer here!	positive
1595	561625752	utility	5	Transferring from Verizon to T-Mobile was such a breeze due to the help and knowledgeable employee Pedro. I was up in the air between AT&T but he sold me with the high speed responses and just breaking down what I needed to know in order to commit to a cell phone company. Two days later I‚Äôm loving the company and what I thought would be a problem  with services hasn‚Äôt been a problem at all, and I was strongly stressing about service wise in the country when I go out of town but it‚Äôs been great to me. I also want to recognize T-Mobile location in Stonebriar mall in Frisco, Texas with the quickness of helping each customers and doing it in such an professional way when it was super busy, the wait wasn‚Äôt long at all, full of positive individual, I‚Äôm very thankful for the crew and Pedro whom made me feel like a special customer.	positive
1596	561625752	utility	5	I have been a customer with TMobile for 6 years. I love the customer service I receive. The true test of excellence in customer service is when there is a problem.  Over the years I have come to respect the caring representatives because they are professionals. I also like the fact that I recognize the different reps I‚Äôm working with because they ‚Äúa team of experts‚Äù that are designated to work with me so I‚Äôve gotten to know some of them over the years and that‚Äôs great!  And, I LOVE the fact that you do not have to punch a bunch to get transferred to a live team member. Instead you are connected immediately. That‚Äôs huge.  That one feature communicates ‚Äúyou are a valued customer.‚Äù The staff  consistently projects this attitude and that‚Äôs why I call it MY TMobile.  I don‚Äôt pay attention to any promotions to switch....my attitude ‚ÄúForget About It!‚Äù	positive
1597	561625752	utility	5	I have been a Tmobile customer for I‚Äôve 12 years. The company has gone through a major change mostly good but customer service level has gone down just a little bit only because the they are having problems getting it right the first time but hey they mean well and eventually get it right just coast me a little time on the phone with the reps. This was not the case 5 years ago. Still love the company and I will try stay loyal forever. Only reason for 4 stars and not five is that they need to train their new customer reps a little better on products like smart watches and and when changes are made to the plan like monthly credits you will on new purchases. But they really really mean well seems like these changes can be complicated for their reps and need a little better training.	positive

This isn't a new update. This is the old clunky app interface you had before the last version which was much faster, smoother and better to look at than this one. Connectivity is a gamble if you're not on WiFi and/or the pages take forever to load. 

What's really bothering me is that I can't review my entire account because it thinks I'm looking at it from my iPad line (for some reason they treat my iPad like a second account ever since I added it to my main account). I have 5 phone lines I can't see or review, including my main phone line which is THE MAIN account line. 
I was told that this particular problem would take several weeks to a month to fix. Really? Y'all need to get your $#!t together if you plan on this Sprint merger working out. I'm sure their customers don't want to an app as messy as this when the time comes."	positive
1599	561625752	utility	2	"I have been with this phone carrier for mor than 3 years and I‚Äôm very disappointed with the service and bills charges.

Every month I‚Äôm always concern on what changes are going to show in my bill due to this company don‚Äôt have a contract, they basically play around with your money adding or increasing your phone insurance as if your is brand new, it doesn‚Äôt matter for them. Regarding this last issue about the phone insurance, I spoke with one their representative to try to understand if my phone is 3 years old they still charging me as it‚Äôs a brand new phone and basically she said that she will contact me back after she discuss my situation with their supervisor and I‚Äôm still waiting for her to call me back...it was two months ago... obviously I tried to reach them multiple times and they just keep putting me on hold and bouncing around, I guess until I give up and continue paying the highest insurance for a crappy phone.

Also regarding service, it‚Äôs the worst, phone turns off, no signal on certain areas, sometimes phone calls do enter or I can call anyone. I have been a customer with Verizon, Sprint and AT&T in the pass and I had never experience anything like this before. 
Basically I‚Äôm decided to pay off my balance of the phone and move back to one of these carrier for a better service even though I would have to start paying a new phone all over again."	negative

Got confirmation that all I needed to do was show up with my phone to get car.  Well, that didn‚Äôt work, pressed ‚Äòpickup my truck‚Äô and ended up in an endless loop of ‚Äòpickup my truck‚Äô - then a message saying I‚Äôd done everything needed for 24/7 mobile pickup and to hit ‚Äòcontinue‚Äô‚Äî and itnjust took me back to ‚Äòpickup my truck.‚Äô  First person at U-Haul said I could just start from scratch, but I mentioned I had a reservation and a contract number.  She refused to answer why there was no truck ready for me or how the app worked.  Just, can‚Äôt help with that.  

Finally got someone to help, they asked for my license and credit card again.  I thought it was unnecessary, but gave them.  Then they realized I was already in the system.  Truck had a gasoline smell inside so they tried switching the car.  Suddenly my license showed invalid (while it had worked 5 minutes earlier and was newly renewed last month).  An hour and a half later, I finally had a truck - and missed all my plans for the evening.  The advice from the rep at U-Haul?  Don‚Äôt use the app next time.  Just call.  It‚Äôs easier.  

This the bad review.  I‚Äôm only giving it 2 stars because the interface was great and had it actually worked, I‚Äôd have been pretty happy."	positive
1601	989307692	travel	1	"If you‚Äôre planning on sticking to any kind of schedule, especially if you have a set time frame for people helping you move, I would not recommend using Uhauls 24/7 or pick up services. Long story short, it took me almost 2 hours past my pick up time to secure my truck. This process included a phone call to the listed help number, who redirected me to the 1800 number, because ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know anything about that app, service, or software‚Äù. I was on hold for over 45 minutes with the 1800 number, which never did connect me to a live person. I finally got in contact with someone through the live chat option in the app. She was able to give me access after a lengthy wait for a response from her. When I asked her who I could speak with about the poor customer service I‚Äôd received thus far, I was sent a generic link to leave a customer review (which led to an error message), then she abruptly ended the chat session. Will not use this service again, and am seriously considering using a different company altogether for my next move. 

Side note: because I lost my help yesterday evening, due to the delay, I had to reach out to another friend this morning who only had a small window of time to help me move. Moving then took me two trips, extra time, and mileage and had to be done on July 4th. I guess holiday celebrations can finally start now..."	positive

2) partway through the process I was asked to provide a phone number and name do someone who could verify my identity. I understand that, but you can collect that information when the reservation is made. At that time we should let people know this is going to be necessary and that you will be calling them. Most people answer their cell phones about half the time anyway, and when it comes from an unknown number even less frequently so Customers need to give the reference  receiving the verification call a heads up. This going to be especially important for an off hours pickup, such as someone picking up at 5 am to beat traffic, etc. Put a reminder about this in the reservation and again in the middle of the check out process.
3) Upon return, no matter how many pictures I took of my dash board, the continue button never became selectable. An employee checked me in. Customer service is good at the El Camino store in Mountain View, CA üôÇ

I contacted U-Haul roadside assist and Jorge contacted me and said he will be right out and get me on my way. Jorge determined there was more damage than just the blown tire and the trailer  could not be repaired at the roadside and could not haul my car. Jorge made arrangements with a local U-Haul facility to replace my broken trailer after hours with one they had on their lot.  A few hours later I was back on the road again towing my car behind me.  I later found out that when Jorge received my call for help, he was leaving for Mexicali to spend Christmas with his family, who was waiting for him to join them.  Jorge didn‚Äôt mention this until he got me taken care of and I had asked him what his plans are for Christmas.  If there were 10 stars to give him I would certainly give them to him. He went above and beyond what a normal person would be expected. I am truly grateful to him and hope he and his family enjoyed their Christmas.  Thanks Jorge!	positive

I would like to note I had made a change to my reservation by changing locations to allow me to use the app to pickup at an earlier time. Unfortunately the person who I spoke with must have never change the location because when I left at 6:00 am this morning it sent me to the wrong location. I kept trying to work with the app but the location settings would not work. After trying for over an hour I called customer service. They told me I was at wrong location and sent me to a different address. So after losing an hour and half on my journey I finally got the truck.  The truck was great and had no issues with it whatsoever. The next problem came when I tried to drop off the truck at the same location I picked it up. The office we closed so I tried to use the app again and it still had me at the previous location. So after calling customer service and pleading with the rep to get a manager to make the the correction I finally we able to drop off the truck another hour and a half later.  So I lost three hours time because U-Haul does not have the capability yet to use the technology they pay for.  I paid for it and lost.  Buyer beware!	negative
1605	989307692	travel	2	"This is my 3rd or 4th time renting a self-pickup Uhaul, and the only time I have not had to call support when attempting to pick up the van, despite following all their instructions online to a T. They REALLY need to figure out their app and take a cue from Zipcar or Getaround by streamlining the pickup process. 

While the idea of being able to rent a Uhaul in the neighborhood without having to go to a rental location is great in theory, the pickup and drop off process take about 10-15 minutes each so be aware this will cut into your rental time. You need to arrive at your pickup time ON THE DOT or your rental will be cancelled. AND you‚Äôll be asked to upload multiple photos of the van, yourself, your drivers license, the odometer, etc. every single time so that a physical person on the other end can manually approve it before the van is unlocked. If your connection is spotty or the app can‚Äôt identify your location, then you should probably just forget about it or expect to spend 20 minutes waiting on the phone with a customer service representative. 

It is such a clunky time-consuming process it almost outweighs the convenience of being able to rent a van in your neighborhood."	positive

Every time I‚Äôd step into a U-Haul location, they‚Äôd be incredibly busy and understaffed or staffed with employees who are less than eager to help....until I met Kristian at the Neptune Beach, FL location. I was having difficulties with the mobile app the first time I tried to use it. He was friendly, professional and eager to help make the process as seamless as possible. This is the second time I used the mobile app and picked up at this location. Kristian was again eager to help make sure I was all set. He had just arrived as I was pulling in and before he even got settled into the start of his work day, he helped take care of getting me on the road. The mobile app worked seamless this time and with Kristian‚Äôs help getting the key from the correct lock box, I was on the road in no time. Upon returning, he was outside and welcomed me in with a wave. I used the app to close out my rental, dropped the key in the drop box and left within 5min. Thanks U-Haul for the excellent app and customer experience!	positive
1607	989307692	travel	1	We picked up truck - it took a few minutes to confirm the info but it was basically easy. I rated it a 5. We dropped it off at another location 2 hours away. It was a Sunday night. They advertised 24/7 drop off. First of all the place wasn‚Äôt where it said. Addresses had been changed and we had to turn around and go several miles in the opposite way. I‚Äôm not sure whose fault that was but it cost us an extra 4.00 in mileage. We got to the location and there was no key drop. / anywhere. We went through the whole process on the phone. Completed the information and it closed out. There was nothing stated about where to put the key. We called the 1-800-uhaul number and after being on hold for a very long time- we spoke to a very nice lady named Leshon.  We were on the phone with her for 29 minutes. She offered as much help as she could. There was just no drop box and the key would not fit between the space on the front door. We hid the key. She documented where we hid it. We will contact the place in the morning and spend a restless night worried that someone will steal that truck! This is a very bad flaw in the system! There simply must be detailed information about where to leave the key. We will never use this system again.	negative
1608	989307692	travel	2	I booked a 26‚Äô truck to be picked up at 9am on a Saturday morning. I arrived a few minutes late and went to do the express online check in which is normally pretty easy and straight forward. Once I received notice of which truck was mine and was able to locate it, I noticed that the truck was blocked in. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me how often things like this happens with this company. They either don‚Äôt have a truck for you when you‚Äôve made a reservation or it isn‚Äôt ready. Why make a reservation if it isn‚Äôt going to be ready?! Regardless, I was able to find a very nice representative to help me with this which should have been a non-issue. He got me all set up so that I could take another truck (that wasn‚Äôt blocked in) which was the same size and nicer in just a couple of minutes then directed me to go inside and tell a manager that he sent me so that she could just hand me the keys. No big deal right?!  Nope! Went inside to see one representative working the desk and 5 people in front of me. What is the point of the express check in?! 30 minutes later waiting in line I was handed the keys and out the door. The employees were nice and helpful but this is just a poorly run company.	positive
1609	989307692	travel	3	I was very dissatisfied because it took two hours to check out the uhaul even though I had a reservation and only two people in front of us. The guy named Carlos was taking a long time and was installing a car onto an auto transport for a different customer for 45 mins when there was people were waiting. When he came back I overheard him mention to the other employee that the previous employee had left his shift an hour early. We requested a certain truck and the lady refused to give the uhaul and said she couldn‚Äôt because her boss won‚Äôt allow it. I told her, ‚ÄúI am the customer and I can go somewhere else‚Äù and she responded, ‚ÄúI had to listen to her manager and not the customer.‚Äù I told her I was going to call the manager. She responded, ‚Äúgo ahead she won‚Äôt answer.‚Äù Then I told her then I would call corporate. Then she changed her mind and gave me the uhaul I wanted. She told me to drop off the uhaul in Pharr 20 miles away from my destination, while there was one located 1.8 miles away. After the 2 hour wait, the U-Haul was dirty. She didn‚Äôt offer to clean it. I had to ask her to clean it. If she expected me to return it cleaned. Which I did.	negative

The first rent wasn‚Äôt in the the same spot that I received, and when I went there driving 45mints there‚Äôs no on can help to attach the trailer, they told me to get smaller ball, I drive back to bring smaller ones and change the pick up location to some place near to me, they told me they need 2‚Äù ball the one that I had before, drive back buy it agin and drive it home to load it, in the trip there was a storm lot of water when I finally get there and I want to unload it I found a water and water damages on my stuff, I called the costumer services they told me to call the round assistant to see where the damages are, some random guy come to my drive way try to take the trailer He accused me of lying because it‚Äôs 80degre and there‚Äôs no rain, he didn‚Äôt show any ID or certificate about who is he and what he is doing, I asked him about my stuff he told me it‚Äôs not his problem his job to take the trailer, I was confused, I called the costumerservices they told me it‚Äôs over due even I rent it on the 21st and he came on the 24th!!

1611	989307692	travel	3	I was given clear instructions on the rules of renting & returning the truck before I left the premises, however, I was not made aware that the return process would be so tedious. Because I was busy moving, I didn't realize I had been sent a text message with a link to use upon the return of the truck. As instructed by the nice lady at the counter, I took pics of the truck, inside & out, as well as the gas hand & the mileage, however, the link I was provided did not allow me to use the pics from my phone gallery. I was to take the pics once I was inside the app & upload them but the only problem with that was I had already locked the truck & returned the key so I ended up taking random pics of the inside of my car because the app wouldn't allow me to move forward without doing so. I will attempt to call first thing Monday morning & explain, though. BUT!! My biggest issue was having to download the U-Haul app & create an account to even do all of that! What happened to the days where I pick up & return the truck & just drop the keys in the drop box?! GEEZ!!	negative
1612	989307692	travel	1	I spent over 2 hours trying to find the location talking with multiple uHaul reps.  I would like to say that a rep Carman finally helped me by being in the line with me for about 45 minutes when I finally was able to drop off the truck.  I would also like to say the rep at 2920 Governers Blvd in Wilmington refused my drop off there when I could not find the 810 south walnut location.  He also proceeded to give me bad directions telling me it was at a BP gas station which was totally inaccurate. I was disconnected multiple times by UHAul while on the phone before reaching Carmen.  The rep at Monroeville also tried to help but was limited in what the could do. The roads to the 810 south walnut location were closed so I had to park in a lot across from Glacial Auto yo return it. The location did not appear safe and I was concerned that I may run into junk yard dogs. But I did find the drop box and returned the key.  I did my best at the photos for the app drop off but I was walking away and did not want to go back while doing the app return process as the location looked dangerous and I just wanted to get out of there. I will only use UHaul again if it‚Äôs an absolute emergency and I have not other reasonable choice.	negative
1613	989307692	travel	1	So many things went wrong when renting this U-Haul this time. We were supposed to get the U-Haul at 7 AM and had to wait till almost 10 AM to pick it up. I was on the phone the night before to make sure I can pick up the U-Haul at 7 AM and someone on the U-Haul phone line told me that would be fine. Then I had to call four different people the day of my pick up. One lady put me on hold for over 20 minutes. Another lady was supposed to get me to talk to a manager and I was on hold and then the phone dropped. I expressed my concerns about everything and how behind this put me with all the people trying to help me move, no one cared at all. To top it off I was told that I could just drop the vehicle off at the drop off center after hours and that I would not have to be there and my father-in-law could drop it off for me. Turns out I had to follow him and do it all with my smart phone. This was such an inconvenient thing with U-Haul and I can‚Äôt believe that they didn‚Äôt make any of this right. I will recommend everyone I work with every friend I know what every family member I have to never use U-Haul and to go with a different company. You lost a really good customer right here.	positive
1614	989307692	travel	1	The self pick up feature on this app is so poorly executed it makes me deeply question the longterm viability of U-Haul as a company. On at least 5 or 6 different occasions I was forced to close this app because it became non responsive, continually told me it was ‚ÄúLoading‚Äù (like to take a picture), or that it has lost internet connectivity (despite this being obviously false) (I am using in an iPhone 8). The driver license verification ‚Äúfeature‚Äù took over 10 minutes to verify. It provided me with 5 or 6 vehicles almost none of which were actually located at the U-Haul facility, one of which was parked in such a way as to make it impossible to drive out. Upon finally finding a vehicle that was actually in this facility, spending 30 minutes opening and closing the app, I finally ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù the process only to wait another 20 minutes to receive keys from the U-Haul facility. I absolutely guarantee I could have been in and out of the U-Haul location in 10 minutes had I gone into the location versus the nearly an hour I spent using this app. That such an obviously flawed and broken system could be delivered for production use is bafflingly ridiculous to me.	negative
1615	989307692	travel	1	I rented a truck at the Longview store. Signed contract with pick up and drop off locations. I was in a time crunch and had a schedule to keep. At some point they changed drop off location that is completely inconvenient both in location and time. When I called store was transferred to customer service where I explained I was at drop off location that I had picked and handed a signed contract stating so. Told me there was no other option than to take it to downtown Olympia location because my drop off had too many trucks. No help at all. I wouldn‚Äôt have rented if I knew I had to drop it off there. So I took it to the new location  clean and full of fuel and received a phone call stating now that I left it there and they were closed so i would possibly be charged for more rental if they dint get there and check it in in time. I also used the U-Haul app and went through appropriate drop off procedures and pictures but Candice still says I am responsible. Totally unprofessional with no help solving problem or customer service attributes whatsoever. I am not a frequent renter but do rent a few times a year.	negative
1616	989307692	travel	1	I thought using the 24/7 feature would cut out some time waiting in the line at a U-Haul location (even if you have an appointment I‚Äôve always experienced a wait) and I only needed the truck for a few hours. It did perfectly fine doing so, but when the return process happened it was a LITERAL nightmare. The app kept quitting and then I had to try to retake the pictures MULTIPLE TIMES. I live in Arizona which equals my helpers and myself sweating in 109 degree weather for an hour outside because the business where we dropped off was closed, and my plan was to call a Lyft after we dropped the truck off. I ended up cancelling my Lyft due to the app quitting during the drop off process and my panic due to waiting on hold for hours between my Dad and I. We both were hung up on after being nice and level-headed with these people who could care less. I tried the online chat after I got somewhere with WiFi but WHAT A STRUGGLE. I will not use U-Haul ever again for lack of customer service. I finally reached someone and they assured me that they would put that the drop-off happened. So stressful and time consuming, $170 for this nonsense never again.	negative
1617	989307692	travel	2	1st the 26‚Äô truck I originally ordered was broke down. Then they sent me 56 miles (one way) to pick up a smaller 20‚Äô truck and a 6x12 trailer. Losing 100 sq ft but charge me the same amount. Well kinda not okay but what made it worse...when I got there they didn‚Äôt have a truck for me. Mind you I‚Äôm in a bind now cause I have people waiting to help me load. I‚Äôve already driven 2 hours out of my way to pick up an imaginary truck.  After an hour and using my ‚ÄúMom voice‚Äù a few times they got me a truck and trailer. The associate was super I will say that he did an amazing job trying to help us. Still charged me the same amount and only gave me $30 off. Mind you I spent gas in my vehicle and used more gas then I should‚Äôve in the UHaul. It was all just pretty overwhelming. Then drop off with the app was easy hard part....locating a good place to park it with out blocking anything. They need to have a more centralized location for drop off then ‚Äúwherever just not there‚Äù type of directions. Still believe for all this trouble we should‚Äôve gotten a little more reimbursement then $30!	positive
1618	989307692	travel	3	"If you‚Äôve never used the service before, there is no instruction/warning on how long or what else to expect. I arrived with no person present for the handoff of pickup/ drop off. I did not know what the next steps were and opened the app and sent a text for what next. Waited 15 min before someone responded. I sent two texts asking what to do with no response. I nearly left the location during the wait time because I had no idea what next.

In the return phase, sent my son to drop keys in the drop box while I opened the app for the return. Realized too late that I needed to take photos of the dash with the fuel and mileage. I knew what they should be as I had calculated the mileage before and had just filled the gas tank to the same as when I picked up. The rest of the photos were not a problem as I was still in the truck, but a better understanding of what the expectation were would have been nice.

Great using technology, but a better outline of the steps would be nice before hand."	positive
1619	989307692	travel	1	I just rented a vehicle.  I was told one price and quoted a different price.   When I picked up the vehicle I said I needed to change the drop off location to another place.  They took down the new location and said that is okay. I called that evening to confirm an they again said it was okay and that they would send me a drop off location.   When I went to the location that I told them o needed to drop it off they had sent me the wrong location. So again I called.  They said they would change it.  They gave me a new location and I headed that way.  Then they said that location could not take the truck. They finally found a location after a total of about a hour on the phone.  I concern everything I want to make sure it has no problems.  This is not my first rental.   I usually use Penske and get a good deal bit this time I wish I did.  Penske would have been so much easier and at the end would have been within 5 dollars of what U-Haul finally charged me.  I would have saved time and fuel with Penske and had a better vehicle.  I will not be going back to U-Haul or even think of trying the again!!!!!!	positive
1620	989307692	travel	1	I was told to download this app so i would have been able to return the rental after closing. I did and made a reservation. When i went to pick up my rental instead they would not allow me to return after hours. They sent me to a second place miles away. The app also says you will avoid waiting in line. Not so. In the second place there was a line and i had to do it all!! Then i still had to lose time answering more questions. Finally a get the rental more than 1 hour after the original reservation time. AND, since i had to travel to a more distant place i had to pay for more miles!!! They told me to take picts of the rental before returning it and send them to show there is no damage. So when i returned i took picts. Then i had to use the app to return, instead of just dropping the keys. Took forever. The app made me take picts again to show the rental was clean. However, there was no way to add picts of the outside showing that there was no damage. You would think that should have been the purpose of the picts!! Anyway, the app crashed twice. I used to like uhaul. Thanks to this app i hate it.	positive

Ended up I had to take a picture of my own license and upload, then fill out information I thought I already filled out online beforehand. Thought that was the cashier‚Äôs job to this, not me. Before I knew it I was a half hour late and I had an hour and a half to move my stuff. 
We were in such a hurry to throw everything in the van and drop off just so we could park the uhaul on time. We were a minute earlier than our drop off time but the app then proceeded to ask us questions and present photo evidence the van was gassed up, met the odometer requirements and that it was clean and tidy before dropping it off. I thought that was someone else‚Äôs job to check, not mine. Especially if they‚Äôre charging me for the time I‚Äôm wasting on their app. I blocked off time to accommodate moving, not to take a half hour test on whether or not I was able to drive and prove the van was clean.

1622	989307692	travel	5	"Hi
I had a very stressful move to plan. I lost my job due to Covid and had to move during this pandemic as a result. The first van I tried to rent from another location did not work out when I went to pick up due to poor customer service so the same day I had to get another rental and fast last minute. Danbury self storage was a god send. Douglas was fast and super attentive while observing all safety precautions of social distancing. He was so friendly and kind which meant so much after my first experience. He also called me when i was on the road to make sure I knew which route to take with a commercial vehicle. His small gestures of kindness meant so much to me. UHaul and Danbury self storage are very lucky to have such an exemplary employee like Douglas. I will return to this location for all my storage and moving needs going forward. Thank you so much. Stay safe.

Once the app wanted a picture of driver license AND passport, and I had to abort the rental. But on the whole this app is highly functional. You can live chat with someone about your questions, and if you close the app in the middle of a chat they will call you to make sure everything is ok. That was super helpful. I‚Äôve used the online truck rental about 4 times now and only once was I annoyed that they asked for info I didn‚Äôt have. The ONLY other issue is that the local U-Haul attendants are often baffled at the online checkin checkout process, and as I‚Äôm writing this the nice lady insisted I take the truck to the checkout line for an official inspection. Ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that. I showed her my return confirmation and walked away.	positive
1624	989307692	travel	1	I booked the truck online and then called the facility to confirm that I could pick it up after hours. I was assured that I could. I went to pick the truck up later that night and the app would not allow me to pick up the vehicle. In addition, no truck had been left in an accessible spot. I then called the customer service number and was told not only could I not pick up the truck after hours, I would not be able to pick it up until 9:00 the next day. Since I needed to be packing cargo by 8:00, that posed a problem. After rearranging my schedule and the schedule of the dozen or so people who were waiting for me. I went to pick up the truck promptly at 9:00. You guessed it. Nobody was there. After about 10 minutes, an employee showed up to open the door. She jumped in, apologized, and tried to get me on my way but it was to no avail because the computer was down. So in the end my 6 am pick up turned in 10 am with a truck that had bad bearings, loose steering, and a transmission that made me wonder if it would make it through the next few hours of local hauling.	negative
1625	989307692	travel	5	The U-Haul app was great but service at the ace hardware location was horrendous.   It took 3 people to get me keys.  The first person tried to check me out but printed paperwork, said he did not know how it worked, and would go get the only other person in the store that new how to take care of the U-Haul business.  Even after he asked the woman to come help me she continued to check out customers who were in line after I was.  I had to ask another person who finally got the woman‚Äôs attention.  When I asked if she would come help me after 20 minutes waiting she was incredibly nasty and acted like I did something wrong.  I had been waiting longer than any other customer and all I needed were my keys since I did the check in through the app.  Terrible customer service; I would never use that location again.	negative
1626	989307692	travel	1	"I rent trailers occasionally, I thought the app would simplify the process (spoiler alert, it didn‚Äôt).
When you book a rental, you enter all of your information, DL photo, payment, click no on all of the add-one that pop up with every step of the process (no U-Haul app I don‚Äôt need two helpers, furniture pad, a trailer hitch and tape with my 4‚Äôx6‚Äô trailer rental)... Then you show up at the U-Haul center and have to give them all of the same stuff you just entered in the app.  It is no quicker than doing the whole rental when you get there, but at least you can find which locations have the equipment you need.
My biggest issue is that even though I have the location settings set to ‚Äúonly when using the app‚Äù, every time I pass a U-HAUL the app send an alert-‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a U-Haul rental center less than a mile away....‚Äù as if I am going to be like ‚ÄúI totally forgot that I need to rent a 24 foot family hauler, thanks for reminding me U-Haul app‚Äù. That tells me this app wasn‚Äôt designed to make the customer experience better, it was designed as spam marketing."	positive
1627	989307692	travel	1	Really expected more given uHaul claims self-checkout, but I actually had to have a person on the phone in order to complete the checkout. I actually couldn‚Äôt do anything regarding my reservation on the app, had to have a person on the phone which again defeats the purpose, for making order changes / updates etc. why even have an app if you still need tele-assistance. Also aggravating that it took 30 minutes every time I called to get someone, but then once I was at my checkout I reallyized it was because the operator stayed on the phone with me for at least a 20 minutes to make sure the car checked out etc, which was great but explains why it takes 30 minutes to get someone (they‚Äôre on the phone with everyone for at lease the 20 minutes it takes to check the vehicle out. All around this just isn‚Äôt an app! Just a bonafide alternative way to call a phone number parading as an app. Wonder how much more business uHaul could do if corrected for this (faster checkout/checkin = more trucks = more reservation at peak time). Get at that $ uHaul!	positive

1629	989307692	travel	1	It usually takes no time to pick up the truck using the app .. this morning .. it was a bit longer then normal as it wanted additional verification. A photo of my license and another photo of myself and my credit card and telephone number wasn‚Äôt enough ... I had to put in my friends telephone.. but he didn‚Äôt have his phone with him.. my concern was what if I didn‚Äôt bring anyone with me ???  So after waiting in the cold we used my Sons phone  .. we got in the truck and drove to our destination finally found parking  and there was no dolly nor protective covers which were ordered . Had to go back to the facility to get the dolly and greeted by some rude ,nasty lady , I should have been the one mad and inconvenienced, not her. Was told to go get the dolly myself in the back, a simple apology would have sufficed.  By the time I got back to the location my friends ended up paying some people to help us load the van. But what a waste of time .. I truly hope I am not charged for these items and U-Haul does the right thing.	positive

I made a reservation online, but when I went to go pick up the the truck, she added some package stuff to my reservation. I told her that it was not something I needed and requested her to remove it. She began arguing that it was not something she did, and cannot make changes to the reservation. Also, she insisted that if she were to make changes to the reservation, she will have to cancel the reservation and I will be left hanging without a truck. At that point, I contacted customer support and customer support told me that it was something that the store did. She treated  me very disrespectfully even though she knew she was trying to rip me off !! Totally disappointed with the level of customer handling !!!	negative
1631	989307692	travel	1	I‚Äôve used the app three times now. Each time took more time than just calling in. Problems: 1) Some employees weren‚Äôt used to having app customers so there was confusion. 2) I had three reservations schedule on the app. I needed to cancel one and it canceled all three. 3) towards the end of one reservation I wanted to go back and change the size of the truck. There was no way to do it. Even stopping and restarting the app filled all the blanks and with my previous information with no obvious way to correct it. I finally had to wipe out all my cookies to successfully start again.  4) There was absolutely no time saved. All the steps at the store were identical to the ones I had before I ever use the app. Actually they were longer because the clerk would begin to ask questions and finally I would say ‚ÄúI already answered those on the app.‚Äú she said, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs a different path for me. Let me see if I can figure it out.‚Äú From now on I will just phone them and like I always did.	negative
1632	989307692	travel	1	I‚Äôm generally enthusiastic about using technology, but the app actually seemed less convenient than just going into the office.  I expected a Silvercar experience which is a super convenient car rental experience.  The first truck specified I couldn‚Äôt find, the second truck the app shown was blocked which required me to go into the office and re-answer questions already answered in the app.  The app required me to take multiple selfies because I was wearing my glasses and it did not notify me of that issue immediately. Upon return you have to enter the mileage and fuel level but also take a picture of the dash to verify that information which seems redundant.  It also requires that you take pictures of the cab and cargo area of the truck to verify cleanliness and the drop off location.  My return was after hours there were others returning around the same time.  They just dropped their keys in the drop box while I‚Äôm using the app and trying to play photographer and get decent pics in low light.	positive
1633	989307692	travel	3	"Love the app for picking up/dropping off when it‚Äôs convenient for us. I would use this service again. Some improvements:
- don‚Äôt re-assign my pick up location without checking first. I had to keep changing it back to a more convenient location and still was not able to pick up where I wanted (despite multiple trucks of the same size parked in their lot)
- offer more drop off locations.. each time I had to re-assign my pick up, the drop off locations changed. Again, the most conveniently located locations were not available. 
- let me preview pick up and drop off steps so I‚Äôm prepared before arriving
- more documentation on contract, ie: reservations will be expired if you show up 2 hrs late, even with mobile check in; gas refueling requirements. I was not able to access my contract and these expectations anywhere. Now I am being charged $30 for gas."	positive
1634	989307692	travel	1	Your check in process clocked as nauseum til I had to enter the office to get an associates help ‚Äî if I had tried to get it outside business hours I would have waited in heat getting nowhere. Your interface logged me in to view my check-in and yet immediately had me log in again in order to check it out, and enter the driver information that I had entered in order to reserve it, photos, numbers and all. Your photo system pulled up the delete photo button over the use photo button so I had to confirm truck cleanliness twice, and when I clicked to show me the lockbox location it closed. I needed human intervention at every automated process of check out and check in, the entire process was clunky and asinine. Your human associates were great but this was the most frustrating app and move experience of my lifetime. I will be telling people this service and the app are godawful and hoping another mover service is nearby the next time I have to move bulk.	positive
1635	989307692	travel	1	First off the Touch ID doesn‚Äôt even work. I don‚Äôt even know why it‚Äôs even on there. Second I don‚Äôt understand why you have to log in twice. I mean you HAVE TO log in once to even access the app. You can‚Äôt jus browse the app. You HAVE TO create an account. Ok no problem. Then you get in there and they ask you to verify all this stuff. So u add all the info. Car, Credit Card, DL etc. you get an 100%. Do you think your good. Nope. So now you want to reserve a trailer (Now keep in mind that you‚Äôve NEVER logged out of the system) and they ask for the vehicle your gonna be using. Which you‚Äôve already added. Do you think it would jus be there since you literally jus logged in NOPE. They want you to log in again in order to have you vehicle be on the drop down box. Which I personally think is crazy. I‚Äôve already been logged in when I first opened the app. Why do I have to log in again 2 seconds later. That needs fixed ASAP. Until then my rating will stay at 1 star.	positive
1636	989307692	travel	1	"It took an hour to get the keys to the truck after I got to my location on Saturday, Sept 28 in Alpharetta, GA. I had to call UHaul several times to change the pickup time and was on hold anywhere from 15-45 minutes each time. The rigmarole that is required to pickup a vehicle after your place is closed is ridiculous! It is very convoluted and complicated. I won‚Äôt ever go through that again. You HAVE to figure out a better process. It shouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near that difficult. I returned the truck to Alcoa, TN just now and it was also somewhat time consuming but MUCH easier than the pickup!! 
Also, the Alcoa location, where I reserved the truck told me that they had my pickup scheduled for after hours but when I called about the time it wasn‚Äôt booked correctly and there were no blankets on the reservation as I had requested and was told was reserved. The truck was great and served my purpose but your reservation and pickup system needs work!!

1637	989307692	travel	1	So far picking up the 26 foot truck was the only pleasant experience. Corral Liquors in Woodriver, IL staff was outstanding, friendly and helpful. However, the staff at Swansea, IL to pick up auto transport was horrible, not helpful at all, and unfriendly. The drop off of the transport in Plano, TX was not good. The young African American young man and African American young lady were rude and not friendly. The young man was very unprofessional. Just plain ridiculous how many times I had to explain I was ONLY DROPPING OFF THE AUTO TRANSPORT FOR TODAY. He was very argumentative with me right in front of other staff and customers. The only thing that saved him was a friendly older white gentleman and a very attentive and friendly/helpful Hispanic man. I think his name was Gabriel. If it had not been for Gabriel and the older gentleman, I would give the overall experience so far a zero! I still have to drop off the 26 foot truck tonight or tomorrow so let‚Äôs see if they can redeem themselves!	negative

We went to the address 2 times and almost crashed due to the snow with the trailer which we had to get rid of because we could not leave it in the driveway any longer even though we were given until the 6th to return it there. But was no where to keep it past today. Nowhere on the sheet or did anyone tell me it was Millenial towing. Once we looked up millenial towing it brought us to the correct place which the address on the sheet took us 20 minutes out of our way.

1640	989307692	travel	1	"U-Haul‚Äôs app is garbage. When it does function users cannot use many of the features it claims to provide.

For example, customers can not modify existing reservations without going through every single step in the reservation process from beginning to end (even if users just want to change one item‚Äîyou have to answer every single question again and again). This would be a minor inconvenience if the app didn‚Äôt keep trying to confirm an order using inaccurate information.

Do you want to confirm your pickup location is exactly the location you selected? Good luck. The app chooses whichever address it wants to use for your pickup location and no matter how many times users correct the mistake, the app changes it back to the wrong information by the time the confirmation e-mail arrives.

Users who attempt to cancel the inaccurate reservation receive a notice stating ‚Äúthis reservation cannot be canceled‚Äù (even though the rental pickup date is 2-months away); forcing users to call customer service (and, of course, the representatives ‚Äúcan‚Äôt see‚Äù the reservation‚Äîor anything about the app or the problems it creates for users).

Marketing an on-line rental reservation app sounds like a good idea. Unfortunately, U-Haul‚Äôs app is garbage because it creates many technical problems for users to try to solve."	neutral

I was trying to be calm and deal with the fact that the phone wasn't being picked up at the drop off location and I wanted to confirm that location and the possibility of a different location that the computer wasn't bringing up but no one is picking up the phone and the service worker at the Green Bay location seem to have a serious problem with that he kept insisting on option that I very politely explained was not one that I was wanting to do.  It worked out of course I just went with the nearest option that the computer presented but it wasn't the place I wanted to drop it off and I was unable to confirm whether another place was possible or allowed.  Other than that it was great service the truck was a bit weird but I'm not used to driving large trucks."	negative
1642	989307692	travel	4	Did not receive all the extras I paid for, reservation was changed late the day before pickup. Because I was in an area where I did not have good service, I would not have been able to access my email if I had waited until I got to the wrong place. Overall, this put my pickup behind schedule. The provider was very nice and accommodating, except that he could not provide all the things I had ordered, like an appliance dolly, and there would have been nowhere in the area to obtain one. Also, I had an outstanding balance due to picking up a work vehicle six years ago, which wS charged to me instead of the company, since I gave my license when I picked it up. It would have been nice to know that six years ago, instead of on hectic moving day.	positive

I tried to talk to the folks where I rented it from however they said they could not help and I should contact road assistance. I did that and 3 hours later I was able to use the truck. I tried to cancel my reservation and was not allowed. I tried to switch vehicles to another in the lot that was not being used but was not allowed. All I was allowed to do was wait. During that wait time I missed a pickup I was to make and every time I tried to talk to a person I either was put on hold or hung up on while being switched to someone that I never was able to speak with. My over all experience was frustrating and very disappointing. I will think twice before renting again with U-Haul. I guess I will need to the other guys next time.	negative

The manager at Uhual didn‚Äôt care or apologize or even try to help find us one at a different location.  Basically the moving day I had planned far in advance was ruined.  Also, I never received communication that my reservation was changing!!!!  Extremely unprofessional to change an order with communicating to the customer then turn the customer away with no help no nothing.

The return other than at was fine except for all the pictures I have you take but I understand. But if you‚Äôre gonna have a key drop box make the opening big enough for all of your keys not just thin ones. Only other option is leave them in the car locked the doors and you haul should get a remote opening capability. And make that part of the app!

It took my husband an hour and a half to do the pick up via the app.   No one would come out and help him.   He spoke to three different customer service representatives before finally being able to get the keys to the truck.

I‚Äôm actually still on hold to talk to customer advice about this app (now a 30 min ‚Äúon hold‚Äù call and still waiting).

The truck had not been cleaned before use. The cab floor was muddy and the cab contained loose change and dirt and debris ( in the middle of a viral pandemic).  The cargo area had not been swept and there was a dustpan full of dirt, paper and some dead roaches this was unacceptable as well. Please clean and scrub the inside of this truck before another family uses it. I wore sterile latex gloves the whole time I was in it	negative

There are options for straight hair, kind of Wavy hair, and extremely curly/kinky hair. But there is not a single option for looser curls.  Afro texture is almost all there is, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing. I‚Äôm glad they have so many options for those with super curly locks! But as a curly haired woman myself, everyone (a lot of girls) I‚Äôve met with the same hair texture as me have complained about this when it‚Äôs brought up. This includes every women in my family, we have been forced to use straight hair on our bitmojjis. And my god is it annoying that not one style of hair matches our incredibly common curly hair texture.  There is (being generous) maybe one hair option in-between straight/sight wave, and 4C kinky curls. Even just adding three or four generic options at different lengths in the very middle of wavy and kinky would make SO many people happier with the app.     If there were 4 groups of hair, moving from straightest to curliest, just to illustrate. Let‚Äôs say:    Straight. Wavy. Curly. Kinky.      There would be nothing for the curly category for women except maybe one hair style. Please make more hair!!!!!!!! I‚Äôve been waiting for it for years now! And am leaving this comment after silently just hoping for an update.	positive
1651	868077558	utility	5	To be honest I really love this app but some things do bug me sometimes, I did see that you guys have different styles of Bitmojis and one of them is bitstrips. I have nothing against that style but why do they have more hair and the ability to have earrings? I hope you guys actually update the deluxe type because that would be great. I would also love it if you guys had accessories like necklaces, earrings, things like that maybe some chains you know get creative with it. Also I LOVE that we can now create our own outfits, I hope the clothing choice becomes bigger in the future but for now it‚Äôs really nice! I would love to see oversized sweaters and hoodies, more shoes and socks, high waisted sweatpants, skirts with patters, shirts with design on them, and basically just items that will make us look more fashionable and also let us express ourselves. now hats, they are really good believe me but I would love to see some bandanas in the ‚Äúbabushka style‚Äù or the new trendy look, clips, a plant cause aEsThEtIc, and some butterflies but again anything creative and fun is ok with me. That‚Äôs all I have to say but for now it‚Äôs a pretty good app keep up the great work! :)	positive
1652	868077558	utility	5	I love bitmoji and so does my best friend. We use it all the time and love the new outfit update. I would just like to make a few suggestions on stickers and outfits. First, i use the YES MA‚ÄôAM soldier bitmoji ALL THE TIME and love it, so if you guys could keep it that would be awesome. Second, I would love if you could add a hair flip bitmoji because me and my friend do so many hair flip worthy things and we always wish there was a bitmoji for it! Third, could you guys add more shoes? I know that you just added more shoes but maybe some different styles and classy ones too. (I don‚Äôt think that 3 is necessary but I was just asking) Lastly, I would like to ask that you guys could make new shirts, and maybe a plaid one. The reason why I am requesting plaid is because I wear plaid all the time and wish that I could dress my bitmoji in the clothes I love to wear. I would also like if there could be swimsuit options that we could wear with shorts and whatever because being a swimmer, I do that a lot. I also would like to add more hair styles, I‚Äôm not too picky about that but just in general. I hope you take into consideration these few things and have a great day.	positive
1653	868077558	utility	4	Bitmoji is a nice app. I think that it should let you customize your skin color, hair color, hair treatment color, and some other color stuff. I want to be able to customize my hairstyle. I also wish that you could customize the color of your makeup, clothing, and shoes. I think that chest size is another thing. They don‚Äôt have mine.... and I think that they just need more customizable things.  There should be more sweatshirt and coat options as well. They don‚Äôt have any options that I like. They should ask if you wanna customize your pants, and if you do, then they‚Äôll let you do it that. Shirt options is another thing. I don‚Äôt really like any of them. They‚Äôre way too simple, I want some more color options, and I want to be able to customize the length. I don‚Äôt want a full half top, but not a really long shirt. Or I want a VSCO shirt, a oversized top. I also want better looking shorts. I‚Äôm being picky, but it‚Äôs better then giving nothing at all. I also want more body type options. I‚Äôm going to be giving more of a review. But this is all for now. Maybe vans, the checkered, and shirts and stuff üòâ	positive
1654	868077558	utility	4	Bitmoji is an amazing app! Weather you use it for SnapChat,Texting, whatever! I enjoy how you can customize your own little you. But there is so many ways that you could make bitmoji an even more amazing app! First off more fashion! There is already lots of clothes to choose from, but try to put even more in the app more frequently and that would be fantastic! Second, you should be able to customize even more, like your height, the length of your hairstyle, and have more options for breast sizes. Thirdly, you should be able to change the color of clothing. When I go to pick a different clothing item I want and it‚Äôs bright pink or some color that I don‚Äôt want I no longer want to wear that item, there should be an option to change the color of the clothing item. Finally, please consider being able to mix and match items, like have and an option to ‚Äòmix clothing‚Äô and select the items you want to mix. Please take this into consideration it and I would give it 5 stars, it would also make the app so much more amazing! But overall I totally recommend this app over any other, it is amazing!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è	positive
1655	868077558	utility	3	I love Bitmoji and have used it for years. My only issue with it is the limited body sizes and shapes. I hoped with the deluxe upgrade you would remedy this travesty but we‚Äôre already halfway through 2019 and from the chin down your Bitmoji editor is still failing to account for the majority of the population. You have 4 super skinny options and one ‚Äúplus-size‚Äù that could be mistaken for pregnant instead. As a large framed, hourglass shaped woman I find this incredibly disheartening. There are twenty different options for noses, chins, even ears, but when you finally get to body size you get 5?!? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs more difficult to create clothing options for every size you offer, but I know I‚Äôm not alone in wishing my Bitmoji avatar reflected more of my real life curvyness. Read any women‚Äôs magazine today you‚Äôll be sure to find an article discussing how to dress for all the different body shapes. It‚Äôs time for Bitmoji to stop catering to a one size fits all market and start offering options for ALL the major body sizes. I would love to see you add options for Pear-shaped, Apple-shapes, Oval, Square, Triangle and hourglass body shapes plus different frame sizes as well. Please make this happen!!	positive
1656	868077558	utility	5	Bitmoji is such a great app. I love the new clothes, skin tones, accessories, etc. I love the new ‚Äúhair treatment‚Äù thing because so many girls have ombr√© balayage or colored hair in general. Everything is more diverse and you have many options. I have used Bitmoji for a long time now and I am obsessed. I recommend this to absolutely anyone and everyone. This is such a great app to have. Even if you don‚Äôt have Snapchat. My one suggestion is that I wish there was a section where you could create your own Bitmoji. Of course you customize your little person, but I don‚Äôt mean that. I mean, like if you can send a Bitmoji with a personalized message/pose/background. For example, for all the limelights, a Bitmoji that says ‚ÄúI said boom boom boom now lemme hear you say wayhoo!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúBoom boom boom‚Äù and a separate one that says ‚Äúwayhoo!‚Äù  Or for non limelights, a personal message that says something specific like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to see you later at the game.‚Äù Or whatever. Do you see my point? It would be nice to have a variety of Bitmojis ready and to be able to form your own.	positive
1657	868077558	utility	4	"This app is really amazing and I love to use it whenever I text, on snapchat, or just to customize it just for fun. One really big thing that bothers me is for the hair, there is no option to put highlights. I feel like most people either have dyed or natural highlights which is why you should add it to the hair section. 
           Another thing is that you should add custom eye colors instead of just putting a certain amount of eye colors. My friend for instance, she has hazel eyes and sometimes they change from light green to light brown to light blue. My eyes are light green but sometimes they change to blue. 
           Also again for the hair, there should be more hairstyles for the girls that have a side part and is wavy and curly. Whenever I‚Äôm choosing a hairstyle for myself, it just doesn‚Äôt look like my style. Also whenever the bitmoji moves their head, the hair doesn‚Äôt move with it so it would be cool if it was like real life when you move your head the hair moves with it. 
           Other than that, this app is really awesome and I love and appreciate what you guys are doing to make it better. Thank you"	positive
1658	868077558	utility	4	I think this app is good, but there still could be some improvements. First off hair. I think there should more options for people who have curly hair like me. I also think there should be more options for eye color. Some people have hazel eyes, not just one color. Another improvement could be with clothes. I think there could be something where u could customize clothes or make new clothes more often. And maybe u could have an option for people who have ear piercings. Also there could a setting where u could add jewelry or something like that. And maybe have more options for clothes. This app is really amazing, but just because something works well doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt make it better!! Other than this the app is really amazing!!! I have fun reading the funny things my Bitmoji says. If u r interested in getting this app u TOTALY should. I use this app everyday. It is so entertaining and u will find that ur bitmoji is quite the character!üòâ It is a fun app where u can customize ur character. I hope the creator of Bitmoji will consider my suggestion!!! Love this app tho!!! üòä	positive
1659	868077558	utility	3	"ok so i love this app. i use it on an almost daily basis when i‚Äôm texting my friends, and there‚Äôs a bitmoji for nearly everything. however, there‚Äôs not enough hairstyles. i always style my hair in an ariana grande ponytail but there‚Äôs no bitmoji hairstyle for that. plus, instead of dying the ends of my hair a different color i have highlights, blue highlights, but again there isn‚Äôt an option for that so my bitmoji doesn‚Äôt look like me..please fix this and i will make my rating five stars. thanks.

ps. one more thing: i really feel that having preset, prestyled outfits is boring, i‚Äôve tried so many personal avatar apps and they all have prestyled outfits so you don‚Äôt get to pick your shoes, you choker, your t shirt. if you made it so that users could like pick each individual thing on their outfit, from the scarf (if they want one) to the shoes, that would be just AMAZING. each outfit could be uniquely styled to each individual user‚Äôs preference. i know bitmoji is so much better than all those other apps and this would make it even better. thanks so much for reading this. i really hope i will be able to give bitmoji five stars in the future."	positive
1660	868077558	utility	4	"I just redownloaded the app after a year without having it and I‚Äôm loving it so far! All the new options made it so my Bitmoji looks more than just kinda like me! Buuuutttt I really need more photo options with dogs! There seem to be a lot of cats and only a couple dogs. 

If it could be developed where you could build your dog (or cat) just like you build yourself, either in this same app or in a partner app, that would be the coolest. There are no good options out there for that and I would love to be able to use my actual dog as a Bitmoji!!

Edit: After a few weeks of using Bitmoji there are a few thing that would make the customization of the avatar closer to real life. Some way to show tattoos would be great! Even if it was just basic drawings on different body parts it would get the point across. Also, being able to change clothing items individually rather than as a full outfit would be wonderful! And finally, better options for hazel eyes!! I had to go with green because nothing was quite right otherwise but my eyes are rarely just green."	positive
1661	868077558	utility	3	This app is fun to use if you enjoy making avatars of yourself but as someone who can‚Äôt make a bitmoji that actually looks like themselves I notice a lot of missing options for character customization. Things like the lack of curly hair and the barely enough set skin tone options can be bothersome if you want to make a character that looks like you. Back when bitstrips was still a thing I believe I remember the option to choose a wheelchair, which was really nice but it‚Äôs gone now in bitmoji. There‚Äôs a lot of physical features that could be added but something as big as the hair you have can be a make or break for some people‚Äôs avatars. Besides the customization features, every time I install the app, I seem to get more ads on my browsers and the bitmoji keyboard always sets itself to the default keyboard, which most of the time, causes whatever app I‚Äôm using to crash. I don‚Äôt really understand why we have to grant bitmoji full permission to use the keyboard either.  Despite all of the flaws, it‚Äôs definitely a fun app to use with friends, but it absolutely has room for improvement.	positive
1662	868077558	utility	5	"Okay, I‚Äôm going to start off by saying that I love the customizable clothes feature, but it really doesn‚Äôt have many options or brands. So maybe more options for jeans, jackets/outerwear, and especially shoes. Could you pleeese put in some tennis shoes that AREN‚ÄôT Vans or Coverse? I know that those are both pretty gender-neutral, but Nikes, Adidas, stuff like that is still good to have on hand. Also in the preset clothes options I feel like there needs to be more winter clothes, like maybe more faux fur stuff, and also definitely more brands in general, maybe Under Armour, American Eagle, Aeropostale, etc. that would be nice. And both genders for all of this stuff too. üòÅ. Another thing. Tattoos! So many people have them now, so please make that possible. 
One more thing. The ability to make multiple Bitmoji. I‚Äôm just going to leave you with that.
EDIT: I truly think there should still be a search feature for wardrobe even though there is mix and match."	positive
1663	868077558	utility	4	I just wanna state before I continue that i am talking about the options fir females & i have a few complaints. My First & biggest issue is that I strongly think you guys should add more variety to lips, the lips are awfully thin & theres people out there (like myself) who have very full lips, you should not only be able to pick the size but the shape as well (i.e cupids bow or a pout). My second complaint is that there are not many hair selections for girls with loser curls, especially on bitstrips. They go from very very loose waves to somewhat curly to kinky curls or theyre are very short cuts with no layers... There also should be an option for a part (left side, right side & center..) as well as an extension for bangs possibly. My last complaint is the mix & match, I really think you guys should add a lot more items to it (items from the pre-made outfits & such). As for clothing i think jewelry should 100% be added (hoops, pendants & crosses, bracelets, piercing & maybe even rings..). But overall i love this app a lot & new & amazing things cone out of it every time its updated ‚ô•Ô∏è	negative
1664	868077558	utility	4	I love bitmoji! It's super fun to customize your own personal bitmoji, and I find that there's an accurate bitmoji for almost any occasion/situation. Plus, the mix-and-match feauture only adds to further customization. However, I do have a few ideas for how to improve this app. Firstly, I definently think that the designers of this app should add an option for braces! So many people these days find these mini metal machines fixated on their teeth for a while, and couldn't possibly imagine their appearance without them. And it's mostly teenagers who use this app, after all, and they are usually the people who have braces. That is why I think that it's important to add a choice for braces. In addition, the designers should include a low ponytail in the hairstyle section. It's one of the most common, easy hairstyle girls these days wear. The only ponytails available right now is this super high ponytail and an awkward side ponytail. We need low ponytails, please! As you can see, I only have two PRESSING requests. Please see them through as soon as you can. Otherwise this app is great!	positive
1665	868077558	utility	4	"So, I have been with Bitmoji for a while now, and have noticed that Bitmoji has actually been updating outfits, and other accessories pretty often. Something that I am just a little on the edge about, I really sometimes cannot find the correct hairstyle and have to keep changing it until I find the right one. I‚Äôm really hoping that you‚Äôll be able to add more long hair style options, for example, like space buns, of like French braids, or a sleek bun. And maybe make the hairs look a little less glossier because whenever I choose the 2 black options, it doesn‚Äôt fit my hair color (very dark brownüòÇ) And also, coming from someone who has quite bushy eyebrows, there isn‚Äôt really an option for people with big eyebrows. And one last thing :) try more natural nude matte shades for lipsticks colors, since most of them are glossy, they look different with different skin tones. I really hope that you can help me, and probably a lot of problems that others have as well.
(Piercings would be great too)

                 Thanks!"	positive
1666	868077558	utility	4	"I love this app!! It's so fun!!! Even got my co workers hooked on it!! Love that you have scrubs now!!!!!! I haven't checked recently, but could we make it easier to use for commenting on Facebook? Like that we can use it as a status update, but being able to comment without having to like screen shot or something, and then finding the post we want to comment on would be soooo much easier. Also could we get a selection of pjs and a bigger selection for maternity, I'm not that big yet, and none of those outfits are ummm my type, and I am sure other users feel the same way. Otherwise doin an awesome job guys!! Keep up the great work!!!!

Update: with every update, I love this app even more!!! I‚Äôve gotten so many friends hooked on it!! I have used this app since bitstrips came out. More ways to customize our clothes more specifically would be great!! Also maybe some mini games within the app to play with our mini games, or maybe an extension of the app for a game?? Just suggestions, still doin a phenomenal job guys, keep it up!!!"	positive
1667	868077558	utility	4	I absolutely love using this app for texting my friends. It adds a touch of fun in group chats. There are something‚Äôs that I wish were different, however. I agree with PuppyLover147 on things that would make the app better. Mix-and-match-able wardrobe would be ideal. Some of the outfits don‚Äôt match my personal style, or one part of the outfit does, while the other does not. Accessories such has earrings on brace are not available (at least I‚Äôm pretty sure). Also, the app IS rated for 12+, however, the language used makes me cringe every time I come across one. Once again agreeing with PuppyLover147, I suggest a parental filter, or something of the sort. One last thing. I personally don‚Äôt have Snapchat. My friends do, and I want to play Bitmoji games, too. The app Game Pigeon is an app that allows you to play numerous games with your friends over text. I was thinking that you could implement some kind of Bitmoji game like that. But, besides these few things, Bitmoji is a great app that I enjoy having so greatly!	positive
1668	868077558	utility	4	I appreciate all the updates they‚Äôve made and they‚Äôve all been improvements I just wish they would put all the updates together. For example, they have some great outfits and good separates but you can‚Äôt edit the given outfits. You also can no longer search for things. I also wish they would add pattern availability. If they would catalog all the items in the separates that are in the outfits and added a search availability that would totally improve the app. If there was a pattern section maybe they could let you design your own patterns to apply to clothing items. Another thing they could have is a color slider/creater instead of the list. For the hair section you should be able to apply various bang styles to any cut or style (bangs on a ponytail instead of just straight). Ik parts of this seem excessive but some of these things they already had and were good but replaced with something else good but not the same (taking away the search feature and adding separates). Rant over ;)	positive
1669	868077558	utility	5	Bitmoji is great but you need to have more clothing few more ways to express yourself would not hurt either. On bitmoji their could be a chat room to talk to friends, but other than that bitmoji is great I use it a lot when I‚Äôm texting and for my profile pics on social media. But you could make it a bit more kid friendly I have some siblings and their to young for some of bitmojis content. Also the girl body‚Äôs are weird I know you can do better, (of course I have not seen the boy body‚Äôs but their most likely weird to). As I was saying before about more ways to express yourself, sometimes I want to use bitmoji but I can‚Äôt because you don‚Äôt have the right bitmoji for it like ( I lost ). And with coughing you really need to step up your game bitmoji when I go to put on a new clouthing it takes me forever to find something I like. But in conclusion bitmoji is not prefect but if your looking to get the app I recommend it to you and I give bitmoji five stars to show l mean it!	positive
1670	868077558	utility	5	"I have 0 complaints. I never review apps, but this one is one everyone should have. There is now something for nearly every occasion. You don‚Äôt even need an occasion to use it. You can have a complete conversation using these personalized bits/emojis without ever typing a word. From expressing anger, sadness, boredom, sarcasm, anxiety, over-worked, tired, nonchalance, attraction/flirt, toilet break (haha), waiting, long distance, and new ones added ALLLL the time. What makes this app unique in my opinion, is the detail in the face expressions. It makes them not only stand out but also more relatable. 
 The ONLY thing that I miss having access to is BitStrip... there was nothing more entertaining than being able to create a bit strip with one of your friends and having the ability to personalize it. A long while back I had seen that it was available in other country‚Äôs but not in the IS. I really wish we could access it here... because it was awesome."	negative
1671	868077558	utility	4	"This app is Amazing! I love creating a little Character and using it text all my friends and family they new Version of the bitmoji the deluxe IS SO AMAZING. . . . But one thing I would love to be added is being able to customize your clothing. . . I mean I really like all the choices I get of clothes but some of them just look weird .  . . And the limited choices kinda get boring and I somethings check in to see if the app has new clothes but nope it just the same boring stuff. . . . Adding this for a update would be great!
1) people can either choose to keep the original outfit or they can take like the top the bottoms or the shoes 
2) people can show themselves in the different ways they can in the clothes their bitmoji wears. . .
3) Some think this is a cool add on to the app and others don‚Äôt (but majority people think it‚Äôs a cool add on that you bitmoji should do)
I hope that if this add on is a update I hope you can switch all the clothes to make your own. That would make us (or some) happy just like me."	positive
1672	868077558	utility	4	So I downloaded bitmoji when I saw it on Snapchat a couple of months ago and absolutely loved it. I managed to make my bitmoji look exactly like me and when the update came out w/ the camera feature my bitmoji looks even more like me and that‚Äôs what got me hooked into using this app a lot especially in text messages. The only thing I have to complain about this app is the clothing options! I wish there was more constant updates w/ the clothing. It‚Äôs boring not having many options and we all know that clothing is the way we express ourselves and of course in many other ways but for me clothing is how I express myself. There‚Äôs too much sports related clothing and not enough of day to day clothing. I check in every week to see if there has been an update to the clothing options and every time I check I get less and less enthusiastic about bitmoji. I find myself using it less too. Eventually I‚Äôm going to stop using it all together if we don‚Äôt have enough clothing options üò© PLEASE MORE CLOTHING DON‚ÄôT LET US DOWN!!!	positive
1673	868077558	utility	1	"Before I updated Bitmoji, I had an issue with the picture not sending to one of my friends and I thought it had something to do with my wifi, so I paid money for faster wifi. I didn't send Bitmojis to that person anymore so when I tried with other friends it STILL DID NOT SEND!!! I finally figured out that it had something to do with my app, so then deleted the app, downloaded it again, made my character, and EVERYTHING was fine. When I got an alert that I can do an update I immediately did, it finished and I opened the app. Every picture was white and supposedly loading and usually it takes a minute or so to load. I thought it was loading and waited, but none of the pictures loaded. I am confused because I got faster internet. It might be because of the update or the app. It is still white and ""Loading"" right now.

{Edit} APP IS GONE! Okay, I got a new phone recently and I downloaded Bitmoji. It said it was done downloading so I go to my home screen trying to send a Bitmoji to my good friend and the app wasn‚Äôt there. LIKE WHAT... IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?!? I‚Äôm born in 1997 so it‚Äôs not the age... So what is the problem? I don‚Äôt know.. why or what, or is it a bug? That‚Äôs why I gave you 1 star..."	positive
1674	868077558	utility	4	I refused to download the app for a really long time because I thought creating an avatar would be too time consuming. It‚Äôs not! It was so easy and so fun! In fact, after the update to have the avatar look life like, every single one of my friends said that mine was the only one that they could say looks like me. I do agree with the featured review that there could be ways to adjust hair length and more styles for curly/wavy hair. I also would like to see more clothes options, or mix and match options. Some of the styles are too over the top or too simple for my liking. Some outfits I love except for one feature that I could do without and would love to eliminate it or swap it out for something else. They could be a really great feature; a ‚Äúbuild your own outfit‚Äù section ( like Cher‚Äôs closet in ‚ÄúClueless‚Äù!) Oh, and maybe change up the ‚Äúgoodnight‚Äù options, those haven‚Äôt changed in months and they are getting pretty old. Still an awesome app. Love that we can add friends to our bitmojis when sending them.	positive
1675	868077558	utility	5	Ok, I still have this at five stars because it‚Äôs not horrible. There is only a couple things I wish they would add. There is no glitches I‚Äôve seen so far, and nothing is super inappropriate or anything for younger kids...it‚Äôs just the customization of my bitmoji. First, I am a teen, so I have braces. When all my friends see my bitmoji, they are all like, ‚Äúwhere are your braces??‚Äù I keep telling them that this app doesn‚Äôt have any. I look different and for me, I‚Äôm pretty picky, but I‚Äôll live. But if you guys do add braces, don‚Äôt make them look al weird and crappy (sorry), because that would just be worse! Second, clothes. I wish there was more clothes. Everything there which was recently added...it‚Äôs just too much. Just something basic, but cute! That‚Äôs all I really have to say. It was just ideas mostly. But if you want a little mini me of yourself you should get this app! I really enjoy it and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be deleting it soon.	positive
1676	868077558	utility	4	Bitmoji is one of my favorite apps. I love almost everything about it. I wish that on bitmoji you could make your own outfits. Instead of having pre made outfits you could style whatever you want. I also think it would be cool to change the color of clothing. Sometimes I love the outfit but the color isn‚Äôt for me. I think it would be really cool if you could take a picture of yourself and it would immediately change to looking exactly like you. One setting I think would be awesome is to save creations so if you like a bitmoji you made but want to make a new one you can save it and come back to it later. One last thing I want you to add is more clothing options. You give us so many styles but I feel like you need to update. The summer styles you gave us last year are pretty good but I want you to add different outfits for more selection. If you were to make these changes I would absolutely give this app five stars. Please consider my ideas. I love this app ‚ù§Ô∏è	positive
1677	868077558	utility	2	WHERE ARE THE NEW YEAR OUTFITS!!!! The outfits have been the same so much. The new mix and match closet is cool but in my opinion released at the wrong time, right before Christmas. There should be more modern clothes and more options for body types too. Variety is key. I wish there were more hairstyles too. I love bitmoji, it‚Äôs so cute, but my primary concern is, again, the outfits. The maternity section has lots of the older, nicer outfits which bitmoji decided to remove! I really want one of the outfits in the maternity section, why is it only available there? Do I have to get pregnant to wear exclusive clothes? Please make the outfits in the maternity section available for others. I also truly miss the hollister and forever 21 outfits from 2016. I wish those would come back, in my opinion they were the nicest outfits bitmoji has ever had and now they‚Äôre removed for uglier outfits which people aren‚Äôt wearing as much. I don‚Äôt see many people wearing anything from the sporting section which you have made so much room for, nor the bitmotees section. Please consider my opinions to improve this app and make everyone happier :)	positive
1678	868077558	utility	4	"This app is great! I prefer using my Bitmoji over GIFs. My only issue is that I, as a FTM transgender person, do not like using the male avatar because the face and body shapes do not fit my pre-transitioned face and body shape, but the female avatar does not have the ""male"" outfit choices that I would like. This could go both ways. Gender is not tied to expression. Men should have the choice to wear crop tops and tights in their right body shape and women should be able to wear muscle tanks and cargo shorts in their right body shape if wanted.

It would be outstanding if, like the hair section, there were no gender tied to the options provided. It would be great if all of the options provided to men were provided to women and vice versa. It would be beyond great if there were no need to choose in the beginning which binary gender you are, as not everyone considers themself male or female and that shouldn't determine the options you are provided.

Please take this into consideration. Otherwise, I love this app! I'm just having dysphoric dilemmas."	positive

It never crashes, and it‚Äôs never slow and NEVER lags, but I just think the selection of STUFF to edit your avatar in general should be bigger...Especially the hair selection. I still can‚Äôt find a style just right for my hair, which is wavy and thick with a natural side part but it doesn‚Äôt BULGE out or anything. And also the outfits. Although only Boo! (Which I deleted because it completely doesn‚Äôt work anymore) had this feature, I just think being able to customize and mix and match different pieces of an outfit would be awesome. Also one more thing...eye colour. My eyes are brown but a light shade that most of the time leans more toward amber, but the only brown eyes that are offered are really dark. Maybe you could have some sort of bar that can adjust the lightness and darkness of each eye colour, like Boo! used to have. Also there‚Äôs no hazel eyes! Thanks for a great app anyway! I use it all the time!!üôÇüôÉüôÇüôÉ	positive

You now get to add highlights to your hair and I read that they include over 100+ hairstyles. Your clothes stay the same! They always come up with NEW cute stickers almost every single day, featuring some emojis. 
 You get to link this app to various types of chatting apps, such as, Messages, Snapchat, Instagram, etc. If you link Bitmoji to Snapchat you get Friendmoji which features your friends in your stickers. Many cute stickers and all of them feature YOU in the spotlight! I give this app 5 stars because this is all FREE! No lie! 
 Although, I would like to make just one suggestion, they should add a new clothing line so we have more outfits to express our Bitmoji. 

Thank you for reading this review, hope this helps you out! I highly recommend Bitmoji, so hope this guides you!"	positive
1681	868077558	utility	5	"I LOVE this app and like many others I have a bit of an addiction to it. I love this new style!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è But, I do think there could be some more things that could be added to make this app be even better. 
1. For the female avatars I personally think there should be a wider verity in long hair styles. I was scrolling though and many of these styles were short and seemed more appropriate for the male avatars. 
2. The clothing in the app hasn‚Äôt changed much which is kind of sad seeing that the new year is here and many fashion trends are on the rise. I think what would make it better would be if you could swipe though all the tops,pants, dresses, shoes, etc, and make your own outfit. Many people like to wear many different things, this would improve the app in many ways. 
I do truly love this app. I just think that some improvements could be made to make it even better!! I hope you all agree!"	positive
1682	868077558	utility	5	I love Bitmoji. My friends and I use it all the time. But with certain hairstyles, and when you wear hats, your hair still sticks out so it looks weird. I think that maybe you could actually make it look like the bitmoji is wearing an actual hat. It‚Äôs the same thing with straight and long hair. It‚Äôs all sticking out and it looks really weird. But other then everything is AMAZING. But with the Halloween costumes, I think there should be more costume selections. Such as a mummy, bat, wizard, Frankenstein, or even horror movie characters such a Michael Myers, Freddy Kruger, Jason Vorhees, the Ghost Face from scream, a Ghost, e.t.c. Also we need more clothes. Like for instance, when I get dressed in the morning, I pick out pants and a shirt and shoes to go with what I‚Äôm wearing. But in Bitmoji you can‚Äôt to that. I would love to see that happen though. But I LOVE bitmoji and I would love to see more improvements. It is a great app. I think everyone should get it. Thanks for reading	positive
1683	868077558	utility	1	I have been using the app for about 2 years now and I was loving it. But now I find that they have taken the Superhero styles away. My Avatar was dressed as Wonder Woman this whole entire time until today, when I changed her clothes to a baseball uniform for a point I was making in a text to family members. When I went to change her clothes back to Wonder Woman, I discovered that I was not able to because the Superhero section is no longer there. For the most part the app is really pretty good and a fun way to express oneself, which I do frequently with this app.  But I am very disappointed that the Superhero section has been taken out along with other fun movie sections like Game Of Thrones and X Files. It seems that the clothing sections that were the most fun are the ones that have been taken out. Now I am left with either sports or boring attire for my Avatar to wear. Just to give you an idea of the type of character I am: I a 60 year old woman who owns lots of crazy sox because they are an extension of my personality, loves Wonder Woman, gaming, adventure, and I sport intense lilac color hair. Please bring back the Superhero clothing. PLEASE BRING BACK WONDER WOMAN!!	positive

This is a BASIC feature and it‚Äôs irritating that it hasn‚Äôt been added after at this time.  I do a lot of conversing via text and I don‚Äôt have time to sit around and swap to the Bitmoji keyboard and search for a keyword (since we don‚Äôt know what each bitmoji is called), go back and paste it in. It severely limits my use of the app, which is a shame because I really do love it!

Previous review:  I really like this app and the keyboard that you can use while text messaging. But, they really need to add a ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù tab to the keyboard where you can favorite the bitmojis that you love so it‚Äôs quicker to find then when texting. In a conversation that moves along at a good pace, you don‚Äôt always have time to scroll through the myriad of options looking for that one elusive bitmoji.  So, developers please consider adding this simple feature."	positive
1685	868077558	utility	5	May I just start by saying this app is awesome. It has great qualities and is so customizable it is insane how much time it must have taken to build it. But I do have a few ideas. To start, I feel like having a few more hairstyles and lengths would be amazing, like really long hair or pigtails. Also, if there was a option for jeans to rip like the shirt tucking toggle, that would be very helpful. Another idea is that if you could give the option of streaks for your hair, like the hair treatment choice, it would really be great. Next, if you could add more outer wear like cropped sweatshirts that would also be awesome. Finally, if you could add a kid/teen/adult option that would be great. I mean, sure you can change the build of the character and the wrinkles, but that doesn‚Äôt do that much for height. So yeah, it is an incredible app, but there are a few things that could make it even better.	positive
1686	868077558	utility	4	I really like bitmoji a lot, and use it every day. The new update was great because it offered a lot more ways to customize your bitmoji in terms of body size, hairstyles, and a lot of other things. However, I think it would be fantastic if there were way more options for hairstyles, as my hair isn't that unique or uncommon but I can't find anything that looks like it. I also think that there should be more fun options for people with straight or wavy hair, like the two buns style there is for curly hair. Also, I think being able to customize outfits by mix and matching shirts, pants, and shoes would be a huge improvement as the outfit choices are kind of lacking. Another great addition would be to add an accessories option for jewelry, earrings, purses, etc as it would again allow for more customization and make the bitmoji look more like the real person. I hope the app keeps improving at the rate it is now because it's really fantastic!	positive
1687	868077558	utility	3	I believe bitmoji is good for customizing your Snapchat or keyboard and making it seem more like you but there isn‚Äôt much diversity. What I mean by that is like body and hair diversity. One of the few things that irk me about making a bitmoji is the fact that they are almost all skinny and the curviest one is made to look like a potato. Me and many other women believe that there should be customizable body parts, like the option to remove a thigh gap, get breasts that are as big as ours in real life and even adjust our waist size. That way our bitmoji can *really* look like us. Rather than having the same old boring skinny body that doesn‚Äôt even look like us. And for hair there isn‚Äôt much to complain about, there‚Äôs almost every style... for straight/wavy hair. For curls there needs to be a few more styles for women like me who don‚Äôt wear their curls in a ugly updo or down all the time because in all honesty no girl with curls wears it down all the time. That‚Äôs all I find wrong with this app, I‚Äôm looking forward to any updates :)	positive
1688	868077558	utility	4	"Ok, so you have an amazing app here, I use it on a regular basis as does everyone in my family to the point we have whole conversations without using a regular keyboard, but the hair... my biggest issue is lack of hair choices for just below the shoulder hair. 

I have shoulder length hair that is just past my shoulders and no only are their few actually cute options for this style, there are few styles in general for this length. There are tons for long hair and you‚Äôve even reached the shaved heads... where are the cute styles for those of us with average length hair? I have wavy side part just past my shoulders. Where is that style? You have a lot of cute styles for very long hair...but some of us can‚Äôt grow our hair that long... just because it‚Äôs not down our backs doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt deserve options and cute styles too. I‚Äôm just sayin.

Clothes that could be mixed and matched would be awesome. Most of the outfits are cute enough butttttt not really a thing I would wear...ever."	positive
1689	868077558	utility	5	I love the app 10/10 quality. But I do think they should make an update with more outfits, colors, and personnel outfits. I think they should make it so that you can design your own outfit. It could have a selection of tops with different colors. A selection of dresses all different shapes and sizes. And skirts, pants, jumpsuits, and more. But you could change the style and color of them all. It would be a great update. Also if they could add strapless things I think a lot of people would like that. And if you could either choose solid colors or patterns for the design that would be so fun and amazing. Plus then it can help them look more like you by having more unique options. I would also like a selection of sport bras and shorts. Also more sports things like let‚Äôs say your a gymnast a leotard would be good. I also think that different shoes would be good. But overall a very good app, love it.	positive
1690	868077558	utility	4	I really love Bitmoji. It‚Äôs fun to be able to customize a cartoon character that looks like me. But I wish there was more options for hair, freckles, and body size. I think your Bitmoji should be more customizable. I have a lot of freckles and the app really only has the option to put a few on your face. I also think the hair section of the app should have a feature were you can customize length, waviness, and wether or not you have bangs. Also there are only like 5 different body shapes. I feel as if there should be more. The last thing I want to suggest would be the best change in my opinion. I think people should be able to customize clothes. You could pick a plain  item of clothing and then you could pick out patterns and colors and things like that. If that isn‚Äôt possible I still think the app should have more clothes. All in all this is a great app. If you read this I really suggest downloading it. üíú	positive
1691	868077558	utility	4	"I've really enjoyed this app so far, but like a few other folks in the comments, I have some suggestions. There are a lot of neat outfits, but I wish there was a way to completely customize for my character. Like some other folks, I am a gay female and tend to wear more masculine-style clothes, but the options in app are a little limited in terms of me expressing myself. If you included the ability to have the entire Bitmoji wardrobe available for all genders, that would be really cool! If you added a clothing customization feature, that'd also be really cool!
Hoping to see it, but I would not be crushed if it wasn't added. Thanks for making such a fun app!

*UPDATE*
I really like that there are a ton more options for clothes, however, I‚Äôd love to see options for various sports (for example: cycling gear, or a soccer uniform, things like that). If you made those kind of outfits available, that would be amazing!!!"	positive

I don‚Äôt know if this is the same for everyone or just me, but whenever I open my phone and go to my Bitmoji keyboard, it starts to glitch from my regular iPhone keyboard and my Bitmoji keyboard, until eventually it just completely glitches out. I try to go back but it‚Äôll glitch again, bringing me to my regular keyboard yet again. I have to close the app I was trying to get it on, go into Bitmoji and see if that‚Äôll refresh, and then I can use it. I‚Äôve even made sure that it‚Äôs updated to the latest version (which it always is). It‚Äôs just really annoying and inconvenient and I hope you can look into it. 
Thank you, Bitmoji. I love the app so so much, but that one thing is just preventing that five star rating. Sorry, but the glitches need to be fixed. Thank you!"	positive
1693	868077558	utility	5	I use Bitmoji practically everyday. It is so funny, and fun. I have a few suggestions. This would make it even better. Maybe more hair colors, lengths, and styles. Also, a bit more casual, but cute clothes. I would like to have something casual, but not like nerdy, but not like crazy. Maybe also a way that we can match tops and bottoms, and change their color. That way my friend and I aren‚Äôt all matching. I think a way to add things like braces would be good, that way it is more accurate. Bitmoji has awesome pictures already, though I think maybe a way to add your own text, or have moving images would be so awesome. Bitmoji is awesome. I would love to add these, but it is awesome already. You can communicate with your friends and express your emotions. It is amazing. I use it daily, and my friends always compliment our bitmojis, and change them often. Bitmoji is amazing!!!!! ü§©üëè	positive
1694	868077558	utility	4	First of all, I would like to say that this is a really fun app, especially for texting and Snapchat. Sadly, there are some things that need to be fixed. For example, the app needs more hairstyles! Finding the right hairstyle for me was the hardest part. I have medium length wavy hair, but the only wavy hairstyles were either too short or too long. Also, other hairstyles, such as pigtails or French braids, would make the app so much better! I also think you should add more hair colors and eye colors. I have dark red hair, but all of the red hair colors were either to pink or to orange, so I had to settle with brown. You should also add hazel eyes. Not everyone has just plain blue, brown, or green eyes you know. With these tweaks, Bitmojis would be so much more customizable! Again, this is a really cool app and makes texting so much more fun. I hope this review was helpful to you and you will take my suggestions into consideration. Thank you!	positive
1695	868077558	utility	5	I love bitmoji. It make me feel more like me. I use it to express myself. I use it when I‚Äôm texting my friends. The thing that bothers me the most, is that you have to change it on a website now. I have privacy restrictions put on my phone so I‚Äôm not allowed to get in it and choose what I want. That is the thing that bothers me the most. Also I thing they should have a little more accessories like the checkered vans and maybe hooded sweatshirts. Another thing is, it should have less inappropriate things for kids that are under age for this app but still use it. These are just a few things that should be upgraded in the next update. Thank you for being so kind to read my review of bitmoji. Other than the things that need fixed, I really love this app. Thank you so much for making it. You guys kind of saved my life from being a weirdo. Lol.	positive
1696	868077558	utility	4	"I love this app. Creating your own little you is exciting and really fun! ü•∞ I just wish you could add a little bit more. Like, for example, the body sizes? The majority of those are skinny people. If you are bigger than those skinny bodies, shouldn‚Äôt you be able to pick one that fits you? There is a big body size, but it honestly looks more like someone who is pregnant ü§∞ üòÇ.

1697	868077558	utility	5	"I LOVE the bitmojis, they are so fun and easy to use, even my mom loves to use them. But - I have 3 reasons for only giving 3 stars: 
1. I can only view a very limited amount of bitmojis from the keyboard tool on the iPhone, if I want one that isn‚Äôt shown I have to search for it instead of looking it up by emotion like you can do on Snapchat (why is this different?) it would be more convenient and easily accessible if it was set up similar to Snapchat. 
2. It would be amazing to have the friend bitmojis on the iPhone keyboard when texting with a fellow contact who also has an iPhone (like you can do on Snapchat). However without being able to search for them by emotion, I don‚Äôt think it would be very user friendly.

It‚Äôs really cool because you have this avatar that you can personalize and then make it look exactly like you... almost. You did really well with all of the new features added in the recent update, but I have a few questions: 
1) Why did you take some options away? I had a Bitmoji that I really liked and when I updated it, I was forced to change it. I thought that maybe it just reset and I would have to recreate my original, but I couldn‚Äôt do it because some of the things I used were taken out of the app. 
2) Can you please add more skin tones? The one my avatar has now is many shades too light, but the next closest option is much too dark. Please fix this as I feel that it is exclusive to people who have other skin tones than the ones you offer. It forces you to pick one that doesn‚Äôt adequately represent your own."	positive

Edit: I unlinked it from my Snapchat and deleted then re installed and I had Bitmoji Deluxe. I‚Äôm glad it worked but it‚Äôs annoying I didn‚Äôt get them with the update so please fix this so I get everything with the update not a partial update. Thank you. 

Also, may you PLEASE add something where instead of going through the outfits trying to find a good one, make it so you can pick a shirt and pants / skirt  and shoes separately and pick a color for them. And please add a bigger variety when you do this, so like different skirt styles or jean styles then a color wheel to customize yourself. I do like the shoe variety I just wish you could pick style / color yourself for an outfit."	positive

I have one package on this account and my statement is almost 5 pages long in charges and credits all of which I have no clue exactly what for.  Everytime I look at my balance owed it is NEVER right!  This month it said I owed over 500$! Granted I did miss Marches payment because I couldn't get through to an operator because THAT bill was incorrect too.  March I owed 54$ but my bill said 94$.  April I owed 189$. Add those two up and it's $243 not $500!  Of course everytime you call At&t you are on the phone with them for a MINIMUM of 1.5 hours but I did and 2 hours later they ended up giving me the credits to make it right. 
Then when I go to pay on the app it says my balance due is $223 not $243... I'm not complaining in paying less but now I have to worry about my next bill being off because THEY CANT GET IT RIGHT! 
Oh and not to mention the app said I owed $223 right? But after I put my debit card info in and hit submit a window pops up and says that $223 payment does not meet my past due amount and I should reconsider the amount to pay off the balance.

When I called the representative said it was due to taxes but I told her that can‚Äôt be if I‚Äôm in a contract for set price . She looked at it closer and agrees that the bill is increasing and she will give me a $25 credit. I said no,please cancel my plan. She said she couldn‚Äôt because I was in contract.

I think you do not have a recorded line or you would check it to prove they lied to me just to get me off the phone and shows your poor almost non existent service !  You are losing customers right and left and you don‚Äôt seem to care.  No wonder your business is doing so poorly.

Fortunately I live close to an ATT store which is like the main hub in my area. I use the 661 number for easy questions but I have gone to the store to purchase new phones or change anything about the services.
I have found every single person to be polite and considerate. They are also patient in explaining anything to me that I question. I am not a ‚Äútechy‚Äù person, as I was middle aged when computers came out and as everyone knows, the technology has expanded exponentially. I am happy that I can use an IPhone and operate my computer.
The last time I was in there the lady went over my entire bill in minutiae and wrote it down on paper for me. She was able to find savings for me which I appreciated of course. I did not require new services at this time because we are waiting for service that will replace the satellite which I am not fond of. 
This is why I stay with ATT. The people, the service, and the outstanding quality of the products."	positive

Even though I haven‚Äôt explored all it‚Äôs uses I think you can do about anything you need to do with the phones, TV, and internet.  If there is something gone wrong with your account, the loyalty department can usually fix it. Even though you might have two go through two different representatives to get something done. My only complaint is recently having two different reps say they will call you back within so many hours and never call back. Also have had two different reps to tell me there are no notes on my file they can read that I told them about on the previous call, then to call a different loyalty rep and they can read them fine and stood by them and corrected my account as previously promised. But over the years ATT has ALWAYS corrected all problems that have occurred. The service reps that come to the house are the best of any I have ever used. I am very pleased to part of the ATT family and they always let you know how much they appreciate your loyalty.

The service is bad - calls just drop for no reason, calls sometimes just don‚Äôt show up but end up in voicemails. There is hardly 1 bar at my workplace when I can see the AT&T corporate office from my window (even people working there may not have proper service)
The support is terrible - call their support about anything, you will speak to 5 CSRs in an hour and the 6th one will ask you the reason for your call. So, obviously you being frustrated give up and they consider that the case is resolved. I had to argue several times and just give up when I wanted to combine my wireless and Uverse so I can get a discount they promised. These two departments operate completely separate (pretending as if they are from two different planets) and kept transferring me between the CSRs for 3 hours straight. 
Finally their app is the most terrible thing I have on my iPhone. I wish I could share screenshots or screen recordings of the app not responding at all. I keep forgetting the app is a waste and still fall for it, open to pay bill and realize my mistake and end up using PC to pay bill anyway. I‚Äôm switching the network, disconnecting home internet as well and soon and my problems are over."	negative

Then they had a tower in such disrepair I‚Äôm having no service most of the time unless I‚Äôm in a bigger city. I have to say it‚Äôs been the worse service I‚Äôve ever had, and they don‚Äôt give a crap if you really have coverage. I have been having it out with them for months and months to the point I‚Äôm paying everything off just to change service because they won‚Äôt do anything to help. They ran a technical solution test on September 11, 2019 it‚Äôs November 2, 2019 without anything back. I have requested discounts or credits for all the times without services like most companies would do yet I just get a sorry and I‚Äôll summit a work order. Then for like 45 minutes they just try to do everything but submit the work request. They will take my 235 a month without any problems yet I will get my coverage only by going down the road. I guess if your map says its has coverage it must be true. You try telling that to everyone that comes to my house that can‚Äôt get a signal either. I don‚Äôt even know why I bothered typing this long message because no one will really care, but hopefully it says someone the headaches of getting Att.	positive

If you‚Äôre getting this app it‚Äôs probably too late for you because you‚Äôre already sucked into a contract. If you do take anything out of my rant please just be advised‚Äîwatch your bill. Look at it reeeeally closely. Call, wait the ten minutes for someone to answer, tell them email their supervisor and make a note on your account if you don‚Äôt get a resolution.

As of the last three years we had so many issues and out bill kept going up. We had three lines unlimited $99ea and chargers that somehow our bill was over or about $400ea month. They supposedly fixed it and we found out they changed us from buying our phones to leasing them. We called in and told them about our friends that had AT&T with more lines than us with unlimited lines and they offered a $10 each month but I would have to call in for that discount each time. That was the straw... we have since changed over and our bill is consistent, we own our phones, and the service is stellar amazing compared to the service we had with sprint. We are not herded ok like cattle when we enter AT&T and the customer service has been amazing! Our bill went town tremendously and we are getting amazing reception on our phones.

I enjoyed AT&T because of the price but with the poor service I may have to consider going to Verizon for better service. I don‚Äôt know what you guys can say or tell me that will give me confidence that my reception in this area can be improved. Near the area in my job I‚Äôve dropped calls frequently it‚Äôs like a black hole in his in an area where I have business. I been a loyal customer with AT&T but as soon as I paid for it off I will strongly consider leaving AT&T.

1720	309172177	utility	4	I used to like this app for its user-friendliness and easy maneuverability to pay for and monitor my ATT wireless account. However, when a store branch tried selling me DirectTV and setting up an unauthorized account in my name and then unifying it with my wireless account this app had become useless. I had paid through the app a couple of times to ensure prompt monthly payments but due to the mess that DirectTV account had made those payments are stuck in ATT limbo out there for a while now. No ATT representative could help me out and I have spoken to about ten of them or even more. No one, not me, not the ATT reps, not this app can figure out what‚Äôs going on. Now, my original wireless account that had been held in good standing for so many years had suddenly been cancelled along with the unified account. I have a new account that the last ATT rep I spoke to wasn‚Äôt even too sure about. I would have rated this app better if not for the bad service I have recently been given.

Happy and excited to surprise my husband the next morning. I woke up early the next morning just to check the arrival time and found out that it is still processing. I remember paying the taxes and accepting the terms and condition too so i quickly made a call to a few att numbers that was given to me. I end up being transferred from one person to another and spend almost 2 hours on the phone and repeating my name, phone number, address, passcode to every single customer service rep. After all that trouble and by the end if the day i did not get the ipad, cancelled my order and made a new order with another rep( that was what they advised me to do to). There goes my birthday surprise! Totally disappointed with att! I currently have 8 lines plus a new ipad with my family.I just feel like cancelling everything and going to another company.

I had reported on my own accord to the customer service representative and the fraud department that a breach has occurred and you have shipped the phone which I have not ordered. The fraud team did not ask any details of who had ordered it and is there any information that I have. During one of the calls the fraud team was able to directly talk to the fraudster. The fraudster had contacted me from an ATT 1800 number and fraudster had also provided me a shipping label with a name and shipping address to ship the ordered phones. ATT was and is totally irresponsible in handling this case. Now I have received a 548$ bill. This is total lack of service and lack of protection to my account. Though repeated attempts were made by me to report this fraud, ATT never showed any interest in finding the fraudster or addressing this issue to me, but have promptly send me a bill. This lacks total lack of professionalism. I think inaction by ATT it will pave way to more frauds on the innocent coustomers. I had requested in all my calls to send me a transcript or report on this regard but no action has taken place so far. Irresponsible corporate company with no regard in addressing the fraud.	negative

1724	309172177	utility	2	It all started way back when ATT got the iphone first when I was with Verizon. That questionable decision I made to change to ATT to get the iphone has lead to a frustrating relationship with this company that seems to make everything connected with it more complicated than it needs to be or below par. This app follows that pattern. When I purchased Direct TV with Att internet bundled in i had to drop the internet as too slow because ‚Äú yeah we said the lightening quick optic cables we advertised were the fastest but we dont have those in your area. Several years later still dont. My daughters iphone never worked at all in Chicagos Lincoln Park she got 1 bar until i switched her to Verizon which solved the problem. I know . When Verizon got the iphone i should have switched back with my daughter but ATT was telling me i had unlimited data on my account and they no longer offered that to new accounts. That of course is not the case. One star because no stars is not an option. 1 star for me for putting up with this app, this overcharged service and this company. I hope i read this review and make the change. I have not seen an attempt to improve the company. Just strong sales dept not a strong product.	positive

I called to see if it could be removed since it was only one day late because my bank (through which I pay all my bills) rolled out a new app that lost my payment. The Rep I talked to kept saying it was a 'valid' charge repeatedly. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, she said the supervisor was busy. I said I'd wait for him/her. The agent said the supervisor would give me the same answer. The agent then said she couldn't do anything about the late charge because I had already paid it. This was a blatant lie since my new invoice with the late charge had just arrived and the previous bill did not have the late charge on it. Eventually she said a supervisor would call me, but no one ever did. And I was not surprised in the least. Later in the day I talked to a technical agent about my internet speed and he quickly and cheerfully resolved the issue. Later in the day I also spoke with an agent (not through the published AT&T support number) and she found a solution to my satisfaction. I would give her and the technical agent 5 stars and the original agent 0 stars.	positive

Everything, and I mean everything is just clicks away from helping you quickly with completing your task on this app. Not only can you make a few clicks, and your bill is paid, stopped its service or making a payment arrangement, but you can now, order a new/refurbished or used phone that fits comfortably into your already set plan on your account. You never have to speak with a rep. But always have the option to click on the (waiting at your service) online rep. in case you ever have questions or need guidance (which by the way, is always double checked security by the rep). I had my new upgraded Phn the next day, all according to my act plan and never had to talk to a rep once. I did call to c confirm my order though.

Your training of these customer service needs ‚Äúcompassionate and understanding representatives, also like her we were given the mistreatment and we cannot see what the plan or program that the c/s rep is typing in.

When I attempted to push the send prompt it did nothing. After deleting the app. then reinstalling several times it did the same thing. I spent about 2 hours during several calls to straighten this out without success. Customer service shows no record of a letter being sent or any block on my account. Unless the scammers are getting more sophisticated, got a hold of the AT&T wireless mailing list and are sending out fake letters then AT&T has some unresolved issues. As of this morning I am having the same issue. Can‚Äôt order a new phone, can‚Äôt pay my bill, can‚Äôt check my minutes or any other in-app. application. Anyway, I am on a family plan.

I was fine at Verizon shoulda stuck with them. Anyway the conman that sold us the phones said we‚Äôd have to pay for them for the first couple of months then the payments would fall off. Cool, that didn‚Äôt happen. I was working two jobs and didn‚Äôt have time to stay on hold for hours at a time. So my wife finally gets around to it. She calls they tell her we need to go to an AT&T store we do we sort it out they say they‚Äôre going to credit us with a 435$ credit (not nearly what enough to cover what we‚Äôve been paying for the phones but hey I‚Äôll take it.) They credit my wife‚Äôs account but not mine. And now that this covid pandemic is happening  and I‚Äôve lost one of my incomes these chicken hawks are still charging me in full.

1732	309172177	utility	1	The app is actually pretty VO accessible, which seems like they must have a policy in accordance with the law. However, be aprised before choosing AT&T or paying for insurance on a phone, that   the insurance  they try to sell you is *not* accessible. You need to be able to print out and complete a form to submit and replace your phone. This was my daughter's phone and she is in another state, and she is sighted and tried completing the form but they would not accept it as the account is in my name. I could not authorize her on the account as their only option was to send her a text message and she could not receive a text message since her phone was broken, hence the attempt to collect the insurance.  After many circular routes on their web site trying to straighten this out, I was not able to make contact with the insurance at all, AT&T was not interested in seeing this was taken care of and their operators repeatedly said illegal and offensive things to me. As my daughter was alone, with a high risk pregnancy and a hurricane approaching, I paid off the phone, close the account, and ported the phone to another carrier in order to get her a phone ASAP. No compensation for the insurance I paid for which was illegally unavailable to me was made.	negative

Very disappointed in AT&T for lack of communication on the change- you send a text when I go over my data so why wouldn‚Äôt you have shared the plan change via text? My explanation, because you wanted everyone that didn‚Äôt call to reclaim their plan to pay the additional $10 per month. Regardless, extremely irritated at the CS Rep for the poor choice of words, after I repeatedly told her I look the amount every month. If there‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve changed, I comb through the bill to make sure all is well. Guess I need to brush up on other carriers customer service? I feel the CS rep has force by hand into that conversation. I am fine with the $10 increase but not fine with a crappy remark to ‚Äúlook at my bills for updates.‚Äù BIGGEST TAKEAWAY: This answer did NOT solve the issue I was calling about.	negative

I bought and used my own international calling card‚Äî a  practice that I have adopted years ago, but for some reason twice in this year , AT&T charged me international calls of over $40 on each occasion for a single international call on those occasions. By the time my monthly bill was included, I was charged over $300 each for cell phone bills in January and March this year. I called they removed the extra charge in January after I was on the phone for one hour and being transferred to about four departments . In March they refused to remove the charges even after I spoke with the supervisor Nancy Calhoun NC 6351. She was sooo RUDE, unprofessional, talking over me loudly and playing smart being sarcastic and condescending . Also I need to mention that I have been a loyal AT&T customer of over a decade! It does not make sense for me to use AT&T for international call of $3/minute when I bought calling card that I use for 9 cents/ minute. I‚Äôve tried to contact them back to disconnect the services but the line got disconnected while still talking to them and they did not bother to call me back! So frustrating!!	negative

This needs to be fixed.
Secondly, it‚Äôs impossible to get assistance through the ‚Äúsupport‚Äù that‚Äôs shown with the app description. All I wanted to do was contact support online about the iPad app, but it was a futile effort. One should have the reasonable expectation of informing AT&T that there‚Äôs a problem with the app through email or some other means. That option does not appear to be offered. It should be easy enough to make that happen so I don‚Äôt have to give a 1 star review to receive ‚Äúsupport.‚Äù
As far as AT&T goes the actual service is below average for the costs incurred by my household. For example, we have DSL because AT&T doesn‚Äôt offer their better service to my area; however, they charge substantially more for their inferior service. It‚Äôs absurd. One can call long distance from their cellphone, but one must pay substantially more to dial long distance from a landline. Will AT&T offer any solutions here? Stay tuned..."	negative

Secondly, this mistake came about spending days in an Att store attempting to get my daughters phone in her name, as she is a senior in college and trying to create good budgeting and credit practice.
I spent three days in store attempting this with same person. He assured me it was all set. Of course next billing cycle, I receive two bills with two separate acct # in my name. Doesn‚Äôt help my daughter one bit and has made it so I can only pay one on app and one through mail.
Of course returning to Att store, they told me there is no way to change it now!!!! So I told them I‚Äôm changing carriers only to be told I had to wait two months for my daughters to be unlocked as I paid off her phone when I started process. Ironically my husband was Att employee for 10+ years until they surplused thousands. We had service with the 10+ years.
Cannot wait to change provider. Maybe surplus due to loss of money at incompetent level in retail stores, when same employee kept telling me I had to live with the mistakes he made. At same time telling me he was previously fired from Citibank. Hmmmm wonder why."	negative
1737	309172177	utility	1	AT&T is the absolute worst phone carrier on the planet. They‚Äôre customer service gets a rating of zero from me. I‚Äôve been sitting at AT&T for 2.5 hours. I‚Äôve called in over 6 times over the past month and every time I was on the phone for 1 to 1.5 hours. I‚Äôve been on hold for 1.5 hours and the employee here at AT&T was on hold for an hour before the manager on the phone told him I have to call in myself. I‚Äôve been sitting her so long that the employees‚Äô shift that was helping me is over. Now I‚Äôm dealing with someone else at the store. AT&T accidentally added 4 international plans to my account costing me over $1,000 in a single month. Its absurd that I would have to go through all of this over a mistake made by AT&T. I‚Äôm a disabled veteran and having to sit here for 2.5 hours is hurting my back and is mentally exhausting. This has been on going since December 5th and AT&T still can figure it out even though every person I spoke to on the phone says it‚Äôs a mistake made by AT&T. I have 8 phone lines, internet, and cable that I will be switching over to T-Mobile or Verizon. I will never do business with AT&T again. If AT&T is capable of doing this to a customer that‚Äôs been loyal to them for over 10 years they will do it to everyone.	negative

If you want any decent channels at all - there are additional charges. They promised me a $300 gift card - when I went to the site to get it, I got the run around and was then told the offer had expired. Then they came with trucks and ripped our yards and roads up to install new cables and left with very shoddy clean up. Since then my internet has been down. Almost four months now. I have tried many times to get service - each time they insist on going through all the diagnostics over the phone or chat lines which takes forever- still with no connection. At that time they will direct you back to the website to request a service call. It is either down or not functioning properly. When you call them - all the operators are busy - I have held for more than thirty minutes!  I cannot get anywhere with this service. My last attempt was today - after going through all the steps mentioned above - again- I disabled my payment information and will see if non payment will get them moving. Its my only option at this point. DO. NOT SWITCH!!!	positive

As a matter of fact, I‚Äôve never used another Service carrier for my cell phone and since I am the primary account holder, that means neither has anybody else in my family. I used to believe AT&T was the better option for my kinfolk and me, which is why I currently have nine phone lines, as well as a U-verse account.  These past few months are making me think otherwise. Reception, dropped calls, pricing and sale tactics have been a real turn off, but the past two weeks I‚Äôve had have tipped and the scales. I‚Äôve spent hours on the phone only to still have the runaround and no solid answer as to why my cable was held hostage-meanwhile all my data completed in a matter of a few days and AT&T adding $15 every couple of days. NICE! Never got the call I was told I didn‚Äôt get after I did your bloody survey. Meanwhile...more $15 charges with notifications to EVERYONE, even when I‚Äôve requested this to stop. I still don‚Äôt know when my internet was cut off and/or why....yet the charges still keep coming.  The first chance I get to jump, I will.

I purchased it on May 10 and returned it on May 21 and was hassled by the manager Chris. He gave me a really hard time after 2 hours of being there he finally took the phone back and told me I would be getting the credit  back however when my bill came this month it showed on my bill that it was never processed and when I called a rep of AT&T they told me it was never processed and I was still being charge. I have all the paper work to prove it but the manager has not called me back. He was very rude when I purchased it and when I returned it he he was very rude. The person that waited on me had to keep asking Chris ( the manager) how to do some things. His name is Johnathan. Please help me resolve this. I was on the phone with a AT&T rep for 1 and a half hour trying to resolve this but he couldn‚Äôt because he said it was never processed  if I could I would cancel my AT&T.

Hours upon hours I have spent dealing with the agents, some of whom don't understand English or how to pron√∫nciate words, others who simply want me transferred down the line cuz they don't wanna deal with it.  I've been lied to, promised the bill won't be any higher, it's always more than it should be.

I don't know why I haven't switched yet, but it's time.  Upcharges all over, access fees, activation fees, cancellation fees, administrative fees, government fees.  You advertise that you no longer have contracts, so I want out of this one free of charge.

Sometimes, if I am lucky, I can log in on one a particular phone. But the login NEVER works on my other phone or my laptop!  Today, I cannot get into my account on any of my devices. The worst thing is that these new customer support lines are now rerouted to a call center outside of the USA. The reps are nice enough, but they are not yet up to speed to really help. Moreover, they don‚Äôt even have access to basic account information to assist in clarifying any issues that you need help with. I work overseas with a fast internet connection connected through satellite with the USA. And, I shouldn‚Äôt be struggling like this.

1768	1200318119	utility	1	First off, the app didn‚Äôt do what I needed it to. Second off and more importantly, they enrolled me in an auto renewal $5/week premium package. Who would pay 5/wk for this crappy app. I deleted the app same day of course but found out a month later I had been charged $20+ over that time. Apple thankfully refunded me but I‚Äôm disappointed in this apps ethics. Apple should also have a function when deleting an app that has an active subscription to prompt user if they want to keep said subscription.	positive
1769	1200318119	utility	1	I‚Äôm now on the line with Apple trying to get 20x$2.99 back. Over $50 for 20 weeks of charges from this App without the App even showing I‚Äôm in premium. That‚Äôs why I thought I was OK when I looked in the app even though while using my home button to get out of a wrong screen in the application it authorized the purchase of it. What a mess and yes it‚Äôs the application‚Äôs fault but everyone funnels through Apple to sort it out. I‚Äôm very, very frustrated now. I need a native app to read QR codes. Help!	negative
1770	1200318119	utility	1	I downloaded this app not realizing it cost $7.99 a month. I didn‚Äôt use it and deleted it immediately but see another post saying they were still charged for it. I went to the support page and tried to send them a message explaining what had happened but it wants me to choose a reason from a drop-down list, but when I tap on the arrow to try and bring up the list of reasons nothing happens and it won‚Äôt let me send my message without a reason. This is a total scam.	negative
1771	1200318119	utility	5	Despite all bad reviews listed, it worked for me just as described. Using iPad Pro 9.7, with iOS 11.4. Either it‚Äôs been upgraded or I‚Äôm smarter than I ever thought in making it work. Less than 7 minutes by following instructions included in package. Keep up great work.	positive
1772	1200318119	utility	5	I was looking for a quick and painless download to get the instructions for something. The app found the page when the page wouldn‚Äôt open manually. The ads are annoying but not a deal breaker.	negative

1774	1200318119	utility	1	Got the pro version downloaded and installed. Ok it said it‚Äôs a subscription. Figured yearly no problem. Then it did not work.  I contacts them. Left messages and no replies. I informed them I‚Äôm am removing the app and wanted a refund all within a week of installing it. No replies. Then today I get bills.  For renewal $3.99 for renewal every 7 days. Had to call the App Store techs and that are currently trying to get me a refund.  Beware of this product. It is a complete rip off.	neutral
1775	1200318119	utility	1	I uninstalled the free version app months ago, but uninstalled it because I never used it. But I just noticed last week a $7.99 charge on my credit card for the pro version. I never requested the pro version, and I haven‚Äôt even had the app on my phone for months. I cancelled the subscription (that I NEVER signed up for, and yes, I know how they try to sneak the subscription in‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt accept it), but unfortunately they won‚Äôt refund me any charges. Steer clear of this unethical developer.	positive
1776	1200318119	utility	1	This app will convert to subscription without you realizing it.  It has been identified by Forbes as one of  top grossing sneaky apps on the Apple Store.  It converted without our knowledge to 7.99 per month subscription. It appears apps are only free until they start automatically billing you. Since this has been known by the likes of Forbes and others since 2018, the appearance is that Apple endorses this behavior. Also, take a good look at the reviews. The 5 star reviews aren‚Äôt even for this app.  What a fraud!  Beware!!!	positive
1777	1200318119	utility	5	It seems to be a good app but if to Not Get charged you have to go to the profile of the app under SUBSCRIPTIONS and scroll down to the package you want because it will automatically put you on the $9.99 SUB. OR scroll down to CANCEL in red letters. Click on that.	negative

1779	1200318119	utility	1	I figured out how to stop it by just making a fake Apple Card and downloading it and going to settings to delete my subscription so I don‚Äôt get charged and if there charging your normal card and you already deleted it and it still charges you. You could make a Apple Card with no money and download it and then delete the subscription your welcome and don‚Äôt ever trade your phone to some dumb scam it‚Äôs literally pointless but make sure you follow the steps your welcome	positive

1781	1200318119	utility	1	I downloaded this free app to quickly scan something and then be done with it. Somehow during the one day I used the app I unknowingly subscribed to the ‚ÄúPro version‚Äù which has been charging me $4.99/week!!! Absolute BS, since when I open the app it does not show that I have a the Pro Version, but instead it does give me the option to subscribe, which further proves that it‚Äôs a scam, because why would I need that if I had already subscribed? Do not download this.	negative
1782	1200318119	utility	1	Downloaded this to scan a barcode on my lawn mower if you can believe it, to take me directly to the manual. trouble is, once you use the very easy to operate scan, wherever you get to, it‚Äôs impossible to see the web address let alone copy it, or download the PDF it took me to. So, if I want to read the manual, I have to navigate around all the ads, and squint to see it because the app doesn‚Äôt work well as a pdf reader (no pinch zoom). Deleted immediately.	positive
1783	1200318119	utility	1	Not only did it NOT work but the jerks call it ‚Äúfree‚Äù preying on the fact that not everyone scrolls all the way down to see that you will automatically be subscribed WEEKLY to the app. So I deleted the app..... because it DID NOT WORK and just found out I got charged for a weekly subscription (conveniently, deleting an app doesn‚Äôt negate automatic subscriptions) ... even though I had NO IDEA I had an automatic subscription! Hate it, don‚Äôt get it.	negative
1784	1200318119	utility	1	This app did work the one and only time I used it. Haven‚Äôt even opened it since. In fact, I got rid of the iPhone X the next day (that‚Äôs a whole other list of design flaws). Now I have found that they have been charging me for the most expensive subscription they have at $4.99 weekly!  I never signed up for anything. Apple is refunding the charges for me. It appears I‚Äôm not the only one that this is happening to. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this app to anyone!	positive
1785	1200318119	utility	4	I got an immediate response when I use the barcode and it was very efficient. The only negative I see is that I have to pay in order to not receive advertising. You should be paying me for receiving it, In my opinion. Over all, I like the app even though asked me to read it with only one use.	positive
1786	1200318119	utility	1	As someone already pointed out. It charges your Apple account a fee every month without you knowing till you see a charge (for me of 7.99) and when trying to track it down I found out the app had auto billed through my Apple account without my knowledge. It‚Äôs in the pages of terms of service. This should be on the store as monthly subscription. Not free and the price hidden in the terms of service. This is such a scam and Apple should be ashamed.	negative

1788	1200318119	utility	1	"First thing it shows when opening the app is a list of features, as you'd see whenever an app has been updated. Except that this is to trick you into purchasing the premium version, since it doesn't tell you that you're not launching the app, but rather purchasing the premium version.

Once you get pass that tricky opening screen, when you scan a barcode, it takes you to an Ad. Useless piece of app!"	negative
1789	1200318119	utility	5	I did not agree to buy this app and cannot get out of it! Ridiculous way to do business!  It‚Äôs a ZERO rating as one star is one star to many. And it forces you to rate it anyway....grr. It wanted a nickname under 30 letters and rejected 26 letters.	negative
1790	1200318119	utility	1	This app said it was free but when it was finishing the download I saw a payment screen flash by. I didn‚Äôt tap on anything to ‚Äúupgrade.‚Äù It took me 20 minutes to figure out how to unsubscribe. For those scammed like me, download the app, go into settings, go into subscription info and click on cancel trial. This unticks whichever plan they put you on. Then I deleted the app. I‚Äôll be watching my account for these charges. Hope this helps someone.	positive
1791	1200318119	utility	1	DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!!! The description does not clearly state that the ‚Äúfree‚Äù app is actually a 3 day trial, which if you do not cancel, it automatically subscribes you to a weekly $4.99 subscription. The description only ever states that you can upgrade to the premium 9.99 account. Besides the scam subscription, the app never even worked after trying to scan multiple QR codes from various sources and not one of them working.	negative
1792	1200318119	utility	1	This app was disappointing to me as I was never able to find the origin or price of any items I tried. ‚ÄúUnable to locate product‚Äù every time I tried scanning a barcode. I deleted the app as it was no use to me. Then 3 months later, I found that the app had been charging me $3.24 every week for the last 3 months and I had no idea. Way to take advantage of users. Unbelievable! Do not bother downloading.	negative
1793	1200318119	utility	1	I downloaded the app for free but as soon as I opened it I was informed that after one week free there was a $2.99/week fee so I promptly deleted the app thinking that it would not enroll me. However, upon reviewing my bank statement I saw two charges and found that I had been auto enrolled in the subscription even though I hadn‚Äôt even used the app and had it for no more than 5 minutes!! Currently on hold with Apple to dispute this, but what a pain >:(	negative
1794	1200318119	utility	4	Scanner works great, but auto-play ads with sound are disruptive. Wish sound would be muted by default with the option to enable, but doesn‚Äôt seem to be possible. Can‚Äôt beat the price though!	positive
1795	1200318119	utility	5	I did not know this app would actually work. But it did. I made a barcode for my email and my phone number and it is so easy to use. I love this app and you will too.	positive
1796	1200318119	utility	5	I like it because when point it at a barcode it instantly scans the barcode and then tells you what it is and how much money it is and what it was before.	positive
1797	1200318119	utility	1	This is a subscription, not a one time purchase or free app with ads. I don‚Äôt know why someone would need this and as far as I could tell it did nothing special and did not work as seamlessly as others. Granted I did not wait around to play with it after getting Apples notice I had subscribed to something. Stay away from this unless you know you need it for some reason.	positive
1798	1200318119	utility	5	I was at my food store when I needed a scanner to download some coupons.  I found this one and with a minute or two I was able to start scanning.  Thank you.	positive

1800	284882215	social	1	My two stars from the other week in regards to my saved items automatically being saved to a folder when they aren‚Äôt supposed to is now down to one star due to the newest excuse for an update. In the past I would be watching something and if I clicked on it to watch it bigger it would then show other suggested videos from Watch under it. That was fine. But now I will only be a few seconds into a video on my feed without touching it yet and it will COMPLETELY STOP the video and te me to continue watching  it on Watch. HOWEVER when I try to click the video to make it bigger and thus open it in Watch it won‚Äôt do jack squat. This tells me I would have to click over to Watch and then attempt to refind the video just to bloody watch it in the first place. I don‚Äôt know who was smoking the stupid juice this time, but I would rather watch no videos than have to go out of my way to hunt a video down just to watch after it‚Äôs already been presented in front of me. And as someone with a business page that posts videos (AND PAYS GOOD MONEY to use some as ads) it makes me want to cut back what I spend with you all if this is what my users will be left with. Please please PLEASE change it back.	negative
1801	284882215	social	2	"Let‚Äôs face it, if you use social media Facebook is a must have to stay connected.  However the Facebook app is a complete bug filled app that only seems to break more with every update.  I‚Äôve been waiting for years for it to work right and yet I always know when an update comes, because something you use regularly will break guaranteed.  If by some miracle it gets fixed in the bi-weekly update, I promise you something else you use will be hindered in the next version. 

Sorting has always been a mystery to me.  I understand sponsored posts and ads as something as to pay for the backend but I never understand why something as simple as seeing recent posts just doesn‚Äôt happen. Most recent is a joke...it just never works.  I constantly get days old posts in my news feed even if there‚Äôs been no replies to them.  If I see something and then accidentally refresh I may never find that post again because it‚Äôs lost in the Facebook algorithm.  

In the end Facebook is still the best way to post and share news and info with friends, but the constant failures of the app time after time makes it beyond frustrating and disappointing to use."	negative
1802	284882215	social	1	"If I could give 0 Stars, I would.. Facebook has locked me out of my account for days, saying they need to review a photo of me. There is no one to contact or email to fix it. I have had my account since about 2005 so it doesn‚Äôt make sense.. The Help Page is of no help because it consists of regular people who do not have access to unlock accounts. Facebook needs to have a direct contact via Chat or email to assist their customers.

When I was able to use the app, it had a lot of bugs and annoying features. It would randomly refresh on its own in the middle of me reading comments, have no rhyme or reason for organizing posts on the News Feed, and constantly suggest potential friends. Just because one friend of mine is friends with someone, doesn‚Äôt mean that I want to be.

My biggest pet peeve with Facebook is how invasive it is with announcing to all of your friends any time you like a page or comment on a public post. I feel like I can‚Äôt comment on a news article without every one of my friends seeing it on their News Feed so I stopped commenting on things a long time ago. This app is terrible, and I can‚Äôt even go experience the awfulness that it is because my account is locked.."	positive
1803	284882215	social	2	Greetings Facebook crew! The purpose I write to you is none other than to impart my report as well as to acquire assistance pertaining to Facebook account service. So today all of a sudden Facebook is asking me to submit a photo ID upon logging in; and I have uploaded and sent a photo of my driving license (genuine!). I have been using Facebook since 2009 if my memory serves me well and I never did infringe your ToU or regulations but somehow you team got me as using a fake profile name? I believe someone from within my friend list or a page (I don‚Äôt know as I followed/Liked tons of pages) was behaving mischievously and made a false accusation or report over my profile for no solid reason. What‚Äôs more, I did not do anything wrong ever since I use Facebook, or use the service for illegal purposes. Pretty please review my account suspension that does not hold water and reinstate it in next to no time. Please reach out to me please. It is the quarantine period and I need to work from home. Not to mention I have other foreign accounts that I link FB to login with. Thank you for your concern. Why do I have to bear a fault that is not mine?	positive
1804	284882215	social	2	The app is ok to deal with but the people you may know feature is completely annoying and frustrating. I must say it‚Äôs a nice feature but it gets frustrating when you remove people and the next day or a few days later they show up again as people you may know. Facebook needs to add a delete button for that and not just the remove button or the remove button should remove that person and their profile permanently because hitting the remove button only brings that person profile back up within a day or a few days. I‚Äôm completely irritated with it because if I hit the remove bottom it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt know that person, I don‚Äôt want to know that person, or don‚Äôt want to be friends with that person. I shouldn‚Äôt have to spend so much time ‚Äúremoving‚Äù but not permanently removing people from the ‚Äúpeople you may know‚Äù only for them to pop back up as people I may know 24-48hrs later!! IT‚ÄôS ANNOYING. STOP IT FACEBOOK LET ME PERMANENTLY REMOVE PEOPLE I DON‚ÄôT KNOW AND/OR DON‚ÄôT WANT TO KNOW OR BE BOTHERED WITH WITHOUT HAVING THEM POP UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. REVAMP THE ‚ÄúPEOPLE YOU MAY KNOW‚Äù FEATURE SO THAT IT CAN BE BETTER MANAGED BY US!! Thanks üò§üò§	negative
1805	284882215	social	2	There are several things that are frustrating.  1- if I mark See posts first, that means I want to see this persons posts first ‚Äî NOT three days later, and not after seeing countless posts from people not marked See first. See first means see first.  2 - when I scroll through my newsfeed I doesn‚Äôt want it to stop after 3 or 4 posts.  I want it to keep scrolling.  When I‚Äôve seen enough I will quit. If I delete the app it and reinstall, it will work for awhile but will behave the same way again soon.  3-  if I see a post on my Facebook iPad app, I should be able to also see it on my iPhone Facebook app.  Why aren‚Äôt these two newsfeeds consistent? 4 - if I have a custom list or a smart list, why can‚Äôt I click on that list and see posts from just those people?  5- if there are birthdays or events that show up in the right hand column, I don‚Äôt want to see the word DONE, I want to see the event or birthday.  Again, I can get this to work again if I delete and reinstall the app. Perhaps rather than working on enhancements the developers just need to fix the bugs, and then be sure future bug fixes don‚Äôt break things again.	positive
1806	284882215	social	3	"Didn‚Äôt have this problem until yesterday when the new update kicked in. Everything else works fine, notifications, clicking through group posts and whatnot. But as soon as I go to news feed before or after doing other things on the app it just freezes. I‚Äôve reset the app, I‚Äôve reset my phone, I‚Äôve cleared all of Facebook‚Äôs caches, and I‚Äôm going to try uninstalling and reinstalling next.

On another note, I was reminded after seeing someone else‚Äôs review about the group notifications as well. It‚Äôs rather annoying that Group notifications for new posts and what not see to be randomized. Sometimes I won‚Äôt get the notification for a new post, but suddenly I get one of a post that was posted hours or even days ago. The most annoying part about is when you go to the group and try to look at recent member posts, they‚Äôre randomized too, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to set it to most recently posted, I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs set to but it‚Äôs not even most liked or most commented, it‚Äôs absolutely random and that boggles my mind."	negative

I‚Äôve been banned twice and you wanna know what I was doing? Messaging my family group chat ABOUT MY AUNT BET WHO IS DYING!!!! Please either change this or just stop banning people for messaging too much and posting too much! You wanna know what ‚Äúweird activity‚Äù is? When an account is just made and messages so many people at once and friends so many people at once but when you‚Äôve had an account since 2011 I shouldn‚Äôt be flagged!!!!

I‚Äôm so tired of my Facebook being shut down while talking to friends and family or when I‚Äôm trying to sell something from market place or Facebook groups it‚Äôs absolutely redundant! If you‚Äôre going to ban people at least go into detail as of why not just ‚Äúderrrr your acting weird on facebook derrrr‚Äù it‚Äôs annoying! Especially when we‚Äôre STUCK AT HOME DUE TO THIS VIRUS!

Come to find out there's no live customer support... Honestly, how is that even legal???? Does it even matter how many accounts there are on Instagram? It's not like Mark Zuckerberg and Co have no money to hire people or something? I don't know maybe I'm just crazy. Because I thought they were pretty rich.
The layout and interface have been becoming more and more stupid and non-userfriendly for years, messenger is just silly with it's functionability.

So if I commented last week and I get a reply today I have absolutely no idea what the original post was about. 2) A notification disappears after I look at it. So if I have to refer back to it for any reason, I have to somehow find the page of the original poster and then hunt for the post. STUPID IDEA 3) When going to some notifications, when you click on it it takes you to a blank post. I see the persons name, the time they posted and maybe if someone reacted to it, but absolutely no post at all. There‚Äôs even comments on it but I see no post at all. Yes I have access to  their page, I haven‚Äôt been blocked and they call me to say ‚Äúdid you see my last post‚Äù and all I see is nothing. 
3) Auto refresh is annoying. Someone posts an article and I take 2-3 minutes reading it and when I go to comment on it, you‚Äôve refreshed my feed. Thanks for nothing.

I'm almost ready to delete the darn thing!  Wondering if it's worth the frustration! I've written my problems to the staff through Facebook three times and have received no recommendations. Can the app be fixed?

Well, it's about 2 ,months later and nothing has improved. The  app still freezes and blacks out. If I try to move from a post to attached info it freezes.  Moving down the page to more posts makes it freeze or it blacks out completely. Then I get to start all over opening the app yet again. This is really getting to be more trouble than it's worth.

1813	284882215	social	1	Nobody wants a game page or a group page. It‚Äôs amazing how many different ways you want to send me push notifications, that I literally only click on so that it will go away. I went in to change my notification settings and it turns out you will not let me turn off all group notifications at once and I have to go through a list and manually select out of 100 groups which ones I want, the slider for all is greyed out. This is totally unnecessary, and nobody asked for this. Why do I have a notification for every time someone goes live? Anytime an event is added at a venue I checked into ONE TIME that‚Äôs across the world in a different country? Facebook notifications used to notify me when someone wanted to talk to me, and I‚Äôve done my best to continually update my setting but it‚Äôs getting crazy. Now I‚Äôll have 7 notifications and check it and not a single one is about a friend I have that was reaching out to me. Events, game page, so and so went live, so and so checked in safe, I have memories from 10 years ago to look at, so and so posted in this group, like I do. Not. Care. And I don‚Äôt need a red push notification making it seem like I should.	positive
1814	284882215	social	2	For the last 2 months, the notification settings in the app are a complete mess.  The app will have the red number, but one of them are about my own posts. Any reactions or comments to MY posts don‚Äôt load in the list of notifications, so I have no idea about comments or reactions unless I actually go to the post itself.  All I see are notifications about my friends‚Äô posts.  Further, while the news feed works fine, the list of notifications is limited to EXACTLY 20 notifications.  When I scroll to the bottom, the page just jumps and doesn‚Äôt refresh to show any more than exactly 20.  Maybe once a week I will scroll and be surprised to be able to scroll past 20, but it‚Äôs not because of anything I did or didn‚Äôt do.  AND once I scroll back to the top of the list and scroll back down, I‚Äôm limited to 20 again.   AND notifications for my posts still aren‚Äôt in the list.  I have a brand new iPhone 6s Plus (3 months), so if Facebook doesn‚Äôt fix it soon, I am going to be convinced that the problems are a way to push people to upgrade their phones to the newest versions.	negative

This was great. I‚Äôm a mom to a toddler and I oftentimes have to multitask. NOW, if I switch to a different app or put my phone down for 10 SECONDS to do something else, my newsfeed refreshes, and starts at the top. This is infuriating when I‚Äôm in the middle of reading an article or looking at an album of pictures. What is the purpose of this? Who is it benefitting? Certainly not your users. I find myself getting on Facebook less and less these past few weeks because I get more annoyance than enjoyment out of it. Do you not do any kind of market research before you implement these things? And please, get rid of the camera. Everyone and their brother has a camera on their phone. I think we‚Äôre set! I‚Äôm tired of swiping left to exit a post and accidentally hitting the camera which takes 10 seconds to load.  I can‚Äôt imagine what your UI/QA teams get paid to ‚Äúok‚Äù these poorly planned ‚Äúenhancements‚Äù.	positive

There are many cases that people are ‚Äúhacked‚Äù, when in reality they just gave away their password. I‚Äôve been using the Internet since I was in 3rd grade and i‚Äôve never been hacked. I‚Äôm in college now!

Yeah, there are many annoying things about facebook, such as videos on ads, suspicious advertisements, political drama, etc
I just try to ignore those. Simple as scrolling past them.

However I think Facebook is pretty good in some aspects. For instance, I follow many pages relating to art and I joined many art groups. They show up constantly in my feed, which I absolutely adore! I rarely, if not ever, see anything that I‚Äôm uninterested in despite following over a thousand pages of many varieties

What‚Äôs sad though is that I don‚Äôt get to see majority of the art pages as much. Because they don‚Äôt have hundreds of thousands of followers, the algorithm attracts less feedback to their posts. 
At least I get to see the group posts very often.
I only use facebook for the artist community, my friends, and messaging them. 
Everything else about facebook is...ehh?

Just don‚Äôt do anything stupid and randomly click on everything. Remember to always be skeptical on this site!"	positive
1818	284882215	social	2	Here recently videos have started displaying this keep watching button right in the middle of the video. If I‚Äôm just scrolling through my newsfeed and want to watch a video in it‚Äôs entirety then I should be able to do that!! Not only that but then I also have to deal with the ads in the video too! It‚Äôs frustrating and makes the app not very enjoyable to use! Also, the back/forward arrows on a webpage need to be put back where they were at the bottom of the page. It‚Äôs too easy now to hit the X button to close a webpage when all I really wanted to do was go back a page. Very frustrating when you‚Äôve been looking at something for a long time only for it to close and then the newsfeed refreshes and you‚Äôve lost the link you were looking at originally. None of the other apps (Pinterest, Instagram) do this. Their back/forward buttons are at the bottom of the screen, away from the ‚ÄúX‚Äù button so you don‚Äôt risk closing your page. It‚Äôs little thing like this that make or break an app. And right now Facebook, you‚Äôre on the verge of falling apart.	negative

But there‚Äôs just one thing that makes me mad. You guys took away my market place, I‚Äôve contacted help and support so many times about it. I‚Äôve gone to that stupid webpage that tells you steps and none of that stuff is even on my page like to request a review.

I did nothing wrong. I sold antique dolls my mom got when she was younger, I sold a model helicopter and a skateboard. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all I was selling. And I was completely transparent in telling people the damages they had and pricing them reasonably. So I know I didn‚Äôt break any of your rules. I saw that it could be cause I was inactive. Sense I have become a lot more active. I‚Äôm on everyday, I update my profile picture all the time, I joined groups and I‚Äôm always talking in those. I even like and comment of some of my friends and families post so I know that being inactive isn‚Äôt the problem anymore. I also know that marketplace is in fact active where I live cause I‚Äôm in Texas! ALSO the entire icon is gone and hasn‚Äôt returned."	positive

I have to switch off the app sounds daily. It‚Äôs obnoxious! I never wanted them in the first place. How many times will I have to inform the app that I want the sounds shut off for good? It is unpleasant to hear cheesy clicking and clacking sounds as you simply move from post to post on Facebook. Horrible idea.

It‚Äôs not only that. This is the largest most bloated battery sucking app there is. It bogs down my phone. What others have said about the updates consuming all of their storage is absolutely true. I wasn‚Äôt going to write a negative review even for the constant unnecessary toggling on of the app sounds, but every time there‚Äôs an update for this app there is no room for it on my phone. I have almost nothing on my phone. How is this app mobile friendly in any way? It‚Äôs a behemoth. I‚Äôm going to collect my personal photos and documents from it and delete it. I‚Äôll happily find other places to socialize on the Internet. Sorry."	negative

Wasn‚Äôt like this before, but either they‚Äôre under new management or their bots are now hypersensitive. I didn‚Äôt even get told what I did wrong, only that I posted something offensive in one of the many groups I‚Äôm in (I‚Äôm in a group for people to share offensive opinions, so yeah I‚Äôm going to post something there that may be construed that way because that is what that group is for!) and that I‚Äôm blocked from posting until April 1. April 1 came and I tested it out, still blocked until 8:22 the morning they said. It‚Äôs 8:58 now and I‚Äôm still blocked, but no explanation this time. I‚Äôve had posts taken down before that don‚Äôt break any laws or advocate breaking any laws, but are simply funny memes that I share to specific groups so I don‚Äôt offend anyone who is outside of that group and not wanting to see it. Even been banned just for posting my opinions, no threats, no attacking people, just operating my right to freedom of speech! They shouldn‚Äôt call themselves a public platform if they can‚Äôt uphold the rights of the public.	negative
1822	284882215	social	1	Please find a way not to show all your friends when you‚Äôre on FB. I sometimes like to zone out on FB just to pass the night. It is very very annoying to receive pop-ups in the wee small hours of the night from people (most often men) whom I barely know. There are no boundaries on Messenger. What I mean by this is that anyone can Message or even call anyone else whether they are friends or not. I have been harassed and annoyed in this manner also by a man who was drunk and didn‚Äôt want to take no for an answer in the middle of the night, calling on Messenger over and over again. I had to threaten to call police. How did he know I was awake and alone? Messenger!  It can also bring up trust issues with people in relationships who don‚Äôt know if their significant other is live chatting with a side piece or playing FarmVille in the wee small hours of the night. I‚Äôm a private person who likes to keep my business to myself. Find a way, please, to let the user decide whether or not they want to let anyone or no one pop up and interrupt their lives with Messenger. I regularly install and then uninstall, when it could just be so easy to fix it. Please do.	positive
1823	284882215	social	1	I use my iPad exclusively for managing a business page on facebook. IT IS INFURIATING. Nothing works properly. The app skips around, comments don‚Äôt post occasionally, and the worst is trying to dig through a whole post to find where someone has tagged me in a comment. For some reason, notifications don‚Äôt bring me to the tag or reply, it just sends me to the general post or group and I have to DIG for it. It‚Äôs a huge waste of my time and a hinderance to my business. Then, in the browser, it inserts double spaces every time I hit the space bar. This is a confirmed Facebook problem, not the fault of Apple, safari, or chrome. It is the same across all browsers. Some have theorized that this is so facebook can force you to use the app, where they have more room for advertising, but THE APP DOESN‚ÄôT WORK EITHER. If I was not dependent on Facebook for my business, I flat out would not use it. It‚Äôs terrible. Terrible platform, terrible apps, terrible algorithm codes. You‚Äôd think a multi million dollar company would at least be competent enough to resolve the double-space issue in the browser. Ridiculous. FIX IT.	negative

This feature has gone away before; I reported it and it was restored. Now, after the latest update it‚Äôs gone again. 

A basic business adage is to ""keep it sold"" which means taking care of your current customers while you also develop new ones. You've already got millions of us sold on Facebook, so quit screwing around with the app and just give us a stable, reliable feed. Let the users decide what they see in their wall and in what order. I understand you make money from ads, so go ahead and put them out there, but let us manage our own content and interaction with our own friends, groups and pages. The more your developers keep tweaking with the app, the less appealing it becomes and the more unstable. Now it keeps freezing and quitting, making it difficult to post. Do you even ask your users what kind of changes they want before messing with the app & your stupid algorithms?"	negative
1825	284882215	social	1	I have an idea!! Instead of pretending your app is perfect, how about make a place where people can actually report issues with the programming?? Like false information!! If I put someone on ignore and have their messages go into the spam folder, why can they still call me thru messenger?? Why am I getting the notification that they are calling when it clearly states they will NOT be able to call?? Fix that.. Also, I loathe that when I pause a video and put my phone down, the video starts playing again.. That makes absolutely no sense at all.. Why have a pause button?? It seems like the ‚Äúupdates‚Äù that happen every two weeks are just adding more minor inconveniences and prohibiting more and more options, like changing your name.. Also, why are people I have on my blocked list placed on the list of people to share posts with?? I went to share a post on a specific persons page and two people I have on my blocked list were on that list of people to share with.. WHAT?! Makes so sense!! Please fix the real issues and stop adding garbage to the app.. Sound good?? You have the resources, your facility is huge enough..	positive

I don‚Äôt get any error messages. On the posts that do show up: 1. comments don‚Äôt load at all 2. videos freeze after max 10-15 seconds 3. when I react to or comment on something it never actually posts it; next time I load the app and see the post I commented on, my both my comment & reaction don‚Äôt show up. 
Today it got to the point that when I opened the app, it just says ‚Äúnetwork error, tap to retry‚Äù and of course tapping ‚Äúretry‚Äù does nothing. 
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app multiple times. The first time seemed to fix it but the next day it was acting up again. The second time it started acting up within a few hours. This time it went from ‚Äútap to retry‚Äù to just acting buggy. The app keeps degrading to the point where I literally cannot use it on my phone which is my main source of using Facebook; I rarely if ever go on Facebook on the computer.

However it still telling me my card is not going trough and I‚Äôm just soo confused as to why am I being charged, thankfully I have never put down my card information. Tried contact them and see why it‚Äôs saying I owe $25 dollar but no response... customer service is just trash and non existent. Every time I upload a video or a prerecorded storie it takes several hours and sometimes days to actually upload ... that‚Äôs ridiculous!! 
My all time favorite was instagram but now facebook owns instagram too and little by little instagram is becoming trash too. To upload a video is taking longer than ever.. and now the inbox messages are blue? Eww

1828	284882215	social	3	I‚Äôve been a faithful Facebook user for years. It is my go to social media platform and I love it. However for the last couple months I‚Äôve noticed it won‚Äôt load random things. Images, comments, and video will stop loading if I‚Äôve been scrolling for a minute or two. Sometimes I‚Äôll be just hopping on and comments won‚Äôt load for something. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm on WiFi or data. I‚Äôve even gone as far as to uninstall it and reinstall it twice this week, which worked for that night and stopped the next day. I never used to have this problem until after I got the iPhone X. My husband just switched phones to the iPhone X like me (got mine on Mother‚Äôs Day) and now he experiences it too, and we have friends who say they noticed it as well on this phone but when they switched phones, it was all good. Is there possibly a compatibility flaw between Facebook and the new iPhone? I hate not being able to use it like I used to. Hopefully this can be fixed so we can keep using it.	positive
1829	284882215	social	2	I am a member of a lot of groups and rely on my email notifications to decide which posts to actually read and which to ignore. Unfortunately, FB made that impossible several months ago when, during an update, my email notifications suddenly became two lines instead of the full post. I‚Äôm assuming that was to force me to visit FB more often. What‚Äôs worse, is that in a recent update, when I click on the ‚Äúview on Facebook‚Äù button in the email notification, instead of taking me directly to the post I want to read, FB now takes me to a random video in the FB watch tab. Presumably to get me to watch more videos. But all it‚Äôs doing is frustrating me to no end. Now, the latest, is when I manually try to find the post I want to read by looking at my notifications tab, the post doesn‚Äôt show up until I refresh the group page, which never used to be the case. It is all a downward spiral that makes me wish I could just stop using FB and try something else. Stop updating the app to make it less convenient for users!	negative
1830	284882215	social	1	I have been a holdout since Facebook started. I finally gave in so I could see what was going on with family.  This has been the most stressful annoying experience ever.  No tech support while developer Mark is a billionaire.   I also several times a week only have about 6 items and the feed ends.  Log out and back in. Did setting for a couple people to be on the top of my feed.  Never are.  My daughter is trying to Like things and gets a ‚Äòthis action is blocked ‚Äò reply and tells it 20 times that it‚Äôs a mistake and then it happens again.  Then it locked her account.   Then you have to identify 5 people who are friends to convince FB that you are still really you.  Then she had to change password two different times in two days and she‚Äôs an expert at this app.  Ruining my vacation trying to post our things and encounter glitch after glitch.  Oh log out AGAIN!!!! Try AGAIN!!   By the volume of all these crappy reviews I would think the boss would want to fix these bugs and actually be an above standard app.   Guess you don‚Äôt care anymore once you get really rich.   Hate this app.	negative

Seriously over this app. I‚Äôm about to delete it and just use safari, because it‚Äôs got so many issues and just not worth it anymore. I now have the 8 plus and have had nothing but issues since I updated the other day. 

Old review: So my FB app was working fine until I updated it. I have an iPhone 6 Plus and I use the app to upload photos of my daughter. Well after I updated it I went to upload photos and the app closed out on me, it freezes when I try to go back on it, it won't let me upload more that 40 photos/videos at a time, it's sluggish when it will let me on, and no matter how many times I turned my phone off or uninstalled the app and reinstalled it it's still doing the same thing. I'm over it. When the app is running better and won't kick me off of it while trying to upload photos let me know, but until then I'm deleting it and using safari."	positive

Also it‚Äôs just annoying every time it takes me to the other app. It‚Äôs just as acting like Snapchat and it doesn‚Äôt do the best job. I would also recommend having the settings be a little more comfortable and less confusing for everyone thank you. I would also recommend NOT having soooo many ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù it‚Äôs so annoying and it‚Äôs so crowded. I would also like my feed to NOT RESET every time. it is VERY difficult to find a post when almost nothing is in order and TOO MANY suggested posts appear!! I would also like an option to be able to delete EVERY SINGLE post. It would also be MORE comfortable(in my opinion)to have the RESHARED POSTS be on a different category to posts I ACTUALLY made.

I keep my friends list very limited to under 20 people tops (mostly family and not even friends & co-workers) so that I can share video and photos with them about life events. I also post news commentary. I know about the NSA thing with Snowden. This is not what has upset me. Now, Facebook is publicly threatening that instead of just the algorithm and a relatively small team of content curators based out of Facebook's HQ, they are planning to hire an army of up to 20,000 human content police! I have real fears that one of these 20,000 strong may end up being a nosy neighbor down the street. I don't like the idea of having 20,000 people capable of seeing my posts that I don't even know who they are. The NSA is in Maryland, Facebook is in California. I was not worried about people from either of those groups being a neighbor living next door to me that I do not want to have access to my information! I am very weird in what I post (ufo stuff). Im sick of having to worry if my neighbor might happen to be a Facebook mod, like those in the website Nextdoor in which I am constantly tearing up snail mail invites for.	negative

I think Facebook needs to implement a system that avoids the use of Same names . Because personally i even found one of my photos being uploaded to someone‚Äôs timeline.. Even though that didn‚Äôt annoyed me.. But facebook should provide strong control over the user‚Äôs photo.. so that i wont be downloaded in other devices. Even though some of pic may be screenshot. Facebook should also implement a system like face identifying AI to identify the use of multiple photos of same user over different account. I mean to say to have new kinds of notification and alerts if some . Even if some people decide to make backup account their previously used mobile number to verify, the creation of account of same user allowing to upload the photo signifying its really the same guy...	positive

1840	284882215	social	1	"So today Facebook decided it would block me from blocking ads.  I don‚Äôt want to see your ads, so I block them.  Then I get a message that says, ‚ÄúIt looks like you were misusing this feature by going too fast.  You‚Äôve been blocked from using it.‚Äù  I am not misusing anything.  I‚Äôm blocking the ridiculous amount of ads you suddenly put on my feed.  How dare you force advertisements upon me by not letting me block them.  That is absolutely ridiculous.  Every third post there‚Äôs an ad.  I don‚Äôt care about the trash you‚Äôre trying to force me to buy.  I don‚Äôt want to see it.  I didn‚Äôt have a problem before today.  I only ever saw my friend‚Äôs posts.  I have 2,700 pages blocked because I don‚Äôt want to see ads.  I use your service to connect with friends.  I am so disgusted by this.  What point is there in blocking me from hiding ads?  

Another problem I have is that the, ‚ÄúMost Recent‚Äù button is completely broken.  Every single post on the most recent feed is in exactly the same order as the regular feed.  That is not the most recent stuff.  I‚Äôm deleting this app.  I can‚Äôt even understand the foolery."	negative
1841	284882215	social	1	Facebook updates regularly and adds or adjusts features but never seems to fix actual problems. Of course, Facebook is feedback-aversive. A new issue has popped up - when you share a post and select ‚ÄúWrite‚Äù so you can add notes, the predictive text doesn‚Äôt work properly. If you‚Äôre typing and then click on the completed word and hit space afterward, it actually backspaces and erases the last letter of the word that was just put there. If you don‚Äôt catch it and retype the last letter and hit space and start typing the next word, you end up with one long word instead of two. This is is s new glitch that Facebook hasn‚Äôt bothered to fix in its many updates since the glitch started. Also now when I open the app, I have maybe two or three posts and it will not scroll down any further. I guess Mark Zuckerburg is too busy helping Trump and fascism to really give a rat‚Äôs behind about what‚Äôs going on with the app. (You can catch a thirty day ban if you insult a snowflake Republican, but by all means start a white nationalist page that openly promotes sedition because that‚Äôs okay according to Facebook.)	negative

People are only able to see a few posts before they can‚Äôt scroll any further. Weeks old posts are labeled as recent. Comments on posts either don‚Äôt appear, or you have to keep clicking ‚Äúmost relevant‚Äù then ‚Äúall posts‚Äù to get them to appear. The flagging algorithm is a total mess. Anyone can be accused of ‚Äúhate speech‚Äù and will be punished for it, even when nothing remotely resembling hate speech was said. Meanwhile, someone can make one racist comment after another, get reported, and nothing happens to them. Pictures showing no nudity or sexual content get flagged for ‚Äúviolating community standards‚Äù while pictures actually containing nudity, are allowed to stay. Typing is becoming nearly impossible. The space button either doesn‚Äôt work, inserts ‚Äú.‚Äù, or completely changes the typed words into gibberish. Using predictive texting results in more gibberish. I could go on and on. Fix your app/website, before you end up going the way of Tom, and his Space. Because that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre headed.	negative

I always been skeptical when people told me Facebook was recording them without their permission to advertise something and told them it‚Äôs their ‚ÄúKroger card‚Äù grocery store they get a discount card on a deal that Kroger can send Facebook their receipt. That‚Äôs not it! Until it happened to me! I have never purchased or looked up sudifed online or anything like it even Tylenol or anything else online  pain reliever in my life. One day at work I had a headache and asked my coworker for sudifed and and she mentioned the word and then I did that was the only time we ever talked about it and sure enough I check my FB 24 hours later like everyone else within a day or two and as pops up ‚ÄúSudifed extra strength‚Äù very next day remember I have never bought or looked this up I never needed to. Why does Facebook have access to our mic when it‚Äôs not in iPhone setting showing they have permission? They lied!	positive

I am tired of there ""fixes"" apparently there is not testing department there anymore they use the public to test.  The marketplace searching now stopped working with the latest update.  Does not matter what I search for nothing shows up no matter how far out I look.  I can see the items and search for the title of the items I see still nothing.  The recent posts I want to see what happened with my friends since the last time I was on and that is a total joke.

You can‚Äôt ask them to review your profile to lift the block. Every day it just tell me I‚Äôm temporarily block but don‚Äôt say for how long or anything. I didn‚Äôt post or share anything offensive. I was playing the omg game right before bed. I woke up the next day to a temporarily block, I tried to contact support on multiple occasions no one ever got back to me. It‚Äôs super annoying, that I can‚Äôt even connect with my family or friends because Facebook block me for posting, sharing, sending or receiving friends request, and I can‚Äôt send message on messenger for posting to many things at a short time according to they policy. I don‚Äôt understand isn‚Äôt that the point of social media to post and interact with others. I can post on Twitter, Snapchat and instagram all day without getting block.

1846	284882215	social	1	I know that writing a review is pointless because, for years I‚Äôve watched Facebook members complain about the same problems, over and over but, Facebook doesn‚Äôt listen. Facebook does it their way regardless of what its members request. The only reason Facebook has this review section is because Apple requires it. Facebook has never listened to its members, and never will. This app continues to be the most unreliable, complicated, cluttered mess I‚Äôve ever seen. The news feed shows what Facebook wants you to see, instead of what your friends post, in the order it was posted. There are so many irrelevant advertisements on your timeline and you can‚Äôt even watch any videos without Facebook forcing you to watch another irrelevant commercial they‚Äôve inserted into the video. Also, this is the most invasive app in the App Store. Facebook mines your personal information 24/7. The app uploads the contacts from your phone without you knowing and shares the information with everyone. **there are many more problems with this horrible app but, I‚Äôm out of time. I‚Äôll be back to write more later**	negative

Blocking pages, posts, kicking people off of the site (FaceBook Jail) for non threatening viewpoints your admins don‚Äôt agree with, and showing biased counter articles to liked articles are just a few examples.

I‚Äôm sure you do know this, as it seems the large majority of your employees are also extremely biased. 

FaceBook used to be a great place for family and friends to connect, and it still is to a large degree. So many oversized companies such as yours are committing suicide by becoming hyper political.

When I press the play button it starts over about three seconds before the video stopped and then does it again at the same point. Not only that,  but my news feed refuses to load anything more than about three status updates or ads and you can‚Äôt refresh it what so ever. This is getting incredibly annoying. I don‚Äôt know if anyone else is having the same issues but it‚Äôs frustrating when I can only see three post from hours ago along with only half of a posted video. Also, it‚Äôs not my service because this happens with my data and over WiFi. It‚Äôs complete garbage. Another thing is the whole friend suggestions, I get you guys are trying new things but that‚Äôs about as annoying as you suggesting that I would like posts in the marketplace that I never even use.

And I am still kicking myself every day for doing so. Sprint did not honor the buy one get one free iphone offer that I switched for. They sent me two little cheap lg phones and made me pay FOR BOTH before I could add an iphone on my daughters line that I also paid for at the apple store. About six months after i switched from the lg and sent it back AFTER I PAID FOR IT, I noticed Sprint was charging me a monthly lease fee for my apple phone. NOTHING has been corrected I have the worst experiences trying to communicate with Sprint as they are based out of the middle east. I am also a single mother that works very hard for her money, AND I am battling cancer on top of this cellular nightmare. Sprint has been ripping me off for almost 3 years and no one wants to take responsibility or take action to correct their mistake. I am still being drug through the ringers and regret ever making the switch. I wish I could go back and rethink the decision but the damage is done. And as soon as I am able to look around for a different carrier I am canceling Sprint and never looking back!! Save yourself a bundle and a whole lot of precious time and dont get caught up in the Sprint web of greedy money hungry lies!	negative
1851	491126018	utility	1	So I have made many mistakes in my life but switching to sprint is up there. Like many other fools we were swindled into the buy one get one free buyback offer. Well, what they don‚Äôt tell you is that T-mobile are the only phones that are comparable with sprint so basically everyone else‚Äôs phones are not eligible. The app did t work at all for me so the manager had to submit my old bill to which I am yet to receive both credits more than two months later. Besides that terrible promotion the cell service takes you back to when cell phones were first invented. Everything is muffled, calls drop and I can‚Äôt call my wife if she‚Äôs right outside the door without it sounding like I‚Äôm calling another country. My bill is almost twice as high because I was misquoted. AT&T is so superior to sprint from Custer service all the way to service. I regret ever walking into a store thinking that their promotion was at all accurate. Do yourself a favor and never use sprint. They don‚Äôt follow through, they lie, they don‚Äôt resolve problems, everything is outsourced like customer service all the way to the third party company that sends you a credit card for turning in your phone. I hate sprint yet I‚Äôm stuck with them. Go to any other network. Their commercials are all lies.	positive

And they didn‚Äôt even refund me back my money completely. I had the service no more than 15 days because the service was just so terrible! I would disconnect from the WiFi of my home and it wouldn‚Äôt let listen to music or do anything. My iPhone messages were coming out green and not even sending. I decided to deactivate the lines and return the phones. Sprint made me drive all the way to the place where I bought them(3 hours away from where I live!!) just to return them. I get to the corporate store by brickyard in Chicago and they won‚Äôt let me return them or cancel my line without having the headphones and chargers. I went to another sprint store nearby and they gladly took them. They told me to call customer support to cancel the lines and customer support told me to tell the sprint store to cancel the lines. It was very frustrating. I ended up FINALLY being able to cancel the lines and return the phones. I paid 944 dollars to start the service and for the phones. I got back 300 dollars. TERRIBLE! Don‚Äôt get Sprint!!! They will do everything in their hands to not let you deactivate your account!!!!	negative

Called Sprint numerous times due to degrading data access to the point where I had to walk around my house and garage to get a data signal.  Nothing but lip service from Sprint except that ‚Äòour equipment shows the 3G is working fine‚Äô and get this - blamed the poor data signal in a tree lol!   It got to the point that I was going into extended coverage and roaming at my house.  They filed a technical issue report but no action - when I called back they told me my issue wasn‚Äôt a high enough priority to investigate yet.  No solutions offered until I threatened to switch carriers then all of the sudden I could get a ‚ÄòMagic Box‚Äô signal booster that wouldn‚Äôt be available in the warehouse for 6-8 weeks, and they offered me an insulting $10 per month reduced bill.  Why would I continue to pay anything for services they promise but don‚Äôt deliver?  Switched to Verizon and instantly I can have multiple apps open concurrently while uploading pictures, no more buffering on Pandora and videos, can actually use my data during a phone conversation.  I will never do business with Sprint again and will tell anyone that asks to go someplace other than Sprint because you‚Äôll be throwing away your money.	negative

I have switched to sprint from AT&T with a hope of better coverage and stable and consistent bill every month .. it seems with all efforts I am still faced with an unpredictable bill each month .. I am a single mother working full time and sadly can‚Äôt afford to spend hours in the store waiting (with appointments even )  and or be on the phone to resolve my issues ... I have made so much effort to spend time on the phone with customer service to fix my plan ,, realizing after that nothing has been changed and it has to start from scratch again ... my account it seems has not changed to unlimited as it was set up from this time last year ...and I have been billed all this time with unnecessary charges ... I‚Äôm sad I can‚Äôt tackle this properly in any way ..  I have 7 months to end my lease with my phones and I wi be forced to shop towards another carrier ..

Which is next week. Both woman whom I spoke with, we‚Äôre not at all helpful, mindful, kind, etc. Everyone has trials and errors. I‚Äôm a single parent that has to have communication (via phone,) incase of an emergency, and I was simply not only doing what the guy before had told me to do, but was hoping would give me a chance so I‚Äôm not deeper in the whole, and to be kind and courteous to their customers.

When signing up for renewal I was asked  by The store associate if I was interested in a free hotspot. I replied absolutely free and the associate said yes. He just had to add another number to make that happen. So I agreed and upon getting my first bill I noticed my bill was $30 higher then quoted and when I called to dispute the charges Sprint said that I signed up for a hotspot and that was it $30 charge. I then explained to sprint that my hotspot was told to me that it was free. Then Sprint told me that I signed for it and was responsible for the charge. I‚Äôve tried several times to dispute this and it‚Äôs been over one year. If you look at my bill I never activated the hot spot. So unless I get credited for my year plus of being charged and not using that service my next alternative is to go about it with legal action. My fianc√© and her daughter were there at the time to witness The whole transaction. We‚Äôll see how this review is handled. If I haven‚Äôt heard back by Wednesday you leave me no choice but legal action. This has been way overdue and drawn out without any results. Thank you, Bill nadeau.	positive

Also bought a Refurbished iPhone 7 and the home button looked to be Scratched which I could live with when getting home it started act up when using the home button a closer inspection reveals it is cracked,
So took it back and was exchange for another,
Using this second iPhone the hearing was horrible and could only be heard well on loud speakers,
Took it back and they said it was a Typical iPhone  WoW these guys are good the one I was dealing with both times was a pretty nice guy but would be better and probably a bit Smarter if he would stay off the Opioids, the other person was having a conversation with a girlfriend or a Hot Momma and really didn‚Äôt have time for my problems.

However, despite paying for Sprint Open World, there was absolutely NO WAY to receive help from Sprint outside the country. When I tried to pay bill recently while traveling, neither the app nor the website were available. The app said I was not an authorized user and the website said it was not authorized for use on that server. If you are going to offer what you call international service, you need to make sure you have a way for customers to contact Sprint when they are abroad. YOUR texts asking for payment came through fine (you charged for them!), but when in desperation I tried to text Sprint‚Äîeven to call customer service, your customer help was completely unavailable. It was frustrating enough for me to think about seeing if another carrier has better international support, despite my being with Sprint a long time. Very disappointing.	positive

And, if I‚Äôm unlimited talk, text and wireless, WHY does my bill keep drifting upward, when I‚Äôve only had this phone a few months? It only proves my point further, which is that this dipstick app is intended purely as a SALES TOOL. It‚Äôs ALL about the MONEY. Check. ANNNND, you can tell which reviews are from your Marketing Dept, Sprint. Sheesh. Give it a rest. I‚Äôm looking (‚ÄúMost Recent Reviews‚Äù) at an endless stream of ONE STAR REVIEWS.

Since the app is MOSTLY for payment, finding and/or upgrading lease plans (in other words MOSTLY sales-related) and I‚Äôm auto-pay, WHY would I bother updating the app? Makes about as much sense as anything to do with Sprint, which is ZERO (if you‚Äôre not Sprint). Sprint has made it ABUNDANTLY clear it‚Äôs ALL about the cash, not customers.

As I paid off the phone, I never received a notification that I had completed paying my phone off. I come to find out in 2019 I was still getting charged for a lease after overpaying about $400 on this phone over the years. Because I didn‚Äôt call in or specify that I wanted to ‚Äúown‚Äù the phone...they assumed I wanted to keep paying for a lease...which just blows my mind. Who in the right mind would put a down payment of $400 just so they could keep paying more on top of that later. (This was the explanation of the customer service rep) Anyways, upon asking for a refund they were unhelpful and I got hung up on a total of 5 times while being pretty chill about it all. I suspect sprint customer service knows the problem exists and their trained to avoid it. Another friend has gone through this same thing with Sprint. Needless to say I have Verizon now...it‚Äôs better service....I have a way better phone....and I‚Äôm paying $4 less a month. I‚Äôll never be back sprint. Thanks for making my choice easy.	positive

Now a minor inconvenience was, when u click on a phone for more details and then go back to the list, it automatically puts the sort back to the ‚ÄòFeatured‚Äô which was not fun having to update back to lowest monthly payment.

I have about three or four reps. that I‚Äôve been talking to for the last three months to no results that only made my bill increase for lack of communication and improper information.... I will be reporting you all to the proper authority unless we solve this matter immediately. Someone needs more training or your representative are not doing a proper or well enough job to be dealing with peoples account and livelihood for this much confusion!! Hope to hear something soon not later. Suppose to get a call back today, we‚Äôll see!	positive

1871	491126018	utility	5	I recently switched from AT&T and am pleasantly surprised at how much better cell phone reception i‚Äôm getting. Bought an iPhone X and got the phone for half the price with a military discount. Living on a military base where hardly anyone gets good service really put the phone to the test. I had a lot of dropped calls and missed text messages with AT&T, particularly inside buildings. Not with Sprint. The 4G LTE internet seems to be faster too. Everything is just working better and i‚Äôm paying less than AT&T for the unlimited data plan. I was skeptical at first knowing that a lot of people have had bad experiences with Sprint in the past but they have really improved their service recently and are on par with or better than Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, the big three companies. You have to try it for yourself to believe it.	positive
1872	491126018	utility	5	I tried all of Sprints competitors before I became a Sprint customer.  This review is for the Hooper Ave., Toms River, NJ store.  I have never had any problems with Sprint.  I never had to return anything I bought there and the price is right.  Their store  manager and sales people are friendly and they will go out of their way to help you.  They have the same people working there 4 years ago when I first walked into that store. They only sell phones, tablets, speakers, and accessories.  They don't sell home security or whatever else their competitors are selling.  And Sprint has great sales at different times.  I have no problem with wi-fi or cellular and no dropped calls.  Thank you Sprint for your great service and being honest with me when I wasn't sure what to buy.  Keep up the great work and do not change, please keep it just a phone store.	positive
1873	491126018	utility	1	Sprint customer service representative are under trained. I had an issue with my bill after paying my iPhone off. Sprint customer service representatives always had a different amount for my payment. If it weren‚Äôt for one online customer service representative that understood the billing I would have been paying sprint double what I really owed them. Also I paid my phone off but was also charged a rental fee for the same month. I should have been credited the rental fee after the phone was paid for but I was so tired of dealing with the customer representatives that I paid the fee. Sprint charges a month in advance so be mindful of what they are charging you and when it is being charged. I learned to always have an only representative to  assist so you can receive the transcripts and also take screenshots of the conversation, record if necessary. Sprint customer service representatives do not check previous conversations before assisting customers. I‚Äôm not happy with sprint and now that my phone is paid for I‚Äôm considering switching carriers.	negative
1874	491126018	utility	1	I have called every month to have my bill adjusted. I joined sprint while the promotion was get an iPhone X for $20 a month. For this to happen Sprint has to credit my bill $20 a month per phone line. I have 4 phoneS. Every month Sprint only gives me credit for 2 of the phones. Last month after we calling in for three months in a row. I decided to finally trust and allow them to automatically take the funds withdrawn from my checking account to receive a $5 credit for each phone. Saving me another $20 a month. Because I did this I was charged $60 that Was automatically drafted from my account. This month again they charged me full price rent for the two phones that I am to have the 2 $20 credits for. I just spoke to them again. We have been customers for 5 months now and I feel forced to stay with Sprint. The service is awful. We have dropped calls every day. And the data is horrible and because Sprint has a map that says we are in a coverage area they will not help us. I feel like a gun is being held to my head.	positive
1875	491126018	utility	1	I bought a new phone at the Sprint store and returned my old phone. First of all the person at the sprint store told me I could get an offer I brought in as long as I purchased $100 in accessories. No where in the offer did it say that. But I went ahead and agreed to purchase the accessories. When I got my bill I found out that they had charged me for insurance that I did not request and I also got charged for the device they claimed I had not returned. After 1 1/2 hours of being in an online chat with 3 different reps. I got the issue resolved. This was after the first one told me after 20 minutes of waiting that their system was down and to check back in 30-40 minutes. The second one disconnected out chat suddenly and so did the third one. The only way I found out that it was resolved was because I signed back on to my sprint account to see if I could get a customer service number and saw that the bill has been adjusted. Very poor service.  I may start looking for another carrier.	negative
1876	491126018	utility	1	I drive a long distance to work and most of the way I get little to no service. I switch from Verizon to Sprint because I was promised better service and better price and I realized on my first bill that I made a grave mistake. Not only the service was bad but I found out about the hidden fees. Almost 3 three years later I decided to cancel my account and I found out that I had to still pay for my phone if I wanted to keep it because what I as initially promised, was that I would pay for my phone for two years and it was mine. Almost two months after my cancelation they are still changing (full price for two line) because because canceling my line is not enough, I have to call to cancel my automatic payment as well. Reading all the review here, I realized that I‚Äôm not the only one. Too bad I can‚Äôt give negative stars!! Costumer service acts like you are a idiot and don‚Äôt know anything ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm the expert about your bill, let me tell you why you are wrong‚Äù (this is what they told me).	negative
1877	491126018	utility	4	"It‚Äôs far from perfect but I switched over after being with AT&T for over a decade. AT&T seemed to have a small (to the point of being negligible) advantage when it comes to signal strength but it‚Äôs barely noticeable. For the better price and the exceedingly better customer care, my only regret is that I didn‚Äôt ditch AT&T way way sooner. AT&T is a thoroughly crooked company that ashamedly lies to and steals from its customers. 

So, comparing the experience between my current service from Sprint and my past experiences dealing with AT&T (like the way they format their billing statements statements to be practically impossible to decipher) has given me an appreciation for Sprints superior customer care and less aggressive practice of adding fraudulent fees on top of whatever the agreed upon monthly service plan was supposed to be."	positive
1878	491126018	utility	1	I just paid an extra $200 something on my phone bill because the company wants to charge me for a phone I had previously bought out in the store, even though I‚Äôve had the receipt for it and everything. After contacting the company on numerous occasions and even going back to the store and having them tell me there was nothing they can do about it, except for me to call over the phone or go to the corporate store, I had to pay my bill because I need my phone for work. Even after I paid my actual bill last month they still decided to shut my service off and usually I‚Äôm very patient with things and never leave such long reviews, but this was all just ridiculous and people need to know how terrible they are with dealing with such a thing. I will never be recommending this company to anyone ever and I‚Äôm definitely switching over after my contract is complete. The only positive thing I have to say is that all of the people that did help were friendly.	positive

Nope that‚Äôs not the case ever-time I call is like I get spin around the rep tells me reset this and reset that, keeps me !!! on the phone for and hour an half with out any positive results... so when the opportunity comes around I will have to cancel sprint,  I can‚Äôt speak positive about the company any more cause sprint has changed a lot throughout the years with customer support and service, it is very sad that no one cares about their customers in sprint anymore!!!!	positive
1880	491126018	utility	1	Actually beyond horrible! Called to unlock my fathers phone. Was transferred 3 times. Was then told that we had to pay the fair market price for the phone. Was transferred again to pay but I was transferred to Apple and the phone is a Galaxy S5. So the next day I went to a Sprint store and paid off the phone but since the store doesn‚Äôt do unlock I had to call again. I was told that the phone would be unlocked within 72 hours. It wasn‚Äôt. I called again and was told that my unlock request was made too soon after the payment so the unlock request was denied. I was told again that everything was now OK and the phone would be unlocked within 72 hours. Last night I received an email stating that the phone could not be unlocked because there is a balance due. The account is on auto pay and has been for years so any balance is always paid on time. I just authorized an early payment but now I have to call again to request the unlock. Horrible, horrible, horrible!!!!	negative

When you call you get transferred around and spend 2 hours minimum on the phone listening to how they will fix things but fail to do so. I have not had good audio service on any of our lines this entire year and have not only complained, hours on the phone, in store, even another brand new phone and being sent to the apple store an hour away. Sprint store told me they don‚Äôt know how to work with apple phones. This was the repair store. The service quality is horrible in fort Myers everywhere. I have done all they asked and it took 6 months to finally get their magic box. I have been lied to by their employees and they never follow up as promised. My phone cuts out and my family can only hear every other word.  This company is a joke and I was promised  a big discount on my very high bill and not one penny removed.

I will be canceling my service within the next month. The give me a reminder that my bill due date is coming up. Do they say the date? No! Then the due date comes and goes, with out another word from them... and I‚Äôm stuck paying an extra $36 for a late fee...for the past several months! If your stupid company was trying to be helpful, why not remind me of the date you jackasses. Telling me ‚Äúit‚Äôs coming up‚Äù is stupid. I know it‚Äôs coming up, the end of the month is too. I‚Äôm so sick of the app that does nothing good except TAKE YOUR MONEY! Customer service is always experiencing technical difficulties, the live chat bull crap has never worked. They‚Äôre always too busy, try again later. Later? I‚Äôm gonna make my business easier than ever for you to handle Sprint, I‚Äôm taking my money elsewhere! Kiss my *%!!  Thank you.	negative

I‚Äôve traveled some & granted no network is perfect and obviously Sprint is no different. But I can drive to northern NJ with no drop calls. Center of PA definitely has a lot of 3G spots & a few extended areas. I switched to Sprint from T-Mobile because I was tired of T-Mobiles poor calling service and (in my experience) even spottier coverage. Since switching I drop calls a lot less & my bill is the just about the same each month (another reason I left T-Mobile) the app is simple and easy enough to navigate and use. Just be sure to check their coverage before switching. I find their coverage map is fairly accurate.	positive

Not sure why I wouldn‚Äôt receive the message.  I went into the ap and made and updated the credit card information and paid the bill.  I hope I don‚Äôt get charged a over due fee.

1886	491126018	utility	4	I still can‚Äôt believe that Sprint has a hard time making and receiving Conference calls. Sure, you can click over to the other line. But you can‚Äôt separate the calls without hanging up on Both parties in order to speak to one person privately. Even when you click to answer your other line while currently on the phone, it would still show you have two parties in the phone after one caller hung up. Tmobile, AT&T and Verizon has that feature to separate two way calls. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the point of Sprint not having it by now. It may sound petty, but I like to make conference calls with the ability to separate or drop the calls with ease. Sprint has too much History in the phone company to be Missing Features! Great Family Plan Prices Though. Fix it Jesus!	positive
1887	491126018	utility	5	I‚Äôve been with sprint for a few years now, the service is good but being able to actively talk on the phone and not being able to receive or output any data (besides basic text) is a bit odd considering most other providers allow this ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. The pricing could be a little more affordable for account owners. For two lines it cost me around $150 a month. For unlimited Text, Data and Call. Which in consideration that‚Äôs the going rate. So it‚Äôs not just Sprint. The range of service isn‚Äôt the best, but tolerable. I‚Äôve stuck with spring mainly due to the fact that the customer service surpasses any other experience I‚Äôve personally had with other service providers. Along with in store service.	positive

Firstly, I have a plan with just one line and the seller said that I was going to pay $90/month and I agreed. But in my first bill I received about $310 and I went to the store and the same seller told me that he wasn‚Äôt understanding why I received that bill, but it was my first month in here and I needed my phone bc I needed to talk to my family. Anyways, I paid that money and the seller(he was the manager) he said that I was gonna pay just $90/month. But how I hoped, nothing changed and I received about $200 on the second month. I thought that they were going to refund me bc I paid a lot of extra on the first month. And the same seller was always saying ‚Äúidk what‚Äôs happening!‚Äù And I needed to contact sprint by Facebook and I talked to a bunch of different ppl and nothing was changed so far.

Here‚Äôs another one star review to accompany all the others, because a bunch of idiots can‚Äôt figure out how to keep up support for people‚Äôs phone accounts.

The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it 5 stars is because the chat option within the app is of poor quality. When I chat on the actual website I am connected with representatives that are professional and literate, and whom seem to follow a script. They are also professional and courteous. The last two times I‚Äôve connected to the chat via the Sprint app, the representatives I spoke with had grammatical errors in their chats and did not have any customer service etiquette. When I asked for the chat transcript to me emailed to me for my records, the agent told me to screenshot the chat. Other than that the app is easy to use.	positive

Just became a new customer, and am ver dissatisfied with the phone support.  Instead of listening and responding with possible solutions, the representatives want to go through their entire ‚Äúscript‚Äù before putting you left for extended periods fo time, and then transferring you to someone else, who then asks for all of you personal information (again), only to read the same list of questions the previous person asked. At the end of the call, you are no further than when you started, except 2-3 hours older.

The representatives, are not native English speakers, and have such poor diction and understanding of the language that they can barely communicate, and definitely do not comprehend.

Pathetic service for a company supposedly base in Germany.
Hoping that the US Department of Justice does not approve the merger with sprint and TMobile, as that would just reinforce their bad behavior.  Best thing would be for them to lose enough customers to impact their business model and profit margin, since money is the only thing that gets their attention.

1893	491126018	utility	1	Will be changing carriers when my contract is up. There customer service is horrible and there service is deceiving. I had a sales rep. Up sale me on an item she claimed was completely FREE. After three months I started getting charged. I then got on the phone with customer service to TRY and figure it out. Each month for the next three months I continued to get charged, finally customer service told me i needed to cancel the service within the thirty day period. Let me remind you that it was a device I didn‚Äôt want or need and only took it after the sales rep insisted it was free. It will now cost me an early cancellation fee that is more than just continuing to pay the service. I STILL TO THIS DAY HAVE NOT USED THE DEVICE!!! Sprint claims it was my fault for not canceling in the first thirty days, which is the deceiving part because I did even start getting charged for ninety days. Needless to say I WILL be changing service providers when my contract is up.	negative
1894	491126018	utility	5	"So update on the whole experience with sprint. I‚Äôve had the service now for about 2 weeks and I‚Äôve gotta say I‚Äôm not to impressed with the service. I‚Äôm right in the middle of town and the quality of the calls is really bad. Also of course no one mentioned that with sprint you can not use the internet while on a call.. so for as much as I‚Äôm paying for the phone every month plus the service I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs really worth the money. I think that it was pretty shady to let me sign up for the lease without even mentioning that oh by the way you can‚Äôt even use the internet if your on the phone. 

So far the experience has been great! Shashonna and Jesus helped me with (MOST) of my experience although ALL of the associates in the store did actually help me with one thing or another. 

   They were all very kind and quick to answer any questions I had, and in fact even did everything in their power to help me get every possible perk being currently offered.

My service is absolutely terrible, I can‚Äôt even get a signal at my work, on the road to work, and if I head into Chicago, forget about it. I went several times to the sprint store, and they offered me some booster box that looked like a window air conditioner and said that I could connect to that while at work to make my signal better.....great, but what about everywhere else? 

The employees at the store I went to promised that I would be reimbursed for changing from Verizon (worst decision ever if I have made that perfectly clear already), I wasn‚Äôt reimbursed at all. They promised two tickets from ticket master as part of the sign up promo, never got them. Best thing ever, they told me that yes, Verizon was a lot more expensive and that‚Äôs why you get better service. Sadly, that only aggravated me more. I would gladly pay their expensive cost for a phone that is actually reliable.

When they did that 100% satisfaction guarantee, I called to see if I could get out of my contract because of all the issues I have been having, and they said no, it was only for new customers.

Each time speaking to a representative it was difficult as each person is hard to understand and they ask three to four times what you are calling about. The last time I called I was having the sprint complete removed from the newest line that I recently added and after telling her 3 times the line I wanted it removed she then started to remove on the one I wanted it on. Ugh frustrating!!!!!!  When I set the line up I never wanted the sprint complete on that phone.

You can pay your bill, view your bill including breakdown of charges, set up auto pay, change your payment info., view your bill, view how much data you‚Äôve used/have left and even see exactly where your data was used....it‚Äôs broken down into percents in 10 different categories(internet, apps, chat, navigation, video, messaging, audio, cloud, downloads and gaming). The only thing I dislike is that it‚Äôs not usually accurate as it always shows me having some low percent usage for gaming when I haven‚Äôt touched a game.  What I also like a lot is that you can change your plan as needed as far as how many GB you need each month. I also like the Verizon up feature:  once you have accumulated enough money thru payments each month (I think it‚Äôs like $ 300 dollars), you can apply $ 5 dollars towards different things like an extra GB of data, gift cards, or ‚Äúdevice dollars‚Äù where the money accumulates and you can use it in the future to apply to a new device.  It‚Äôs free money!  The last feature I love is being able to ask questions at any time about anything:  Technical questions about your phone, your bill or anything you can think of really.

The best they can do is give me an additional $25 credit.   I said I wasn‚Äôt satisfied but that was the best they could do.  I also noticed that the mobile protection was no longer on my phone when I reviewed my bill.   I have had mobile protection on this phone for many years.   She said she couldn‚Äôt add it back because it was past the 30 days from activation date of 10/25. She said I could contact Assurion directly to have the protection added back.  I called Assurion and they also refused to have the protection added because they adhere to the 30 day rule also.   I asked if there was a way to escalate and plead my case since I have been a good customer and it wasn‚Äôt that far passed the 30 days.   I was told sorry, there is nothing they can do.

What they neglected to tell me was that they would require me to have a two year contract plan for a new number and data plan. My intent in buying the iPad was to FaceTime with my Grandchildren. I contacted customer service and although they were very helpful they could not do anything about the two year contract. In addition to purchasing a new phone, I also bought an Otter case, protective screen and a quick charger. I was promised that I would receive those items excluding the phone in two days. I was advised that I would need to be there to sign for the items. Well, they never arrived and I wasted an entire day waiting. The items were delivered on the next day and left at my door. No one signed for them. Upon opening the box I was surprised to find a Samsung quick charger. The directions clearly state that this charger can only be compatible with a Samsung product. When I contacted customer service they laughed and said an iPhone will not work with that charger. I said, ‚Äúyou people sent it to me after purchasing an iPhone‚Äù. I reordered another quick charger and it came two days later. I‚Äôm completely disappointed and more than likely switching to another carrier.

The quality of customer service has declined in recent years as customer base expanded, however I have found if you have the patience to call back when service has been unacceptable, odds are decent that you will receive better service on the second call (sometimes a third try is required). 

I have stayed for over 10 years because my personal experience with Sprint was worse and AT&T I have found to be less than honest (my personal opinion) in their practices based on my personal experience with home services. AT&T's MO with me has always been to apologize that I was misled yet refuse to take financial responsibility for the misleading representation or relieve me of the resulting loss. 

Historically I do my upgrades between Black Friday & Christmas and Verizon has had attractive promotions in that timeframe.  However I am disappointed in Verizon's holiday promotions for the iPhone so far this year. Hope they get better. The up to $300 off they advertise is NOT a discount because they require you trade-in your current phone. You can sell your phone on any number of sites, Verizon is at best paying what you are owed for your phone, so no discount. I have never noticed this kind of deception (my personal opinion) in Verizon advertising/ promotions before. Trust it won't be a pattern"	positive

But the real reason I‚Äôm writing this review is to let anyone that will take the time to read this know that some big corporations really do care about their customers.  I just received an email from Verizon letting me know that I was approaching my data limit.  They didn‚Äôt have to do that, they could have said nothing and charged me for my overage. But instead they showed me options to upgrade my plan at a reduced price.  I took them up on their offer and received an additional 4 gigs of data immediately.

Many large multinational corporations really don‚Äôt care about customer support and just pay you lip service to keep taking your hard earned money.  Verizon is not one of those companies.  I would not have stayed with them for 19 years if I thought otherwise.

Stick with what works, the grass may look greener on the other side, but that only lasts until the promotion ends.  This is an honest review and I have not been compensated to write this review"	positive

First it wouldn‚Äôt accept my password that I KNOW I had on the account, then it said that after too many attempts I was locked out, I went through the prompts of resetting my password following the password guidelines and hit a screen that suggest the password is NOT reset (red boxes around the new password I tried to use that followed the password guideline) without any other insight on why it didn‚Äôt work. I then tried to talk to your chat bot, which put me into an endless circle of a conversation about ‚Äòhow to reset a password‚Äô, it clearly didn‚Äôt understand that I had already attempted that.

Guess you know it‚Äôs secure when even an experienced wireless consultant has a hard time accessing their own account. The general public can barely remember their own simple passwords, don‚Äôt make them jump through ten thousand hoops just to find a password they‚Äôre not even going to remember. I could go on, but my point is that if you‚Äôre going to encourage customers to utilize the app to manage your account at least make it easier for them.

If I had one I didn‚Äôt have a clue what it was.  So I clicked ‚ÄúForgot my PIN‚Äù, the closest option to ‚ÄúI never had one‚Äù.  It said to enter my mobile phone number and a temporary PIN would be sent to it.  I never got it.  Tried a few times then the app said there was a problem, try back later.  Later was quite a bit later.  Trying to register with app went nowhere so I tried by web, which was very similar.  Finally I called the help number and waited for a long time.  Got a very nice and helpful lady to walk me through the process.  It took a while, explaining the long wait time.  The big secret seemed to be, make up a PIN.  Maybe that worked because she did something at her end, I think that must have the case since I had to tell her what it was.  Anyway I finally got registered (make up a password and have it ready), and was able to pay my bill.  I think the main problem is there is no clue where you should have gotten the PIN needed to register.  Or that you end up making one up.  This was probably the most confusing registration I ever did.  Just a bit of added help in the app could have avoided the problem.	positive

We were given a price for what our bill would be once the promotion kicked in.  They also told me that it might take a cycle or two for the credit to show up. 
After a couple of months I went back to the store.  They weren't sure why the credit had not come off but just asked me to be patient.  The same thing the next month.
I gave up on the store and called Verizon directly, which obviously I should have done from the beginning!!! Now they tell me that the promotion was only good if you have the unlimited data plan.  They were all too happy to switch me to the unlimited plan so they could give me the promotion and were somehow surprised that I didn't want to pay an extra $57 a month to get the $30 promotion.

I do not patronize any company with sorry customer service, no matter how much I would save. You get what you pay for at Verizon. Anytime I have had to call them on a problem it was usually solved during the first phone call or I got a return call soon after. I have NEVER had a problem that was ignored or

However, the Verizon backend systems and applications are horrible and have made my life sometimes a living hell. Customer service is top-notch, they have resolved many problems, but they are not always able to override or correct the horrible system issues. For example, auto-pay has been working for months, but decided not to work today, even though I have plenty of money in my account and I was able to make a manual payment using the same payment method. Ugh!!

The app has definitely gotten better over the years, but isn‚Äôt perfected yet. It is nice to view and manage my account, and all lines on the family account. My corporate discount does not show up when shopping for accessories, and there is no better selection in the app than in the Verizon store near my house.

1/. It always says that I have a new message that one of my lines is ready for an upgrade (even after clearing it out more times than I have phones). This just makes me ignore messages since it makes the red dot always on with no new info thus defeating the very purpose of the dot which is that there is a new message - yet there isn‚Äôt!! That is usually called a lie. It can be a mistake for a while but to leave the mistake unfixed for so long starts to turn it into something else. 
2./ The (left of iPhone home screen) widget has recently started to get disconnected from the app. It says to open the app to reconnect but that does not happen. When I log into the account on the app then the widget temporarily updates but promptly disconnects again as soon as the app is closed.

I thought everything was taken care, until going to pay my bill. Next bill will be $120. The reason I switched was because my payment would be below my personal budget toward a phone.

The App is great! I always use the app to check data, future and current bills, past bills, and pretty much any other information I need. One of the best things about the verizon app is the chat line. I talk with them any time I need them and the customer service is comparable to Chick Fil A, and sometimes better, with the exception of saving calico cats from burning trees in the mountains of west Africa (I like chick fil a üòâ). But certainly, if you want to stay up on how much data you are using (it can be added to your news feed in iPhone) and you want to stay aware of your account and pay your bills on time, certainly download the app. Verizon is the best phone company, hands down.

Finally, in March, I was told about the Go Unlimited 55 plus loyalty program!  Finally, a solution.

4 stars rating is for two reasons: 1) because I‚Äôd like to see more detailed device specs and a device comparison capability within the Shop section instead of going into the ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô or ‚Äòpurchase‚Äô processes - or out to the web. And 2) I‚Äôm already a loyal customer, you don‚Äôt have to ‚Äòsell‚Äô me. Everything seems a beautiful sales gimmick outside of the administrative section of billing. That makes me wary of clicking one tab too many and accidentally purchasing something. Serve me instead with detailed device comparisons, instructional links and how to videos that tell us how to utilize and maximize our experiences with these incredible technological tools. 

This is a beautifully functional app that has greatly improved over the last couple years. Kudos to the entire development team."	positive

And also everyone I talk to says about the same thing, I live about 3 miles straight threw from the tower and even when I‚Äôm within a 1/4 a mile it drops calls, and yes I have went threw all the phone checks with service technicians and it‚Äôs always the same assumption it‚Äôs my phone but never is after all the bs you go threw. And they always say well Verizon  doesn‚Äôt have any plans for any fix, or we can let you out of your contract, but the only problem with that is your the only show around. And I‚Äôm paying over $200 + a month for poor service, and it‚Äôs like Verizon just doesn‚Äôt care. I just don‚Äôt understand why the service was good before the spring of this year !!!	positive

I‚Äôd like to have Verizon Act As One Entity, Considering it really is. Every company has different departments. I I don‚Äôt know any companies with the same name act as if they can‚Äôt facilitate a customer service request. For instance I‚Äôve been paying for a land line at my house for at least 6 months that don‚Äôt even work. My modem keeps shutting itself down and even though I should be on my wi fi it constantly fails so hence my data is used up. My cell phone and every cell phone I get is choppy like I have a plate in my head? Every one of them, people can‚Äôt hear me but I can hear them. All they hear is a choooy in and out version of what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôve been paying for HD service at home with my Fios and don‚Äôt have a HD box, despite going to the Fios store with my receiver to swap it out, they could not accommodate and told me to do it on line? I pay yous way to much money every month for this customer service to be so shorty. Give me an agent that knows your business not just one portion of it so I can get this remediated please.	positive

I‚Äôve been with Verizon for Five years. I have always had the very best call quality. I called the other day, I had literally a Four hour conversation with a very nice lady. We talked about a lot of things. But what I called in for she did perfectly. She even offered hand me over to a specialist in that area I was needing help in. But, honestly she should have been a specialist in every area based on how much she knew. She loves her job and it shows. 

I have unlimited data/text/call, it never lets me down even when I‚Äôm up in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

I have the iPhone X, and I have an iPhone 7 +, soon to be another X. This iPhone X is one of the best phones I‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôve had every high end phone too. Verizon made sure I got it in two days. My insurance on it is great. If I accidentally drop it then they‚Äôll come out to my home and replace the screen for 49$. I had AT&T and I can‚Äôt say anything bad about them because they are very loyal to their long term customers just like Verizon. But their service isn‚Äôt everywhere like Verizon‚Äôs. Their data isn‚Äôt as fast as Verizon‚Äôs either. But they‚Äôre a good company. I just wanted Verizon because I travel a lot and I need great service in areas that AT&T doesn‚Äôt cover. No regrets in anything I‚Äôve changed in service providers. I also have all my phones and never traded in any of them cause I‚Äôve never needed the money. Thank you Verizon. You‚Äôre the best in my opinion anyways.

The customer service rep somehow managed to CANCEL my existing plan that is no longer offered (unlimited data) while setting up the hotspot. I did not figure out the issue until I received multiple notifications that I had a data overage alert. Called multiple times. Talked to 2 different reps. Both were positive that I was on a 4gb plan and that I should upgrade to save myself money. I proceeded to correct them and pointed out that they should look at my previous bills. Averaging 50+ GB/monthly. I then asked for them to look at the call log. It should show in their history which rep made the switch to my plan and to see that it was not ‚Äúauthorized‚Äù by the customer. After 40 minutes on the phone they said that they would have to send a request to corporate for ‚Äúfuture tickets‚Äù and wait for a response. This could easily end my relationship with Verizon if this is not corrected. I will also cancel the other lines I‚Äôm associated with (spouses, work). What a hassle to h e to deal with on Christmas. Thanks Verizon.	positive

This was a horrible company with poor service and products. Finally Verizon bought them up and Wow, what an improvement. Great service and products, very friendly staff. However the service has gone down over the last 5 years, poor cellphone signals , dropped calls, delayed messages, etc. I even spoken with support staff who were rude, and not helpful. Needless to say I‚Äôm shopping for a new carrier. Apparently 17 years of customer loyalty means nothing to a big company like Verizon. As the saying goes, ‚Äúthe bigger you are the harder you fall.‚Äù I‚Äôm seeking another small company like Cellular One who cared about their customers and wants to stay in business. Growth can be a good thing for business investors, but typically is poorly managed and the fallout from it gets dumped onto the customers. When companies go back to being self-sufficient and managing their own growth versus becoming a publicly traded, then service will become the norm and product quality will increase. Sorry Verizon, but you‚Äôve gotten too big for your britches.

We didn‚Äôt want to renew a plan we‚Äôve been on for 1 year and we bought the phones at the Apple store. So what‚Äôs this $100 charge? I‚Äôd know if I could get the app to work. When I found the ‚Äúview bill details‚Äù which wasn‚Äôt easy it asked me to log on, but it‚Äôs already got my name listed on the page header? Okay so I try to log on, not positive I remember my password from their website and since it didn‚Äôt ask me to create one for the app I try what I think the password should be and no surprise it was incorrect. The interesting part is after one try I‚Äôm locked out and don‚Äôt see a way to recover my password. The kicker is that message says I tried to enter the incorrect password 5 times. Did I mention I only typed it once? As if that weren‚Äôt enough there‚Äôs a page where you can set payments options. My bill is not due until January 7, but I could only pick today‚Äôs date. So much for autopay Verizon! Don‚Äôt get this app! It wasted far too much of my time for zero benefit. I thought technology was supposed to make my life easier and more efficient.	positive

1936	416023011	utility	1	This app used to work great on my iPhone 6 running the most current iOS. About 6 months ago it stopped opening. When I try to open the app it never goes to a screen to enter a user name or pw. It just starts ‚Äúspinning‚Äù and after a while gives an error saying ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre sorry. It looks like we are having trouble connecting. Check your connection and try again.‚Äù  The only option is a button to try again which gives the same result. I tried multiple times to delete and reload the app with no change. I recently spent an hour on the phone with a very nice lady who tried everything without success to resolve the problem. She finally asked me to delete the app again. Then she deleted my app account on her end and asked me to wait a day or two for everything to clear before reloading the app. I did so with exactly the same result when I loaded and set up the app. Earlier this month I upgraded to iPhone XR and the app does the same thing. I have a friend with Samsung Galaxy S9+ that also does the same thing. I can go to a web browser, log in to My Verizon and access everything fine. Makes no sense why the app fails. Very frustrating.	negative
1937	416023011	utility	2	"As is typical with Verizon, advertising is front and center on this app and there‚Äôs no obvious way to disable it. Worse, the app _only_ works on the Verizon network. If you want to manage Verizon accounts from your AT&T phone, you‚Äôre out of luck and have to use their website.

The app itself does most of what you would expect. You can pay your bill, see data usage, etc. If you‚Äôve decided to change how your account is managed, you have to call customer support. Verizon has a notion of an account owner that‚Äôs tied to a line number. If you‚Äôve ported a number and want that number to be the account owner, you‚Äôre in for a confusing time. The app simply doesn‚Äôt know how to handle this. Customer support can fix this by resetting account ownership. Lastly, the app frequently hangs with a blue spinning ring of patience, but restarting seems to fix it.

If you don‚Äôt mind in your face advertising, only fall into the expected usage pattern by Verizon, and restarting the app frequently doesn‚Äôt faze you, this app is more than adequate. For me, it‚Äôs consistently aggravating. Can you hear me now? Good!"	positive

To the development team, I‚Äôm sure you read this review and I hope you can remedy this. This app needs to be easier to use to get in contact with someone from customer service. I have never been able to reach someone to chat with on the app (I‚Äôve tried over 5 times). I usually wait about 30 mins and give up because I assume the app wasn‚Äôt implemented correctly. After I give up, I call the general customer service line and get put on hold and nothing gets finished. The app needs to bridge this and make the customer service experience better. Maybe with an implementation of reviewing the customer service received and a record of who was helping (badge # or something for the Verizon rep). These representatives need to be held accountable for not effectively solving issues and just putting people on hold until they give up. I will update this review if this gets remedied."	positive

Get more data now!‚Äù  I  have spent a very large amount of time calling in or doing a live chat to confirm that I am not out of data, yet the rep can‚Äôt see the inaccurate info on the app and they tell me to not worry. Once I was even transferred to technical support and was told it was just a glitch and to not worry about it. Once I was told to just continue checking every day as the app would eventually refresh and update, once I was told to wait until the end of my billing cycle as data would replenish at that point, and most recently I was told to try uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I have had to do that twice in the last week. There are clearly problems with your app. It is very time consuming. This glitch occurred on our family vacation when we needed data for mapping. And right now, I have a child in a foreign country for a college seminar and he absolutely needs data for academic purposes, to navigate his surroundings and for safety. The unreliability of the app is time consuming and disconcerting.	positive

I had to do two phone unlimited (which isn‚Äôt fair cause one is flip phone and they have no intentions on using data) the representative that helped me was extremely nice and I was comfortable. But I got home and not much service I went from 4g to maybe one bar. That Saturday 8th February I talked to another extremely helpful and nice representative again and she helped as much as she could we ended up having to go to Bossier City (40 miles away) and get a new sims card and update my phone at the Verizon store.   So I had to delete all kinds of things to be able to update my phone (including pictures of grand babies)  the Verizon store people were very nice     I got a text late last saying my data was running out 5g.

1941	416023011	utility	3	Impartial and only loyal for convenience of getting paid from the customer. I understand that it's a business but throttling a customers speeds when they pay for unlimited is low. When I moved to Tulsa one of the service reps at a store (who was later fired for ethical reasons but not related to my issue) did things to my account that maximized the kickbacks he would receive (to include a line I didn't need or have a phone for). Luckily, after a year went by I was wanting to see what upgrades may be feasible and to get rid of my wifi-hotspot (to include getting removed from my account). Just so happens the regional VP was doing inventory at that store and decided to help me. She corrected my account issues. If the little guy who made those changes was there anymore, I believe he would have been fired. I am also impartial and would love a reason to be loyal other than complacent comfort, and have a reason to feel otherwise but I have not had any company give me reason to be excited about their service in a long time.	positive

Bad enough they got me to sign away my unlimited data years ago, this time it was adding a new phone and IÔ∏è pad for free and saving 150m a month. Needless to say none of the magic happened. Customer service for hours asked for supervisor was told no one there expect a call in 24-48 hours , you guessed it no call. What makes it bad is my account has been active for over 30 years had over 10 devices spending 350 a month on fios and 650 on cell phones for family. That 12,000 a year to treated like crap . The first thing  , cancelled three devices,  will migrate kids to orher companies of their choice, will remove fios next and use smart TVs or Apple TV with a different provider. Enough is enough.

1943	416023011	utility	1	I‚Äôve recently had issues with not receiving my carryover data. I‚Äôve had lengthy conversations with Support over the phone and via chat. I keep losing unused data every month, and I think it has to do with the app. Every time I need to upgrade my data plan, it gives me an option of which billing cycle to apply the data to. I always select the current one because that‚Äôs when I need the data. Not the following month. What leaves me suspicious is a rep told me over the phone that the new data plan is backdated. That that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done. This doesn‚Äôt make sense when the app and website allow you to options. Furthermore, the rep said that the new plan is backdated to the 2 months before, so then that carryover data is being applied to the last month, which is why it wasn‚Äôt applied to the current (June). Why would I add data to a month that is already over??! This rep was so confusing. He credited me extra data, but only because he wanted to end the conversation. Are they going to do this every time they steal my leftover data?? I‚Äôm going to look into switching carriers.	negative
1944	416023011	utility	1	Awful service, plans, rates, support, and devices. I purchased three new Apple devices, NONE work correctly with the service. Constant lag and poor connection. (The iPad cannot even connect to cellular and after several calls they never completed a solution.) I don‚Äôt know which is worse, Verizon or Apple. I came off of a prepaid service and ZTE so you‚Äôd assume I would be thrilled. I feel like I‚Äôve been scammed after drinking Verizon‚Äôs cool aid. The devices totaled over $2600, the plan/devices costs  $250 per month. I had better service and connection with Metro, no joke. My iPhone is a higher memory option and isn‚Äôt even close to being full, and Siri has been getting worse over time along with the overall performance of the device. It‚Äôs only 6mo old. My bill is over doubled and my daughter runs out of data in a week. We get less for more $. I live in two major cities and in my homes I get around 1-2 bars in a stand alone house with no trees or tall buildings. Again, Metro has full bars and lightning fast internet, and the call quality is better. Completely unsatisfied.	negative
1945	416023011	utility	3	Most everything you can do in it is simple & straightforward. For that, it gets Hogg marks. However, I feel it REALLY falls down in helping you manage your bill. I think it has a way to sign up for text notifications, but the app itself should alert you when it‚Äôs due. And I‚Äôm pretty sure the text notifications happen like 10 days out - not very practical for people that unfortunately have to live closer to paycheck-to-paycheck. Would be great if the app popped a notification itself to tell/remind you to pay within, say, 2 or 3 days of payment being due. Because I‚Äôm fairly sure the next text notification you get is when your next bill cuts 4-5 days after your due date. And by that time, you have a late fee, and something that potentially affects your credit rating. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I know I‚Äôm responsible for my finances. All I‚Äôm saying is that the app could be so much more helpful/useful with a really simple change/update.	positive

Hey wyd always accommodated my family whenever we had a problem up h til recently. My family & I went into a Verizon wireless store to upgrade their phones since they were advertising a great PROMO deal. They really need to inform & train all their employees better! This guy who helped us had NO idea what he was doing! So many add ons, an added line without mentioning it. Once the damage was done I got the bill a month later & was so confused as to why it was so much! So the first two months or so they fixed our bill. But then the bill got higher & higher without us making any changes. So I called a few days ago & find out we weren‚Äôt even eligible for the promo upgrade deal we thought we got! Did Verizon accommodate? NO. They basically said it was my fault the bill went up & that I had to pay for THEIR employees mistakes! So I left it & paid it off anyway.

Well my mother in law lives with us and she updated her device to the new iPhone X and she still constantly drops calls, as do my and my wife.

So I continued to use the MyTWC app for that purpose. As a matter of fact, I used the MyTWC app about 3 days ago. Now today, I‚Äôm told that I have messages on my phone, so I go to check them from my app to clear it out because I know it‚Äôs mostly spam calls that are too stupid to recognize a voicemail system. But lo and behold the MyTWC app won‚Äôt login, it just keeps referring me to the MySPECTRUM app which still doesn‚Äôt allow me to access my voicemail. Other than checking my voicemail, bill amount or equipment status when I see a issue, the app is worthless to me. You can‚Äôt schedule or change the scheduled time of a repair, and I can‚Äôt check my voicemail without dialing into the system and punching in a bunch of numbers. The older MyTWC app was so much better! Either fix the new app so that it‚Äôs comparable, or allow people to continue using the older app. I kinda wanted to give it a 1 star because of what it can‚Äôt do, but decided to give it two stars because of what it can.

I was going to try logging out and back in but, guess what?  That isn‚Äôt an option (what moron decided that wouldn‚Äôt be necessary?)...once again I ignore the email thinking the ‚Äòclick here to pay‚Äô link was probably a scam, and the verified account with their app shows $0.  Finally, someone called.  I explained that the app showed zero owed, I had previously made a payment 3-4x the monthly charge and should hold a positive balance.  I was told to use the website and not the app and there it was, -$198.  I immediately paid it and wrote this review.  What a dumb fxxking app that doesn‚Äôt tie to your account, doesn‚Äôt give proper account information, and still requires website login since it apparently only provides information from when you installed the app.  Don‚Äôt trust it.

I called Spectrum and 1.5 hours later after speaking to 4 different representatives, I was told that there is nothing that Spectrum can do. I was advised to call my bank to stop the payment (in my own time, dime, and energy). Furthermore, representatives were rude and didn't seem to care about my concerns at all.

I have two kids with autism that have a routine of watching online programming every day.  Yet when the service gets interrupted because Spectrum decided to disconnect the signal my wife and I have to calm our kids which is not easy due to their condition.  I have had accounting issues in the past where they made error and we fixed them.  However even though we have a receipt stating that payment was made they will not honor that.

I don‚Äôt think so or they would have fixed some things by now. They don‚Äôt show upcoming service appointments nor can I get through to them from calling on my cell from a hospital to cancel and reschedule. What is up with that. I‚Äôm calling from my cell inside a hospital and they keep calling me back on my home phone. Not only that I insist on paying my bill immediately and every time I pay what I paid the month before ahead of my bill I always end up having to pay an additional 46 cents. Why did the powers that be decide their Spectrum app was far superior to Time Warner?  They bought Time Warner because they wanted to be #1. Why didn‚Äôt they convert Charter to TWC. That would have been the smart way seems as how TWC is far superior to Charter and much, much bigger. Please make your app comparable to what you decided to replace. I know you really don‚Äôt care what your customers think of you but please maybe you should listen to us for a change.	positive

It would show the name of the caller and time of call, (just as it shows up on ur TV, if you have turned on ur called ID in settings on ur remote). If there was a voicemail, there was notification would pop up as well.  I‚Äôd tap on the notification on my iPhone, and it would take me directly to the TWC app and I could listen to the voicemail.      I could even send that VM to my email if I wanted to keep it or forward to a family member so they could listen to it. 

Why is this not available?  And my mobile service is thru AT&T, not Spectrum. So that is not an excuse.  After the price jump on our bundle of services, and losing channels we had for years, that are no longer in our tier unless we pay extra, we are looking into ‚Äúcutting the cord‚Äù and getting our services elsewhere.

Subsequently, I made a payment. When I discovered I made two payments for the same billing period I contacted spectrum as my bank cannot stop a pending transaction. Spectrum, rather the csr Stephanie K. stated that they could not stop a pending transaction too. I asked if I could receive a refund check, because I do not like vendors holding my money for a credit that seems to disappear at times. The CSR said that they had spoken with their supervisor just yesterday about the issue and the supervisor had said it was not the policy of Spectrum to issue checks, rather they issue a credit or debit card. I said I would like to speak with the supervisor. Stephanie said she had spoken with her supervisor and that that person was not going to provide a different answer. Then she lapsed into how Spectrum pays its employees in card form. It was amazing how we went from talking about getting me a refund to her receiving paycheck via debit card!

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with your company for the past several months now, but you‚Äôd better get it straightened out fast. The TV portion is working right now but there have been issues with certain channels being heavily pixelated & freezing up at times to where you can‚Äôt even finish watching your show. It‚Äôs frustrating. But the internet is NOT currently working. I‚Äôm sick of paying you monthly for the full overpriced amount that I‚Äôm billed as it is, but this makes it ridiculous. You should credit people‚Äôs account & make our bills less when there‚Äôs so many issues with your service. I‚Äôve thought about changing jobs to where I could work from home due to health issues & convenience.

With that out or the way, this current app build is filled to the brim with problems. I attempted to notify Charter Communications support about them. I even notified their security team, both replied that the problem does not exist. I through my research found the app is leaking information through a previously known exploit. 
When I informed their security team of the bug, I used the standard CVE format, and apparently no one in their entire company knew what that was. The first person emailed me to specify what a CVE was, At first I tried to expound on the problem.

Separately I will agree that prices are high and there is no easy way to change plans TWC to Spectrum and be rewarded for being a long time customer, however I won‚Äôt allow that to influence my rating for this app and it‚Äôs improvements/refinements. 

Since being forced to move from Time Warner app to Spectrum app now I can‚Äôt check my home phone voicemail and now you can‚Äôt chat the agents, you must call or email.

They ignored my request. Finally the third call they said they could get a technician out but it would be a few days before they could. That was unacceptable because I needed the Internet for an important matter. They finally called me and got me a an appointment for the next day but when I called back the automation system said my appointment was still for a couple days later. When I asked to speak to the dispatch about the appointment they said they could not transfer me that no one calls dispatch. I finally resorted to a computer guru in my neighborhood. This man came over and fixed my problem within five minutes. What is wrong with spectrum? They have a lot of people there who don‚Äôt know how to fix a problem that a 70-year-old man was able to fix in five minutes. When it was Brighthouse service was 100% better.	negative

I was told I‚Äôd be charged $25 if a return payment was executed, not to mention the bank fees! All because I accidentally pushed a button when preventing my phone from dropping.

Speaking with the professional sales agent was very simple and the installation process was outstanding. I not only saved in monthly expenses switching to Spectrum, my family are over the top happy with our new Spectrum TV. I should have switched a long time ago. One of the best features is the Dodger Spectrum Sportsnet channel. We are huge Dodger fans and this has been one of the highlights in changing to Spectrum. The NFL channel and all sports channels are amazing. Lastly, the quality of our HD digital picture is clear and sharp and much better then the Direct TV connection. I have encouraged my family & friends to all switch to Spectrum. Great job Spectrum! You have a lifetime customer now!	positive
1965	942608209	utility	1	"When we signed up for spectrum we were told by the agent that our bill would be 127 per month and would not increase. When asked if this was a promotional option with a time limit, we were told no, and that our bill would not increase. One year later, our monthly bill increased to 145 per month. 

Additionally, we paid for Cinamax as part of our package. Spectrum stated that cinamax would no longer be part of our package and if we wanted the service, we would have to add it for an additional cost.

So when signing up for spectrum service, we were promised one thing and a year later they increased our bill and removed services from us. This is poor business practice. When speaking to a manager/supervisor, we were basically told that there is nothing that can be done and we would receive a 20 dollar credit. 

In a time in which Netflix and Disney + are better than cable, this is a bad game to play with customers. I‚Äôd rather purchase cheaper internet service from a different company than continue playing these games with cable service providers.

If you are contemplating getting spectrum, beware because the agent may lie to get you to sign up and then the company will go back on its word and charge you additional fees. When bringing this to the attention of their supervisory staff, we were told sorry for the inconvenience, but there‚Äôs nothing we can do.

Although the app does not feature alerts (even though it says it does) it is good to monitor your equipment, troubleshoot, change account credentials, and rename your home network device. I feel like it has much room for improvement in many ways. It does feature an auto install profile for BHN/Spectrum wifi hotspots which that is why i give it 3/5 stars. Nevertheless, this is a review for the app. If it were a review for the service i would have given less stars since they have changed to Spectrum they say it's the same BHN service and ""nothing"" has changed.

Thank goodness we get the paper bill to compare or else we would never know! Last month, we paid exactly what our app asked of us, which was apparently less than the paper bill. Spectrum then added a late fee to our next month, BUT ONLY ON THE PAPER BILL AND NOT ON OUR APP. So if we continued solely using the app, we would always be behind our payments. After spending an hour talking with representatives on the phone, we were apparently credited the late fee and were told that it wouldn't be an issue moving forward. However, this month we have the same problem. Our paper bill is different (more expensive) than our online app. I don't trust the app or the company and am looking to change providers.	negative
1974	942608209	utility	3	My family has been pleased with Spectrum in terms of picture quality, consistency of service, etc. We especially like the high speed internet, which is important for college students. If we have any complaints, it would be the rate increases after the promotional period ends. Our bill jumped up $44/month (from $112 to $156), which is a lot. The only other complaint would be that if you are more than 10 days late, they immediately shut off the service. This happens because we both get paid monthly but not always on the same days. We always pay the bill but sometimes miss the window because of the date the checks fall. You would think that consistency of payment would also count for something.	neutral

Reading other recent reviews has further solidified my annoyance with this app because numerous other customers are also trudging along with Spectrum, pleading for you all to join the 21st century and provide your patrons with a functional app. So I‚Äôll say it like this: it‚Äôs not me, it‚Äôs you. Fix it.

Two if their representatives admittedly told me that there was a problem and would refund the difference. That never happened. I would strongly advise against using this app to make payments. 

When I called to have it corrected, I was told that it was clearly Spectrums fault and I‚Äôd have a refund the next day. When it didn‚Äôt come I called back and they said the refund is coming and that they can see, in the system, that the unauthorized amount is coming back and is in the works. When it still did not come several days later I called and they said that they were not going to refund anything that I made that payment amount willingly. And they stuck to that stance since. All for just over $50

This is a disappointment as Spectrum had been great up to this point. But this was over the top and all for $50. 

Be careful with this app. Either it‚Äôs buggy now and they won‚Äôt stand behind it or I gave them too much credit in the past and they take what and when they want of your money. Either is bad and horrible for an otherwise great service."	positive

The new format looks like it was loosely put together without mapping previous settings or concern for removing features.

Update 4/20:
Still no response from the developer. I also agree with the other reviewers about several previously relied upon things missing in this app as opposed to the twc app. If you haphazardly create an app to replace a functional app, the least you could do is listen to your customers about loss of features then do something to rectify it. I reduced my rating from 2 to 1 stars accordingly, and would give the developers a zero if I could for non-responsiveness.

If I could give this app less than one star I would but one star is the lowest rating I can give it. I wish I had the option of using the old app instead of this terrible facsimile of a new and improved app.	negative

1991	942608209	utility	4	Overall I am satisfied with Spectrum.  However the remote control needs to be pointed directly at the box with out the slightest obstruction or else it won‚Äôt work. This might also have an affect on the remote control...your processors are slow. When you press a command on the remote control sometimes it takes 15-30 seconds for the process to activate. It can be annoying at times. My other tv that has no cable box, but is hooked up to Spectrum through a smaller box and has its own remote control responds quickly and moves from channel to channel with ease and with out delay. Please fix if you care about my Happiness! LOL!	positive
1992	942608209	utility	1	I had lost my internet connection and digital phone line 2 weeks ago for more than 2 hours, 2 months after they increase my bill. After the said event, they offered a lower rate supposedly with a faster internet. Yesterday afternoon, we had no connection again for few hours. Then last night I lost my connection again and it has been more than 6 hours now. Everytime I call, the voice prompt will just say there is a temporary system maintenance, worst is that it was unannounced. How long is this temporary system maintenance gonna take? This is just unacceptable, I have never experienced this long hours of no internet connection with my previous carrier. Also, not being able to talk to someone who can address the issue is too much hassle.	negative
1993	942608209	utility	5	"A lot of people dread calling customer service for many unpleasant reasons! Spectrum customer service agents cover the board in excellence! 
First, wait time! The dreaded wait time. A lot of companies leave customers dangling on the phone for ungodly lengths of time while the elevator music drives them insane! Spectrum does not. The automated guide is very efficient and user friendly. 
Next, if your issue can not be obtained by the automated menu, it reroutes you to an actual person! Both are very friendly & understandable!
Just to cover one more base, Spectrum customer service as always been able to resolve any issue I have had.  They patiently attend to the dilemma I called about but they also see it through till all problems are resolved!
I have always had respect and appreciation for any one who works in customer service because I am a customer service representative! Other companies should use Spectrum customer service agents for training! 
So thank you!!!"	positive
1994	942608209	utility	2	I don‚Äôt get it. I also don‚Äôt get listening to different ads promoting a gift cards uses before activation so I can turn around and just apply it to my new bill with you. I also don‚Äôt understand how I can‚Äôt transfer the same account when I simply move to a new place. I‚Äôd think it would be a much easier process, especially since people tend to move at one point or another. It is not an uncommon event. The only positive thing was the fact that at least I could scan the card in your app to give it right back to you. I‚Äôd think also maybe it‚Äôd be cheaper to send a check or a bank credit back to a person, and you could pass along the savings to your customers. Just my thoughts.	positive
1995	942608209	utility	1	At about 2 o‚Äôclock on a Monday morning I decided I would pay some bills so I went the new ‚Äúspectrum app‚Äù as I was trying to change the amount I was paying because I only wanted to pay the past due amount that I had for $187. I kept tapping the section to change it and somehow it took the whole $379 for payment. So right away I got on the computer to see if I could cancel the payment. No such luck! I didn‚Äôt want to get on the phone and talk to someone cuz it was pretty late so I did a chat and asked them to reverse the payment. They said the could, it might take a day or so. I desperately needed that money for my other bills that I had. So here it is a couple of days later and nothing. There should be a way to cancel a payment on the app or even on the website in case a mistake is made.	negative
1996	942608209	utility	1	I use an IPhone and I was a customer of of Time Warner Cable. When Soectrum first bought them them The Time Warner Cable app continued to work perfectly. Now as soon as I open that app I am immediately transferred to this Spectrum app. Ever since started I complained to Spectrum since the app never worked properly. From time to time as the app was updated it was never really improved. The only thing that actually worked was the ability to find out what your next bill was and when it was due. Now with this new update I can‚Äôt even open the app. It no longer recognizes my own life I user name or password. Maybe they should think about taking some of the unbelievable amount of the money the spend advertising what a great company they are and finally fix this joke of an app.	positive

1998	942608209	utility	1	App is super basic and is only useful to pay your bill or see past bills. There is no chat service, you can‚Äôt view your past payments, have a refresh signal sent to your modem, or view your plan amongst other things. It also tried to force me to give this a good review after having just downloaded it and used it to pay my bill. A pop up came up that I couldn‚Äôt get rid of asking if I enjoyed the app to answer yes or no. I hadn‚Äôt really used the app so didn‚Äôt want to answer but there was no way to close the popup. I had to quit the app and reopen it to get out of the popup. That being said, who knows how many people just click yes to get out of the popup inadvertently giving this a good review. This app sorely needs improving. Hopefully they improve it in an update soon.	positive
1999	942608209	utility	1	I won‚Äôt even bother to talk about any of the many problems with the app other than the glaring issue where the app saves your credit card information and won‚Äôt let you delete it. I DO NOT want my credit card information stored by Spectrum. I gave up searching the app trying to find a way to remove my credit card info and called Spectrum. When I called, I was told that I would have to wait 3-4 days for my payment to go through and then call back to have customer service remove the credit card. They told me this feature was added for my benefit in case I wanted to pay my bill and didn‚Äôt have my card. Bull S..t. If I‚Äôm paying my bill, I have my card. If I don‚Äôt have my card, I‚Äôm not planning on paying my bill. I will delete the app and not use again.	positive
2000	1094591345	games	3	I‚Äôm not even going to lie, I‚Äôm 27 and absolutely love this game. I grew up with Pok√©mon and this is by far the best Pok√©mon game. I stopped playing for a year or so because I reached the top level and got bored with it; about 6 months ago my husband convinced me to redownload it because of the numerous new features and two more generations of Pok√©mon that had been added to the game. Unfortunately as of lately I‚Äôve been having nothing but problems with getting it to load. This is now the third time in a week that I‚Äôve had to uninstall and reinstall the game and unfortunately this time it doesn‚Äôt appear to even be reinstalling. And yes the app and phone software are all up to date and everything like that. On top of that, on my other phone, if/when the game loads it no longer loads all of the way. It‚Äôs genuinely one of the most frustrating things I‚Äôve been dealing with because playing this game keeps me out of trouble and out of my own head. It‚Äôs definitely become my biggest hobby and biggest outlet, so when I‚Äôm stressed out to the max and it doesn‚Äôt want to load - which seems to be every single time I‚Äôm excessively stressed lately- it just makes everything worse. I was praying that these last batch of updates they did would have fixed that but I haven‚Äôt even been able to get the game to load since it updated! That is literally the only downside to it and unfortunately it‚Äôs a major one.	negative
2001	1094591345	games	3	Love the game. With the newer updates there‚Äôs a lot more to do in a more organized way. Most of the objectives of the game work flawlessly. The inner economy of items and Pok√©mon‚Äôs creates a wonderful system that makes you want to come back and play more. But, there are a lot of issues to still work out. One of which is the coins and gyms system. Right now, you can only get 50 coins per day. And a pokemon earns a single coin per 10 minutes in a gym. You would reach the max limit for coins in about 8 hours. This creates an issue, in which, if you have 4 pokemon in different gyms that have been in there for all over a day. Well over the limit. Meaning you could make 200 coins total, if they get defeated on different days. However, if they are all defeated on a single day then you only receive 50 coins for all 4, missing out on the 150. Currently, there is no work around this issue. You can‚Äôt recall your pokemon early, and if one gets stuck in a gym you are sitting there praying for it to be beaten. Another issue is with the combat leagues. When I first started the game with my most powerful pokemon at about 1000cp to try out the feature, the opponents were vastly unbalanced. I had to fight a 3000cp mewtwo on my 4th or so fight. It just seems that some of the features weren‚Äôt given enough time as opposed to other features of the game, and that lackluster approach clearly shows.	negative
2002	1094591345	games	3	"I got through the bad things about this app (Making an account took forever and I got stuck on loading) I have enjoyed the good stuff.  I am on a roadtrip and as such I have been able to sit down, relax, then get exercising because the game has plenty of Pok√© Stops in cities, suburban areas have schools as Pok√© Stops sometimes, and basically, as long as you are near a Pok√© Stop you can enjoy this app to the fullest.  Partly Cloudy weather has lead to me being able to catch so many different Pok√©mon and within a few minutes of playing I caught  an Eevee and I love my Water Pokemon that I caught so far (Water is my favorite type)
and I have enjoyed being able to play this game that has encouraged me to Pok√©mon GO outside and get exercise!  At first the app seems blank, sure, but then you walk around and find a group of Plusle, Minun, Geodude, and so many more.  And thankfully catching one doesn‚Äôt scare all the others away.  I haven‚Äôt caught Pikachu, one of my favorite Pok√©mon, but on this road-trip I feel like I am destined to find one.  I don‚Äôt care if I have to walk around the campground until 10:00 At Night.  I will do what all my years of playing Pok√©mon has taught me.  I will tell myself this everytime I feel tired and there is a nearby Pok√© Stop.
Gotta Catch ‚Äòem All!
But seriously.  Don‚Äôt put yourself in danger playing this app.  Even if that shiny Magikarp (The King of Carp!) is right there. Don‚Äôt drown for it."	positive
2003	1094591345	games	4	"I‚Äôm gonna keep this short and sweet I‚Äôve recently picked up Pok√©mon go again after about 7 months of not playing this game I once was obsessed with now I can say that it definitely has grown in a lot of ways but still things need to be changed starting with people in rural areas have a tough time really playing this game because of the lack of poke stops and variety of Pok√©mon given to them. I myself live in the Suburbs and also once lived in the city and FYI it‚Äôs such a drastic difference in terms of pokestops and Pokemon in general the cities are obviously flooded with both while the suburbs yet not completely empty still lacks the ability to grow within this game, but back to my point I have friends who love this game who live in much more rural areas and they just can‚Äôt really grow or have much fun with this wonderful game and they become extremely frustrated with it because they really must travel such a distance to be able to play this game it was obviously meant to be played with gym battles galore, pokestop madness and obviously new Pok√©dex entries. So I conclude this with Niantic you guys have really made this game fun again but please show more of a distribution of Pok√©mon, gyms, and pokestops to all your players across the country because I want this game to do better then it has ever been. 

P.s. sorry for the lack of punctuation"	positive
2004	1094591345	games	3	I like Pok√©mon GO it‚Äôs very simple now very hard to use and it takes you out of all of the house and help his people to walk about and explore but the one thing I have problems with is that when I logged on for the first time I was at level one and then also I had a glitch and also I became level six on the red team even though I never chose that team the problem with this Pok√©mon go is that the team that develop the And the support system there is terrible because when I tell him about my issue they won‚Äôt even respond to my problem I was trying to tell him that I did not pick my team and they were saying that we can‚Äôt do anything about it once you pick your team there‚Äôs nothing that you can do I also try to reset my account with my new email and I didn‚Äôt do any good like I had really had issue with the login is your for Pok√©mon go and the support staff on that game was terrible they need to learn to have some Consideration about their customers if there‚Äôs a problem they should take the time and look into issues instead of just sitting on the automated discussions about what we need to know stuff like that the support system was really terrible in my case I mean the game is fine not gonna lie but the support system is terrible though tech-support for their game is terrible I even went to the website and didn‚Äôt do anything about it	negative
2005	1094591345	games	4	"I started playing July 2016 but due to all the glitches and lack of Pok√©mon I stopped playing for a few years. The reason I started up again was because a friend recommended to try it. Now gifts can be exchanged, the Pok√©mon generations are mostly caught up, and there are a lot more stops and gyms to interact with. My main issue with this game is the lack of interaction with other players. I would like to be able to battle with nearby trainers like the real Pok√©mon game allows. Also during gym battles, there should be an option to switch Pok√©mon in between defeats. Those are the rules in a real Pok√©mon battle and this should be applied to this game. Pok√©mon should also gain experience after battles to help build them up. I understand the candy concept but those should be bonus experience/cp. I have lost a few great catches due to the glitches/network errors which is very frustrating! Other than that I enjoy catching Pok√©mon and spinning stops on my walk up to work through the downtown area. It‚Äôs a nice way to see the town.

EDIT
I forgot to mention: I‚Äôm not sure why but when I‚Äôm on the bus or in any vehicle as a passenger I should be able to spin stops for rewards not ‚Äútry again later‚Äù. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to allow me the option to catch Pok√©mon but I can‚Äôt get stops or gain steps with my eggs or buddy."	positive
2006	1094591345	games	4	"I played this game on and off since it first came out in 2016. And while I think it‚Äôs a solid game, it‚Äôs still missing out on some things.

There‚Äôs still really poor rural and suburban representation in Pok√©mon go, especially in regards to raids and pokestops. I understand if raids have to take place in towns, but it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have at least some amount of pokestops near communities. I live near a local park and there are zero pokestops there. I understand that there‚Äôs an option to create pokestops indirectly through another Niantic game, Ingress, but from my experience that game isn‚Äôt properly optimized for newer iPhones, and the base-building system is clunky and tedious. It would make more sense for Pok√©mon GO players to create new pokestops in gardens and parks, so that they can more easily play the game away from the city or towns. Another minor complaint is the sound. What was the deal with the sudden degrade in sound quality? Was that for saving battery life?
Another good thing to add would be to battle other players‚Äô Pok√©mon directly, instead of going to a raid or a gym and battling their Pok√©mon there. Niantic still needs to realize that not all of their player base is willing to drive 10 miles to go catch and see Pok√©mon. If these issues would be fixed this game would be 5 stars."	positive
2007	1094591345	games	5	I have played since the game fist came out and am happy to say this game is at its best right now. The main complaint I hear is that the game keeps crashing but it‚Äôs mainly for being on an outdated device or software other than that it people complaint that Pok√©mon don‚Äôt spawn at there house any more. The name of the game is Pok√©mon GO not Pok√©mon sit on the couch.  I have had nests of Pok√©mon at house before and they often come and go. This happen to keep the Pok√©mon feeling fresh and always have different Pok√©mon and most of the time it works. This game will not instantly reward you with amazing Pok√©mon you have to work for it like you were a real Pok√©mon trainer. I have put tons of hours/days into this game and not a single penny. You can obtain any item in the shop from playing the game but it will be hard (depends on if player around you are hardcore or not). The new events they have been adding have add even to do more then ever before with new Pok√©mon in the wild or raids. I have seen more people come back to this game in my community and hope that people will give this game another shot from it‚Äôs disaster of a launch. If your are unsure to try this game again or for the first time go for it because it‚Äôs now better then ever before.	positive
2008	1094591345	games	2	i love the game but i give it a 2 bc it needs updates for ease of use. im a passenger in a car alot and pokestops should be able to open and spin if were going past one at 60 mph bc some of the places we go by no one is walking to so the onlyway to hit it is from a car but like i said if im a passenger there shouldnt be restrictions. also i dont need the dont pokemon and go while driving message to pop up every time my speed changes if i say im a passenger it should acknowledge and not ask again unless i close the app and open back up if u have to create a license agreement stating that if u check this box and are using pok√©mon go while driving after it asks if ur a passenger and u aren't a passenger u cant sue if u get in an accident then do that . also the special stones and leafs and all that for upgrades should be way easier to get I'm level 28 and have never seen some of them and i have the candies to upgrade idk if thats just me but ... lastly ditto idk what i have to do but its the longest achievement I've been trying to get i cant ever find him and like i said i'm a passenger a-lot i go all over the state it's getting to the point where i don't wanna play anymore bc i cant get to the next stage of special research its a lil ridiculous like i feel like they should pop up once since i have 2 special researches for it but yea hope thats all taken into account before i delete the app bc i like playing	positive
2009	1094591345	games	3	"Update with the newest version. Really annoying bug I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs a bug at least. Every time you transfer or rename a Pok√©mon it always jumps back to the top of the list instead of staying where you were. Very annoying and time wasting change having to scroll all the time. 

I really like the changes in the new update. The weather pattern thing is great. The button push charge move in gym battles is a huge improvement. The spawn rates have improved. Overall a really great update. However, it has basically killed any usefulness the go plus device had. The catch rate wasn‚Äôt great before, but at least it was acceptable for what it was. That definitely changed with the update. With the weather feature causing affected Pok√©mon to be higher cp the plus is even worse. You just can‚Äôt catch an almost maxed out anything with a regular ball. I would suggest what I think would be a fairly easy fix. Maybe have the game automatically start a catch attempt with a suggested ball instead of a regular one every time. Ie... if it pops up and I see the circle yellow I switch to a great ball. Red goes to ultra balls. Have the game/go plus be smart enough to do the same thing. I have huge stockpiles of great and ultra balls so I‚Äôd rather the plus use those to improve the catch rate."	positive
2010	1094591345	games	5	To start this off, I want to let you know that this is a great game. Even though it was the craze a year or two back, I‚Äôve just started playing a week ago and love it! There‚Äôs only a couple things that I would like that might get other players back into it. First off, changing that battle system is a must. Players do not like the mad tapping and sliding you do when you battle a gym. Maybe switching it to the usual battle style will keep players happy. Secondly, I think adding battling and trading with other players will make it more enjoyable. I personally, don‚Äôt have the money to fly to another region and catch a Pok√©mon that is region specific. If we had trading, you could trade with someone elsewhere that might have the Pok√©mon. Also, the battling will keep players engaged to the point where they will try and beat their friends by catching more powerful Pok√©mon. Last but not least, I think you should add NPCs to the game. With the battle mechanics you could add trainers to battle against and earn rewards for winning! That would give players enough enthusiasm to go and battle trainers. Adding the evil organizations like Team Rocket could also add some spice to the game. That‚Äôs all I have, and thank you for reading!	positive
2011	1094591345	games	5	"I love the game so much. I got it a while back, but due to losing my account information I couldn‚Äôt retrieve anything from it. But it was okay, because I was still a sort of low level.
     I love that you can customize your character creation and walk around the map finding locations of places and poke. I just ask that there are more available options in customization.
      I kinda want more hairstyle options. I feel like having a unique character sets a more attractive mood in the Pok√©mon world. In the anime/cartoon, characters were distinguished by their hair shapes, eyes shapes, and what they wore...Oh and their colors! 
     If the developer doesn‚Äôt have time for that, maybe finding a way for a creator mode where those who sign up for it can create hairstyles(or other mod creations) for other players across the world. You can even have the creator mode set up where they pay for that kind of vip section, it may boost your product, who knows. Whatever you do and however you find, I really just want a different hairstyle üòì. 
     That‚Äôs it for now! I recommend this game to everyone! It is fun and addicting! Also helps your motivation for walking outside more and exploring the world."	positive
2012	1094591345	games	1	"For the most part you better have good connectivity with your mobile device or you will experience the most frustrating lag at times when you are battling other trainers thru the new go battle league schematic. I have lost tons of battles due to not my skill level but the servers not being able to connect my Pok√©mon fighting the other trainers Pok√©mon. 

 There are times where the Pok√©mon disappears or takes time for the servers to load the Pok√©mon on the map which delays the time frame of events like community days etc. if you carry an iPhone I don‚Äôt think this game will be any fun due to the lag and any other issues that come across over time. Even Samsung has trouble on occasion with the 5g connectivity in certain areas. The antennae‚Äôs on the iPhone are awful and are better used for taking pictures and just calls. But for games stuck with a Samsung note or the galaxy series to get a better experience.

 This game after four years in the making struggles to allow any fun for the user about 60% of the time. Playable only when poke stops are near by and if you are out and about. Absolutely unappealing due to the laggy servers and lousy deals from in app purchases. One star automatically until this issue is fixed which will never happen. There will always be crashes and laggy gameplay for more than half of the time playing. Also make sure you have the unlimited data plan so you can at least load the game."	negative
2013	1094591345	games	5	I remember when the game came out 2 years ago. It was rough around the edges at best. It was the first of its kind and was revolutionary but crashed often, servers struggled, and to path to being the best wasn‚Äôt strait forward. The game was good at keeping you active but that was about it at the start. I remember a year ago it started getting better in terms of crashing, but still the encounter rate of certain Pok√©mon made it seem like they actually weren‚Äôt in the game. All you could find were pidgeys and rattatas. When the legendary raids came out a spark of life struck the game but there was still a lot of room for improvement. Now it‚Äôs September 2018 and the game has grown so much. There are a lot more Pok√©mon, and I encounter rare ones periodically rather than never. I enjoyed the Chikorita community day earlier today as well. A crowded university with hundreds of people all doing the same thing was really fun! I crashed a few times but overall the game is a lot sturdier than it used to be, at least on the iPhone. I feel like Niantic is actually taking our worries into consideration to a certain extent. I hope the game continues to go in the right direction. With all said and done I consider the current Pok√©mon go 5/5.	positive
2014	1094591345	games	4	The games good I‚Äôve had it ever since it came out it has amazing updates and features like the buddy and egg hatching mechanic but one thing I hate are the challenges. The problem with the challenges (I‚Äôm talking about the special ones not the ones that you get from pokestops) are that they don‚Äôt count unless you had the challenge. If you don‚Äôt understand I‚Äôll explain, for the new challenge or Meltan go challenges there‚Äôs one specific challenge that took me a year to finally do, it was to catch a ditto which I had done an hour before I got the challenge.i had caught a ditto an hour prior of getting the catch a ditto challenge and the problem is it didn‚Äôt count towards the challenge, but not only that I had evolved a magikarp three weeks ago and I just got the challenge evolve a magikarp challenge I don‚Äôt want to wait another year to just get another stage of a challenge that I will inevitably will have to do that will take me another year to do I just want to play the game and earn the challenges that I did too early without knowing it was too early. I hope this is seen so at least I have some sort of reasoning for this and if this is seen by a developer thanks this game is really nice and I cannot wait to see what else this game holds in the future.	positive
2015	1094591345	games	5	"First let me say that I‚Äôm 53 years old, so I‚Äôm most likely not the average player of this game. I first became interested in the world of Pok√©mon back in 1998, when my older children discovered the TV show. Because of their heavy interest in all things Pok√©mon I took interest as well, trying to be a good dad. I invested HEAVILY in the card game, took the kids to weekend tournament each week, even became our local gym leader (because I was one of the rare adults who knew Pok√©mon as well as the children). Now we flash forward almost 20 years later an I‚Äôve re-entered the world of Pok√©mon through Pok√©mon Go!

The game is so well laid out, with quick and easy to learn game aspects, even for a newby to Pok√©mon. The best part of the game is that it‚Äôs design encourages the players to get out and move around. To walk and explore your town or city. Since every park, mall, restaurant, or store may be a hotspot for a new breed of Pok√©mon you‚Äôve yet to catch. I‚Äôve even been able to get my wife playing the game. Which says a lot since she almost totally avoided stuff back when our older children were heavily into the Pok√©mon world. 

This game is by far one of the best, most fun and addictive games I‚Äôve ever played. Once you start you‚Äôve ‚ÄúGOTTA CATCH EM ALL‚Äù!!!"	positive
2016	1094591345	games	3	I have been playing Pok√©mon Go on and off since it came out, and it‚Äôs undoubtedly improved since then, evolving into a mostly enjoyable experience, and Niantic has adapted to the restrictions of COVID-19 pretty well. However, there are some  things that desperately need fixing. The first one is raids: when a raid boss is defeated, the timer keeps running out for several seconds until the boss shrinks down and you can capture it. The timer should stop immediately once the boss‚Äôs health reaches zero. The second is Go Battle League: connectivity issues really ruin a lot of battles. I don‚Äôt want to win a battle because my opponent can‚Äôt fight back, and I don‚Äôt want to lose a battle because I‚Äôm taking damage and am unable to deal any back. There have been several instances where I will attempt to use a charge move, and despite no shields being used, it won‚Äôt do any damage to my opponent. And vice versa, I will use a shield, but I will still take full damage from my opponent‚Äôs charge move. If there is a connectivity issue, it should affect both players equally (read: neither should be able to do anything until it improves). It really ruins the excitement of GBL to experience something like that when there‚Äôs nothing you can do, and you still lose rank points for it. Please Niantic, fix these issues.	negative
2017	1094591345	games	2	I have been playing Pok√©mon go for several years now and about a year ago started getting into the raid. Until today I actually enjoyed playing Pok√©mon and doing the raids. I got the chance to do the new raid boss Giratina and actually had enough people to down the raid boss just before the time ran out. However I DIDNT GET Giratina because it would NOT stay in the White ball. I gave it berry‚Äôs but NOTHING WOULD HELP. I was not over throwing the balls and I didn‚Äôt miss 1 time but didn‚Äôt get the Pok√©mon because it would NOT stay in the ball AT ALL didn‚Äôt matter if I threw a berry or not. We do the raids to win the Pok√©mon and to do all that work and not win the Pok√©mon because it won‚Äôt stay in the ball is very wrong. It‚Äôs hard enough to actually find enough players to down a boss like Giratina where I live which is why I‚Äôm so very frustrated this happened. I‚Äôm sure some might think I‚Äôm just complaining but this is the 2nd time this has happened. I fully believe something needs to be done about this. If we are given these special white balls then it should be very hard for the Pok√©mon to brake out so we actually get the prize we are there for not break out as soon as it‚Äôs caught ever time. If that‚Äôs the case then why give us the special white balls .I don‚Äôt know if this has been happing to others I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one but I can say if this happens again I will stop playing it Pok√©mon!!	positive
2018	1094591345	games	3	I‚Äôve been playing Pok√©mon go since it first came out. There have probably only been 2 game apps I‚Äôve ever used for this long.  There are two things I‚Äôm currently unhappy about. How difficult it is for rural players to get some action. It is at least 5 miles to the closest pokestop‚Äî-there‚Äôs no way of walking that far, which I thought was the main idea of PG (getting people more active). There is NO Pokemon spawning near my home.  I can walk from one end of my road to the other end and there are 2 spots where they spawn. 2 lousy spots. Once I catch what‚Äôs there, it takes a while for a new one to spawn so what am I supposed to do? Turn around and walk the miles again for 2 more Pokemon? And the raid battles. There is no way on earth that a small town will ever get 17-20 people together to catch a legendary out here. It‚Äôs impossible even with social media.  My second complaint is the lack of revives! I understand that you want to make money on the game but come on!  Pok√©mon go is one of the few games I have spent money on. I have mainly bought lucky eggs and incubators.  No way am I gonna sink money into revives. I guess when all my Pok√©mon faint I will just quit the game. It wouldn‚Äôt be as bad if there was a way to earn coins in the game. I used to earn a few coins by defending gyms but you hardly earn any coins currently.	negative
2019	1094591345	games	3	This game is great. It is fun and does get you out, but some changes have occurred which have really made the game less fun.  First, there is really no way to get coins, which allow you to play, without buying them (you can get some things you need within the game but it cripples your ability to play much).  So now you have to pay to play more than just the minimum.   Next, there is no longer any incentive to fight to capture a gym or to hold one.  You can get 50 coins per day by holding a gym - but there isn‚Äôt anything you can buy for 50 coins in the game.  For instance, an incubator, which lets you hatch an egg, costs 150 coins.  And that‚Äôs it.  You don‚Äôt get any points or experience beyond just practice fighting and you Pok√©mon‚Äôs are stuck in the gym until someone takes it over - which there isn‚Äôt much incentive to do.  I‚Äôve had Pok√©mons sit there for days waiting for someone to take the gym.  I‚Äôve noticed players now no longer support their pm‚Äôs in the gym if they are under attack and some players put in very week pm‚Äôs so they don‚Äôt have to waste resources to revive.  As more players figure this out, fighting for and holding gyms will become a thing of the past.  And people without money to spare will find the game frustrating and limited.  So sad, because it really was a great, community game once.	negative
2020	1094591345	games	2	"I really loved this game back in the beginning, and I forgot why I deleted it till I recently reinstalled it to my phone. 

It is a major battery killer. Ever since I downloaded it three days ago, I have been dealing with my phone randomly powering off, even when I made sure to completely close the app, or I turn off my phone at half power, then go to power it back on after a few hours, only to find that my previously charged phone is suddenly dead and won‚Äôt turn back on. I don‚Äôt know if it is just the app, or there is something more to it, but it is rather coincidental that I started having these problems shortly after downloading the app. Today, my battery life was stalled at 100% for over three hours, and I did everything I could to figure out how to fix it, including restarting the phone and meddling with the settings. The battery percentage only started going down after I deleted the app. 

Like I said, I doubt it was the only thing causing the power drain, but the app certainly wasn‚Äôt helping, and I hadn‚Äôt ever had these problems that I listed till the app was on my phone. Which is too bad, because I love this app, it‚Äôs cute, and I really would like to catch more Pok√©mon, but I don‚Äôt want to risk it. I don‚Äôt know if I am the only one who has this problem, but whatever it is, I hope it is resolved and I can download it again one day."	positive
2021	1094591345	games	4	"People say that this game takes forever to load but it doesn‚Äôt. They say that Pok√©mon hardly show up anywhere but that‚Äôs not true they have been popping up all over the place. I can hardly go one minute without a Pok√©mon showing up on my screen. So those people need to shut their mouth unless they know what they are talking about. This game even makes lazy kids who sit on the couch and play video games all day get up and go outside.   It helps people get exercise and many people have said that this game has helped change their lives and those of many others. Pok√©mon is a great game and anyone who thinks otherwise can go cry to their mommies about it.  

       That being said, this app does need a little help. For instance pikachu is very rare in fact maybe a little too rare. I have heard many people complain about not even seeing a pikachu at all ,me being one of those people. Also there isn‚Äôt much to do on the game in rural areas and it would be nice if you could just do something with the game to make it easier on those living in rural areas. Also you need to make it easier for people to earn gold coins. Because most of us have been playing this game for years and still have not gotten any gold coins."	positive
2022	1094591345	games	5	I haven‚Äôt written a review for Pokemon Go yet, and I think it is about time. I have been playing since the day the game was officially launched and have loved it. I love the creativity, and all of the little details like team rocket taking over. The ability to play with my pokemon in the Let‚Äôs go Pikachu game on Nintendo Switch. I love how some community days I didn‚Äôt really catch everything I wanted to, but then the next time I catch twice as much, almost like it is making up for the last time. I love how the game is fair, you do not get everything all the time, but it is made up in other ways. One community day I remember it being awful, but part of the reason was I was in a bad location, so I didn‚Äôt get to evolve my Squirtle I think it was, but the next day I caught a Snorlax, it was just hanging out at my house. I love the incorporation of exercise and the idea of getting up and going to catch pokemon like a real trainer would. This game has meant so much to me, and I want to say that all of you at the Pokemon Company are amazing! In all of the games you create, the movies and episodes to the show that come out, the cards, the toys. I love it, and hope it goes on for so many more years to come!	positive
2023	1094591345	games	3	So, Pokemon games are about getting Pokemon and pitting those Pokemon against other Pokemon, right? Well this game is just that, but without the second part. Sure, catching Pok√©mon in the real world with AR is genius, but it gets old after a while. And the only way to battle other Pokemon is going to gyms. Now, what‚Äôs smart about the gyms is that you need to be a certain level to enter certain gyms, which encourages you to level up more by, again, getting Pokemon. Now, what I mean by the battling part of the game not being there is this: it sort of feels like an afterthought. If your Pokemon faint in battle, you‚Äôre in for some SERIOUS grinding. First, you have to get potions from pokestops so you can use them to heal your Pokemon. But oh no! If your Pokemon aren‚Äôt leveled up enough, you can‚Äôt heal them! Wanna level them up? Sorry! Nope! YOU have to be a certain level in order to level up your Pokemon, AND THEN you can heal them. This is literally the most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve ever experienced in a video game. Granted, gym battles are optional, but if the option is available, don‚Äôt make it so freaking tedious!! Although, I have hope that you will fix these problems, because this game used to have SEVERE internet issues, and you fixed that. So please, listen to my complaints and fix the grinding issues!!	negative
2024	1094591345	games	1	"I could be right where a pokestop is, and when I click on it it says ‚Äúwalk closer ‚Äú. How much closer do you want me to get??? Then all those annoying warnings about my speed when I‚Äôm not even moving is a HUGE NEGATIVE! The location accuracy is terrible; I can be right in one area, then the game will show I‚Äôm half way across from where I actually am. Furthermore, as they continue to add new Pok√©mon to the game; the same repetitive ones still show up consistently all the time. There‚Äôs no variety to catch unless you are walking all over the place; at random you may come across something worth the effort that‚Äôs IF the game is functioning properly; or if they have some sort of event happening. Lastly, I finally deleted the game because any time I have an opportunity to do something with the game, it ALWAYS takes a lifetime to load up EVERY time i get ready to try and play it, or it won‚Äôt load at all. Additionally you can‚Äôt play it if the game fails to read your location properly. I honestly wouldn‚Äôt recommend this game.

Update: now the experience as far as catching the Pok√©mon is worst! They seem to now make you use the augmented reality when trying to catch the Pok√©mon forcing you to lose several balls, because if you move the phone around you lose sight of the Pok√©mon too. It‚Äôs like they think they‚Äôre making this game better, but it just gets worse with each update!"	negative
2025	1094591345	games	4	The catching system is charmingly simple yet not incredibly easy, and the game provides incentive to catch Pok√©mon in the form of the Pok√©dex. And while legendary Pok√©mon are obviously going to be sought after as status symbols, the gym system is painstakingly easy, but the Niantic does give pretty generous rewards for participating in gym battles, such as up to 50 premium currency a day to keep all content technically free, but I find it a chore to go out to an isolated gym or to a gym in the middle of the night just so I can make sure I cap out on 50 pokecoins a day. It is nearly impossible to fail a gym attack once you reach level 20, which isn‚Äôt a long time at all, and thus victories don‚Äôt feel fulfilling and rather tiresome. But, the game does put an emphasis on meeting up with people to battle a difficult enemy, also known as a raid, but that is the extent of difficult content, and even then you will never need more than 10 decently leveled people to breeze through a raid. I understand the combat system for raids, but I believe the gym combat system could benefit greatly from a more engaging overhaul that adds more depth. Overall, however, the charming and incredibly fun catching system compensated for the uninteresting combat system and still provides an enjoyable experience.	positive
2026	1094591345	games	4	"I have been playing this game since day one. For the most part I love it! Gets me out of the house, meet new people, feel accomplished, and keep trying for something better. 
You get coins from dropping off pokemon at gyms. You can get 50 coins in a day. So spending money really isn‚Äôt required. Of course if you want more raid passes, cool gear, and more you can spend money. 
Now to the negative. There is some tasks that you fly through and some that take TO LONG! Catching a ditto is part of the task. I catch everything it tells me to and nothing. The odds are to low. Team Rocket needs major improvement. It‚Äôs not worth it to me to do team rocket. You get a chance to encounter a Zubat plus it‚Äôs evolves, Rattata plus evolves, baulbasaur one evolve, charmander no evolves, squirtle no evolves, and Dratini no evolves. Needs more variety. Another special event is a chance to catch a shiny koffing or ekans. I have caught more then 150 each and no shinys. One of my friends have one. The new rating system is awesome but Pok√©mon that you caught so long ago and probably not gonna get again are 1 or 2 star of a three star rating with high or low attack, defense, and hp. 
I don‚Äôt know how much space I have so I better stop. Game has highs and lows. Still enjoy playing. Just needs work."	positive
2027	1094591345	games	1	"Game used to be fun, then Niantic started enforcing their definition of what kind of fun you should be having with their game. I used hacks and location spoofing specifically because of Niantic shutting down any tracking program and the abomination they call trading Pok√©mon. The game location services gives errors more times than it loading properly. The game decides when you‚Äôre actually close enough to the stop/gym to spin for items. Instead of finding the Pok√©mon you wanted in an accessible public area, you‚Äôre forced to wander around potentially trespassing because being able to track isn‚Äôt fun to Niantic. When you trade Pok√©mon, all stats are randomly set so giving /receiving good stuff to/from your friends is fubar. Trading mechanics are completely random to the point that a good Pok√©mon immediately becomes trash to be transferred. Instead of putting in trading or switching teams to make the game somewhat enjoyable to play with friends or convince other people it‚Äôs not a waste of time, they hold events in cities that are only for the people willing to send them money and travel 500 to 2000 miles away. As well, that‚Äôs assuming that the real life events aren‚Äôt disasters like the first few events in Chicago.

You‚Äôre doing good following Nintendo‚Äôs model of just adding in more busywork rather than doing anything groundbreaking, guys. You‚Äôre right in thinking people only want a mile wide but an inch deep."	positive
2028	1094591345	games	2	"I have been playing PG since 2016. It‚Äôs a great game in many ways. I especially appreciate the attention to getting players moving - increasing activity is so good for health - and it avoids the pitfall of most smartphone apps, which tend to incentivize sedentary behaviors. But recently they‚Äôve started using language about ‚Äúburning calories.‚Äù At the end of each week, the app pops up a notification that says ‚ÄúCongrats, you burned a ton of calories this week!‚Äù  I have no idea why they would do this. First of all, it isn‚Äôt a weight loss or dieting app. Second of all, duh. You can lay in bed for a week straight and the human body will still burn about 13,000 calories. Calorie ‚Äúburning‚Äù is a biological function that doesn‚Äôt need congratulated. Movement doesn‚Äôt increase it that dramatically, and increasing activity levels is laudable and healthy REGARDLESS of caloric effect. Thirdly, and most importantly, this kind of language is incredibly dangerous and triggering for those who are recovering from disordered eating and EDs. If the developers had  consulted a medical or nutritional professional, they would know this. They are literally risking lives with this phrase. It would be very easy to correct. Do better, please.

Also, minor, but when will we get alternate hairstyles? It‚Äôs so frustrating to be stuck with long hair just bc your avatar is female."	positive
2029	1094591345	games	5	I love this game, I think it‚Äôs really fun and it was complicated at first, but now that I‚Äôve been playing for a while (not even that long), and with the help of my mom an brother we‚Äôve been able to figure it out. The only thing I have to say is about the avatar customizing. And it‚Äôs mostly on the hair. Ok it‚Äôs all about the hair. There aren‚Äôt that many colors to chose from, I mean I guess there‚Äôs enough for you to get a color close to yours (if you want your avatar to look like you of course). Like if you‚Äôre a red head and have more orangey hair the closest you get is a red that you can only get by dyeing your hair. Another part is the hairstyles. All there is, is medium length hair up in a ponytail. I mean it‚Äôs pretty accurate to my hair but not every girl has that length of hair and wears it up like that. I have a friend who has a pixie cut. I have a friend who has hair almost up to her chin. What about girls with curly hair? All they get is somewhat wavy hair put up in a ponytail. I know this is a long thing just about the hair, and I don‚Äôt even know what it‚Äôs like for the guys. Anyways. Sorry for this long thing about hair, but thought I should say something. Still love the game!	positive
2030	1094591345	games	4	I genuinely love Pok√©mon Go. I have stuck with it since it came out. There are some things I think would be cool to add. Trading Pok√©mon would be great but I understand why they haven‚Äôt released it yet. There is no defeating the game or beating a final boss or anything there is just filling your Pok√©dex, which with trading would then be too easy. I feel like you should be able to see other players in game their like avatars I don‚Äôt see why battling other trainers in the game would be a bad feature to add I think it would be fun. Also in the other Pok√©mon games there were healing stations, I get we have revives and pokestops but I have found it very hard to get enough to actually do battles. I have to say rural areas should have more pokestops and more accessible Pok√©mon. When the game first came out I lived 7 miles from the nearest pokestop. I have to get a ride into the small town near my where I lived and even then there were like 5 pokestops throughout the town. Maybe a way to message other players would be nice because I only know like 4 people near me interested in playing this game so if I could like message people and tell them I‚Äôm going to this raid battle come join that would be cool.	positive
2031	1094591345	games	2	"The base game is fun enough for a while, but once you've collected a couple dozen or even hundred of every Pokemon you have even the slightest interest in the only thing left it PvP, and oh man would it be better for my blood pressure if that just wasn't in the game. 

Almost every single team you're going to face is nearly identical and practically unbeatable unless you have a slightly better version of that same team or a perfect counter. You're going to lose to Giritina. You're going to lose to it a lot. It's stupidly powerful and everyone uses it. If you change your team to counter Giritina you will stop being matched with people who use Giritina. I'm 80 battles into the current league and 60 (I started keeping track after five in a row) of the teams I've fought had a Giritina. The remaining twenty battles were when I tried to just have a counter to Giritina, alternating between Umbreon and Darkrai depending on what I felt like using more. And every one of those twenty battles with a dark type on my team, not a single person I fought had a Giritina. I switched back to my usual team when I got absolutely fed up with this and was immediately bodied by the 60th Giritina. 

This isn't even taking bots and exploiters into account, both of which are frustratingly common and not worth talking about, it's just like you'd expect."	negative
2032	1094591345	games	3	I find myself on this game at least once every day. And sometimes it‚Äôs just to listen to the soundtrack. Despite how much I like this game overall, we could still use some tweaks to make it feel more like the other DS Pok√©mon games. For one, even though there are no longer pokemarts, I miss greeting nurses every time I walk in. I suggest having nurses at pokestops. Another thing would be the map. The map can be very inaccurate (especially in rural areas). Also the map is pretty boring. I‚Äôm not expecting any 3D visuals because I know that it would be hard to see pokestops with all that. Maybe at the least there could be more detailed grass and roads, with trees, bushes, and fields or gardens. The last thing I would like to mention is our characters appearance on the map. It would be really nice if our character was smaller because it looks way out of proportion compared to the road. Lastly the run is really annoying because it never runs the whole time but instead it takes short breaks, so it‚Äôs switching from running to walking  every 5 seconds. The run is not very attractive at all. Also you should consider adding an option to Naruto run. Everyone would like that. Thanks for taking time out of your day to read this.	positive
2033	1094591345	games	5	With my account nearing 2 years of age, which will happen on the 7th of July, I have been waiting for trading since launch, and I have to say I‚Äôm disappointed, the IV reroll destroys any want for me to trade with my friends, I don‚Äôt have any interest in spending the stardust for a Pok√©mon I would otherwise transfer if I caught. Though I understand that it keeps cheaters and spoofers from acquiring perfect Accounts that much faster I believe it really screws the people that have been playing for 2 years now. Having played for two years, my Pok√©dex is pretty much full aside from regional exclusives and I looked forward to this as being an ability to fill these holes in my Pok√©dex with people I raid with a couple of times a week, knowing this is going to cost a million stardust, or make me wait 90 day‚Äôs for it to drop to a reasonable cost,  has completely deterred me from trading all together. At the very least I would like to see the IV reroll be taken away. People are going to cheat, there‚Äôs no way around it, but I should be able to trade the High IV Pokemon that would make a much bigger impact on my friends teams then they would on mine .	positive
2034	1094591345	games	1	Long story short I had to delete the email attached to my Pok√©mon go account due to it being compromised. I spent a whole day switching over accounts but I had forgotten about Pok√©mon go. Of course since the email no longer exists I‚Äôm unable to sign in, so I contacted Niantic about it. I got an email where I had to answer a series of questions about my account like the last achievement I had unlocked or my last in app purchase. I hadn‚Äôt played in months because I have limited to no time while university is in session so I regularly play during breaks. So you can imagine the difficulty I had in answering questions about game progress made over six months ago. I was given two tries to get 11 questions like this right (all of them, in fact, you have to get right or they don‚Äôt help you and I got most of them right in the first place) and of course I couldn‚Äôt, so now I lost my account that I had since the game‚Äôs release. It‚Äôs really telling that a player who has been with the game since the beginning just gets tossed to the side like it‚Äôs nothing. The game is awesome but niantic has by far the worst customer service/assistance I have ever seen in a company. To think all of this could have been solved by having a couple of security questions like literally any competent website has. I will never play another Niantic game again because of this experience	positive
2035	1094591345	games	5	"I LOVE what you‚Äôve done to improve the game, with friends and raids and research and everything! One thing I‚Äôm bothered by, though, is the gym/coin system. 
I understand needing to put a cap on how much coin can be earned from having a Pok√©mon in a gym, but a 50 limit per day across the board seems stilted. For example, I had a Pok√©mon in a gym for a little while (a day or so), and when she came home she brought 50 coins. Awesome! But then, that same day, another Pok√©mon from a different gym came home - one who‚Äôd been at the gym for four days - and didn‚Äôt bring anything, because I‚Äôd already reached my daily 50-coin max. 
I just feel like the system could be improved - maybe keep the coin-every-ten-minutes but move the 50-coin cap to be per day each Pok√©mon is gone? So, if a Pok√©mon is only gone 20 minutes he brings home 2 coins, but if he‚Äôs gone for 2 days he brings home 100, regardless of what any other Pok√©mon brought home that day? Just a thought. But my four-days-missed Pok√©mon bringing home nothing was really a bummer, and I don‚Äôt feel incentivized to keep my Pok√©mon in gyms for very long, with the system working the way it does...."	positive
2036	1094591345	games	5	I love this game, but there is one thing I would appreciate if added. Me and my cousin have been playing this game together for about 2 years. We have made it a tradition for us to play this game during summer after we get out of school ever since we discovered it. We conquer gyms together, send gifts to each other every day, and catch Pok√©mon at the same time. We also spin pokestops, but most of the time we get an item that the other person needs. So, what we would like to suggest is to have the ability to trade items. We would love this, because battling gyms takes a lot of potions and catching Pok√©mon, especially flying Pok√©mon, takes a lot of pok√©balls, and we might need to trade in order to Catch Pok√©mon or revive them after we battle in gyms. I think this could be a feature that everyone would enjoy with friends. I really enjoy the feature that allows you to trade Pok√©mon with a friend, but I think this would be another great aspect to add to the game, even if you have to be great friends or ultra friends to access this feature. Thank you for your time and this has been a pleasure to play this wonderful game.	positive
2037	1094591345	games	3	"Now, before I get too far in the review, I will say I like the game. It makes me want to go outside and exercise. But parts of the game are broken. Like how I put 3 Pok√©mon in a gym, yet when they fainted (they were in there for 24+ hours), I was off the app and it gave me no coins. I was frustrated, and those gyms are far away from me, so after a long walk (I do it everyday,) I was drained. Another glitch is when Pok√©mon simply don‚Äôt get caught, and it is constantly in the ball, not loading me to the catch stats screen. As an avid 4-year fan, these glitches are getting more frequent, causing some dissatisfaction. And the challenges to maybe, just maybe, catch a rare Pok√©mon. And I still haven‚Äôt even finished the Mew challenges. The FIRST challenge series. Raids aren‚Äôt easy at all and in one challenge, I have to win 10. Those Ditto challenges though...those are so hard to do. What do raid Pok√©mon even do? But on the plus side, the game offers loads of things to do and there are many events to boost chances of some Pok√©mon appearing. All and all I wanted to report some glitches and things that need balancing.

EDIT: Found out there was a 50 coin limit per day. Again, needs to be fixed. This is especially annoying when you‚Äôre low on supplies."	neutral
2038	1094591345	games	5	As far as this game could had gone, it did pretty well for itself. Niantic had some issues at the beginning, but up to now it seems that most of those issues have been solved. And about the rural players.I feel you, I live in a small town too. But there‚Äôs still a way to play the game. All you have to do is participate in community days or other big events that get players playing. You can even get some of your friends to play, making your own squad to take down those tough raids. I play with 9 of my friends and it seems to be working pretty well. Anyway, great game, loving the events, etc. the only problem that I can think of is the spoofing issue. TweakBox, tutu app and other apps are coming out with the latest spoofing hacks and Niantic seems to be falling a step behind. I hate the idea of spoofing because players like me who have been playing the game since day one now have to compete with spoofers who can grab a bunch of Pok√©mon and legendaries overnight. I‚Äôd like this issue to finally be solved soon, but if it can‚Äôt oh well I guess. Aside from that this game is a game that I‚Äôll have for a looooooooong time. Keep up the great work Niantic!üòÅüëå	positive
2039	1094591345	games	5	"Pok√©mon Go is a fantastic mobile game that models the Pok√©mon franchise that is Pok√©mon. The Pok√©mon and art in the game are one-hundred percent the originals and nothing looks off from previous Pok√©mon games. The game is completely legit. When I think of a Pok√©mon Game this the one that‚Äôs first in mind. If you where ever a fan of Pok√©mon like I am then you must agree that Pok√©mon Go is pretty close to being perfect and still has room to improve. By being a mobile game the game the app has to update in time and there is huge changes with the game since the day it started back in 2016.  I give the game 5 starts for all the hard work that has been put forth to improve the game. It honestly is the best MOBILE game there is. You can take your device anywhere and now there is meaning why during the gameplay. You can meat people and learn about Pok√©mon in a way that I couldn‚Äôt before with the original game boy games I have grew up on. It‚Äôs Fantastic. The developers listen and reason with everybody they will explain why they do something the way they do. Niantic is a great developer and glad they took on the world of Pok√©mon with there Pok√©mon Go.

2040	1094591345	games	5	I really love this game but the fact that I cannot do a raid battle for a legendary Pok√©mon on my own is increasingly Aggravating unfortunately there are not many players that can come out during the time of legendary raiding I think it should be possible for any one person to take on a legendary Pok√©mon their self if they have the proper Pok√©mon to do so but that‚Äôs not the only thing I would like to say PVP is the most sensual part of the legacy of Pok√©mon GO and for it to not be included in the game is extremely unacceptable catching Pok√©mon is fun but to battle them with your friends and against your friends is the point of the game to be the best that no one ever was we will never be able to become Great trainers if we are not given the opportunity to put our hard work and time into The most important part of the game battling against Friends all the same I love the game but I am going to be taking a hiatus from the game until such time it is fair for a single trainer to take on a legendary Pok√©mon alone and we are able to battle against our friends I don‚Äôt really want to have to do this but the game is losing its point to play that is all goodbye for now	positive
2041	1094591345	games	4	Pok√©mon go has come a long way for what it was at first I don‚Äôt know absolutely everyone else but at first I dreaded updates because they always found a way to take away the fun of the game but it did make it ‚Äúsafer‚Äù I suppose. How ever with the recent updates Pok√©mon go has found a way to keep people coming back and even more excited about the game there are still ways I believe they could make the game even better though. Like ever Pok√©mon player loves a safari zone but we also like to battle wild Pok√©mon to help catch them. Why waist so many poke ball to lose the Pok√©mon in the end when you can battle them to make it easier like in the game. also it would be a way to further expand the buddy system they could not only gather EXP to raise there CP but could also be a way to gather candy for there buddy or battling Pok√©mon. Then people would have a better chance when having to face raid battles alone. A there would no longer be people opening there game and say oh I already have all of that then close the app. Instead they would open the game battle the surrounding Pok√©mon and make something out of it. It‚Äôs just the little things that make a game go so far.	positive
2042	1094591345	games	4	I‚Äôve been playing since the release and did drop off after a few months like most people due to the lack of things to do or catch until future releases. I‚Äôve been daily playing again for about 3 months and I‚Äôm impressed with all the additions and of course the variety of Pok√©mon to catch now. My only complaints and reason it‚Äôs not 5 stars for me are I agree with other reviewers that there needs to be a way to add pokestops and update current ones. And also the Pok√©mon generator is messed up where I live, at my old house (which was in a subdivision on the edge of town) there were loads of Pok√©mon wandering the streets, at my sister‚Äôs house (which is out in the middle of nowhere) there are still several at any given time although not the variety that are in town, at my new house (which is literally a block off of Main Street) there are none! None! Not a single Pok√©mon EVER! But if I walk over 1 block there are loads. And even on the other side of main there are Pok√©mon (although not many) it would be nice to be able to walk on my actual street since I live in the center of town but my street is Pok√©mon free sadly. There needs to be a way to report bugs like this in the app.	positive
2043	1094591345	games	3	I loved this game when it first came out and as I kept playing I got more and more into Pok√©mon then before I played. Even through gyms and having your own Pok√©mon there and some allies was really cool. But now it‚Äôs absolutely terrible that you have to constantly feed and monitor your Pok√©mon and for some silly reason if you put in a high cp Pok√©mon he loses his health more quickly! This new update is just really unfair and the update makes it so you have really low health Pok√©mon just so someone can use all there high cp Pok√©mon that can easily wipe out yours instantly. Believe it or not in the early stages of Pok√©mon go with gyms they were actually really well balanced and far having it so only a number of players are in the gym and people can use their high Pok√©mon to fight them and possibly kick them out. This is just a really bad update that was made and I hope it can change it was Actually fine in the past and probably the only players who would say that it was difficult and over powered was players with low Pok√©mon and just complaining about Other players having higher Pok√©mon. I personally hope it is changed but I am having really high hopes for the red rocket update and am really excited. But please change the gym update.	positive
2044	1094591345	games	3	This game has the absolute worst battle system of any game ever created. It brings shame to the entire Pok√©mon brand. Battles are mindlessly frustrating tap fest with unbalanced and some downright game breaking attacks, dominated by legendary Pok√©mon that are incredibly difficult to obtain and, suffers from horrendous lag no matter what your internet connection is turning sure wins into losses. Charged attacks can be spammed within seconds doing more damage than you can hope to endure while your charge bar is not even a quarter full. Not very effective attacks pretty much always halve your health and Psystrike is is usually a OHKO to everything no matter what. Some fast attacks do a pittance of damage and attack extremely slowly while others move faster than you can blink and kill you before you can even switch. Type  effectiveness the core mechanic of the games, is essentially non existent with psychic types obliterating dark types before they can act and ghost types being swept by a barrage of normal type attacks. This Battle system is the absolute worst and even if the devs addressed all of these issues it‚Äôd still be the worst by hundreds of miles. Give us real battles with strategy and fun, not a boring taping game with no balance or logic to its play.	negative
2045	1094591345	games	5	This is a great game. but the spawning of pok√©mon are lacking a bit. the insense are good but i have timed the pok√©mon and for a 30 min span it‚Äôs to far apart atleast out of 30 mins you should spawn 5 pok√©mon. another spawn problem is that there are so few pok√©mon to begin with. i say commons should be around a lot but nothing really around at all. another thing is as i quested to get a ditto i have realized that excellent is almost impossible. the ring size i have gotten to and still only get great is insane i have gotten where the ring is a fourth of the size of the ball and still only great. this should be fixed. i can not complete mission if i can get excellent. i have not seen many that have gotten this this pok√©mon with out the switchbeing involved in it. another thing is you should open the ring up to a bigger area for people to see more so they do not have to go into a home or hospital. this can make things fun for the fact the farther you are on the circle the farther the pok√©mon is away could me things fun and you could add a new medal for this. i hope the company sees this and will help out all of the trainers with this issue.	positive
2046	1094591345	games	2	"The past month or so has been a giant crap-fest of screwing over the main consumers of the game. Like, sure, spend three months putting the legendary birds in raids with a shiny chance, let your players spend $20+ on raid passes under the impression that they'll never have a shot at one in at least the next year, and then at the end of all of it release all three for a month as a ""bonus"" to nullify their efforts and bank account emptying. Not only that; spend over a YEAR watching people rush from their homes to complete raids at ex-eligible gyms for a shot at getting an ex-raid pass, only to release mewtwo for everyone? I just took a 3 hour long trip to nashville yesterday to complete an ex-raid because they were really that rare. Now apparently in a few weeks they're going to start spawning everywhere. And don't even get me started on lucky pokemon. Everyone that's actually into the game traded all of their old pokemon off for a higher lucky chance immediately. And everyone that didn't, already received 10 luckies and missed their chance at guaranteed luckies permanently. It almost feels like a reward for those who broke the rules and made multiple accounts; because who else is going to trade someone a guaranteed lucky valuable pokemon in exchange for a 10 cp bulbasaur from 2016?"	positive
2047	1094591345	games	4	Let me start out by saying: I love the game. I originally got the game when it first came out and stopped playing after a few months but ended up coming back to the game a little over a year ago. Recently I‚Äôve started noticing that the Pokestops items ratio is very skewed. The main items you can receive are pokeballs, berries, potions, eggs, and if you are lucky, some sort of evolution stone. My main concern is the rarity of some of these items. Pokeballs are the most common item which is good as you can lose those quickly if you catch a lot of Pok√©mon. The second most common item is berries which is fine, and the third most common item are potions. I keep finding myself in situations where I‚Äôve just defeated a gym or raid and I need to heal a Pokemon but I have nothing to do it with. I have an abundance of berries but no potions. And it‚Äôs kind of annoying as I want to participate in raids and gyms and even the new team rocket go missions but I don‚Äôt  have any Pok√©mon that can participate as they are all super low level. I feel like the potion to berry ratio needs to be switched or updated in order to fix this flaw in the game. Again, I love the game, but it‚Äôs making the game nearly unplayable for me.	positive
2048	1094591345	games	4	"i love the game and the gameplay can‚Äôt really get any better than it already is, however there is one glaring issue with the game. it has a few sound design issues. the sound effects that come out of my iPhone XS are so low resolution, it sounds like a Nintendo DS Lite. Every time i click a menu button there is an awful sound that sounds fuzzy, distant, and grainy. the game would be top notch if they simply added that. the music doesn't have the same problem, so why do sound effects which are equally (if not more important) hinder the experience of the game?  
i do have an issue with the music. why is it still this generic Pok√©mon GO song? why not remix some old route themes from all the different generations of Pok√©mon with Pok√©mon GO instruments? imagine running around your neighborhood catching Pok√©mon with a remix of route 209 from Sinnoh? that‚Äôd be so great, and its been 2 years and i‚Äôve heard people argue for this in the past.
I just cant justify five stars when the sound design is so effortless, and its been like that since launch. if they revamped the quality of sound effects this game would be perfect, i dont even need the music. fix those grainy sound effects!!!"	positive
2049	1094591345	games	2	I know this will only be read by people who obviously had Pok√©mon go. Honestly, who didn‚Äôt? It was the biggest thing in 2016 and everyone who wasn‚Äôt playing was on another world. The thing that I want to point out to niantic is that their customer service is horrible. Literally the worst in the business. I feel bad for them because their game had so much potential. It was bringing Pok√©mon to the ACTUAL world. Now the only thing that they can say they properly did was help kids get jumped at parks at 3 in the morning. Sadly, the game hasn‚Äôt changed much in the past 4 years and the only real things that changed is the grind to get just one shiny to be proud about. I expect nothing to change. I tried to help Niantic with creative ideas for the past 4 years and none of them have come to fruition. You still can‚Äôt even battle strangers! That‚Äôs like THE ONLY thing you do in Pok√©mon! It‚Äôs crazy how poorly they have delivered. To sum it up, I would just like to say to Niantic, listen to the players and listen to your customers. The only reason why we play is because we actually love Pok√©mon. The things we don‚Äôt love are the way you handle our childhood memories making us pay for every little thing just to get ahead. Pok√©mon was made for the adventurous not the ones with the deepest pockets.	positive
2050	570060128	education	5	If you are just starting out on a language this is the app. You learn words effectively and it is very good at encouraging to learn. The unfortunate thing was it got very repetitive and takes some time to get through to learn new words. It was very good when I first started learning Norwegian or Norsk Bokm√•l. I got the basics but really just basics. Duolingo won‚Äôt make you fluent but it is a great starting place and language practice tool to have when first encountering a new language. Don‚Äôt expect yourself to learn an entire language with Duolingo alone but it is great when wanting to practice the language you are learning or getting a few new words. Once again, it doesn‚Äôt feel like you are making super fast progress or you have grown quickly but I always enjoying going on and practicing. Another problem is that I never really understood why something was some way and Duolingo did not really do a good job explaining the reasons behind something so I was left confused. The good thing is these questions can be answered on the forum that Duolingo provides. Also the pronunciation does not appear to be given. All you could do was hear the word but I could never tell if the letter ‚Äúd‚Äù was pronounced at the end of some words or not. I had to learn this outside of Duolingo. To conclude this is SPECTACULAR language learning app and I recommend it for all who want to try a new language.	positive
2051	570060128	education	5	After having used Babel, Busuu, and Rosetta Stone I‚Äôm surprised to say that Duolingo is absurdly better made than I used to think. I‚Äôve been using Duolingo on and off for years (half-heartily for awhile and only seriously in the recent past) and I‚Äôve found that the flaws which once seemed glaring are actually not as bad as some other language learning apps. The voice work is an order of magnitude better than Busuu and the lesson structure ,despite seeming somewhat obtuse, is actually incredibly helpful. The pseudo game structure of lessons also helps to keep practice from becoming too much of a chore. I‚Äôm probably not saying anything new here but I feel like the only thing that keeps Duolingo from being vastly superior to other language apps is the lack of grammatical instruction in some of the languages. Languages like French have more recently had grammar lessons added even from the start of the course, but Korean has none. From my use of other apps that do a better job explaining grammar I‚Äôve found that Duolingo works really well as a companion app to build vocabulary and just practice hearing/using the language, and is possibly more useful once you have the basics of a language down. The only other language app I‚Äôve used that comes close to rivaling the versatility of Duolingo that I‚Äôve used thus far is Lingodeer which is much better for learning Korean than any other app I‚Äôve encountered.	positive
2052	570060128	education	4	"I have to say that Duolingo has taken me to a new world of languages. I can spend my whole days practicing with Duo and increase my ability of using languages. However, there're still things that I'm not satisfied with this version for IOS:
- the discussions after answers: I've wait for them since a long long time ago. I believe that Duolingo is not only a software for learning languages, but also a special environment for everyone to enhance their skills together. Using Duo on IOS is quite convenient, but if I want to check my answer with the other's, I have to login my account again on the version for web browser, go to that skill, do it and seek for the question. That's not good at all! 
- The report: Nothing happens when I press the button to report the errors (most of them are translation errors). My and other's reports are the very efficient tools to help Duo better, and we want to see that in the near future. 
- The club should be added to web version and the currency systems - gems - needs need to be synced. Anyway, the life point is awesome, but we want more games, or tournaments, or challenges, or... something like that, just to increase the competitiveness between leaners. 
I know that to solve with the problems I've listed above will take a lot of time and money and labor power, but we can believe with our effort and strength, the future of Duolingo is brighter than ever! Duolingo is the sweet home for everyone!"	positive
2053	570060128	education	4	"Since the recent update (late April 2018), on my iPad Pro DuoLingo app, the word boxes and the type within them, which one taps to put together a translated sentence, are frequently appearing much smaller than the helpful size they consistently were before. Sometimes they appear in the original size, but more often now, even with a short sentence where there is no problem fitting them on the page, they are very small.  Harder to read, and harder to accurately select.  And I have small hands/fingers. 
I lost several ‚Äúhealth‚Äù bars and had to stop my lesson sooner than in the past, because I was selecting at the speed I always have, and realized I could not have the confidence I had grown accustomed to, that when I think I have touched a word box, it is selected. So my learning process is slowed not because I am selecting the incorrect word and losing health, but that I have to stop and check more diligently to make sure the box I tapped (or tried to, but apparently did not hit the now very small ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù on it which selects it), actually shows up in the answer box.  This was NEVER an issue before the change in word-box size. 
Please make them, if not as large as they have been previously, larger than they are after this recent ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù. Very annoying in an otherwise wonderful app...you folks say you want to make learning easy, and my feedback is that this tiny type in close-together boxes, is an impediment to learning. Thank you."	positive
2054	570060128	education	4	Since I can‚Äôt send Duo Lingo an email to give them an opinion I‚Äôll put it in a review. I‚Äôve been using the app now for probably 8 months as a plus subscriber. In general the app is good. As I‚Äôve progressed forward though there are simple things that are extremely annoying for example I was working on Spanish past tense and I spelled the name Sarah as Sara (another common English spelling of the same name). The entire sentence in Spanish was correct but my answer was considered wrong because of the missing ‚Äúh‚Äù. This was a verbal/audio sentence I had to listen to then type the correct answer. Also as you progress and write English from Spanish there are perfectly correct English translations you might write that the app considers wrong. I‚Äôm guessing because this app is actually designed by a non native English speaker; the creator of Duo Lingo is from Central America (Guatemala I think; but listen to his story on the first season of their Spanish podcast). I like the app and enjoy using it but I‚Äôm finding I‚Äôve been seeking other ways to learn because some of the grammar isn‚Äôt quite covered or the reasoning behind certain language rules isn‚Äôt explained and I simply need more. Also a common complaint is that they send way too many emails if you stop using the app for a day or two or longer and it feels like a stalker. Luckily the email I used for it was not my primary email because when I checked that account it was flooded with Duo Lingo emails.	positive
2055	570060128	education	4	"Great free app, very helpful and useful in learning new or refining old languages. However, it still needs work in my opinion. 

I am learning Spanish and I have learned a lot more than I already knew in a couple days... but there are times when using a proper word is necessary to succeed and move on, but I have to restart over and over again later (after practicing, to get health to play) ...because I picked the right term but wrong specific word and no explanation is given as to why. I.E: Yo (means I) has to be followed with an o in the use of words like como (eat) or bebo (drink) instead of come/comen/comes or bebe/beben/bebes (as I learned through searching), but no explanation is given as to why. It‚Äôs frustrating and infuriating. This needs to be explained and taught for proper teaching of other languages. Also, why does the asterisk above certain Spanish words apply but not on others? Learn it all or don‚Äôt even try I say! 

Finally, turn down the need for health as often, or turn up the regeneration rate. I read it was said that they are trying to make learning free. So do it more, please. Stop making me practice over and over again just to get 1 bar of health (works on only 1 mistake before failing) and have 1 measly chance at succeeding just to have to quit, practice, and start ALL OVER AGAIN; only to fail because I don‚Äôt understand what I did wrong! The ads are bad enough and should be sufficient... but then there‚Äôs this! Please fix!"	negative
2056	570060128	education	5	"I‚Äôve been using Duolingo for a while now to practice my French, and in the time I have had the app I have tried out several other languages too (including Spanish, Russian, German, Klingon, etc.). The games make learning fun and the teaching style helps keep the terms and sentence structures ingrained in my memory very well!

My only request/hope for this app (not a complaint, I love the app) is that while I appreciate the inclusion of fictional languages like High Valyrian and Klingon, I would like for there to be more significant languages to be added to Duolingo‚Äôs roster of classes as well. Widely-spoken languages like Arabic and Bengali are noticeably absent on the course list (for English-speakers, not sure about others), as well as Finnish, which is a little strange because Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish are all present. Personally, as someone whose family comes from the western Balkans, I would love to see a language course on Serbo-Croatian, since it is a difficult language that I believe Duolingo would be an excellent tool to help me to become better at it. Recently, Hawaiian and Navajo were added to the roster, which excites me and makes me hope for these languages to be added sometime in the future as well. 

Overall, I love the app and will continue using it to study foreign languages! I look forward to seeing more language courses added in future updates! üëç"	positive
2057	570060128	education	5	"This app is really helping me to learn very quickly. I am learning Greek and brushing up on Spanish. I wish it would handle a few things differently Among them, letting me test out of Spanish levels further along the way than it does, but I understand they are testing whether that feature is more or less beneficial for learning at the moment.  So, I upvoted the feature :). The other thing is that the adds are locked in portrait mode and the ‚Äúpractice‚Äù tab also starts out and sometimes gets stuck in portrait mode. I have tor turn my iPad to portrait and back to landscape and it usually switches to landscape then, but not always. I pretty much always use my iPad in landscape mode. Especially when I am using the keyboard, which the app has plenty of. I wish that the whole thing would just be in the orientation of my screen without changing/ trying to figure out which direction it should be as I use the app. Otherwise, this app has been AMAZING and, while, I‚Äôd love those improvements, I‚Äôm really just being nit picky. I didn‚Äôt feel it deserved any less than 5 stars because the rest is awesome!

One note, if anyone is having trouble understanding anything in the language you‚Äôve chosen or with the app, visit the website and check out the discussions tab. There is a lot of helpful info in there and many other language learners who are very happy to help out!"	positive
2058	570060128	education	3	The app is nicely designed and has good variety of testing formats, but each level takes FOREVER to pass. Some have 20 rounds before you can move on - and each round is the SAME thing. Even some of the levels seem the same. This feels like a waste of time for the learner and has made me start practicing even less (therefore using the app less) because I already know the material by round #5. I don‚Äôt need to review it 15 more times. Please make the progress faster, perhaps integrating some review of previous levels into later ones to ensure retention. Also, please allow us to skip levels more easily - right now it takes 400 gems to pass a level, and that takes many days of repetitive practice (of topics I already know) to accumulate. Not worth it. I even made a separate account to start over and take a placement test to hopefully bypass some of these basic levels. I did much better on this test that my first one, yet the levels they put me on seemed the exact same as on my other account - does the test actually place you anywhere other than the beginning? I get that you‚Äôre trying to make money by encouraging us to pay for more gems, but what you‚Äôre actually doing is discouraging me from using the app. (Plus, with all the ads, I already feel sufficiently encouraged to pay for premium.) Perhaps just make the number of gems we‚Äôre awarded for meeting our daily goal much larger or make the number required to pass a level much smaller.	positive
2059	570060128	education	3	This app is great and all, but I‚Äôve found that the desktop site is even more interesting and helpful. The app is very limiting. While the desktop version includes a better discussion board and quite a bit more info. HOWEVER, I have noticed some annoying changes in the desktop site. They are expanding the app, and diminishing the desktop site. Which, obviously, I really don‚Äôt agree with or like. If I needed more in depth information about a lesson, as they are usually very cut and dry on the app, I would sometimes go to the site and there might be extra pointers on certain things I wasn‚Äôt understanding. I keep trying to do things on the site and it keeps taking me back to the mobile version or a complete replica of the app on my browser. I get that they seem to be aiming at continuity and flow, but please do not take away all the information and good of the desktop site in order to grow the app. I also really miss being able to see my progress on each language. I liked being able to see how much further I had to go before leveling up. But apparently they removed that feature, while still keeping the levels???? Which is beyond me. Just seems like an added annoyance. One of my biggest pet peeves is needing the desktop site and even requesting it on my iPhone and still getting the mobile site or having to continually click Desktop Version/Full Version because every link takes me to a shortened version/aka the mobile site. Soooooo annoying.	positive
2060	570060128	education	5	I have been using Duolingo to learn French for a little while now. If you really want to be good at it I suggest working over and over on the basics 1 and mastering it, and continuing to work on it even after mastering it until you know the basics 1 words 100%, which is what I did. It‚Äôs a lot better to know the words than to rush through and not actually be able to remember them. One thing is, I have started the ‚Äúphrases‚Äù section. Usually when you start a new section and it gives you words you haven‚Äôt seen yet, they will put a dotted line under it where you can see what it means and then eventually remember it. However on some new words it doesn‚Äôt give me the meaning and asks me to translate anyway. Since I don‚Äôt know the meaning of the word because I‚Äôve never seen it I get it wrong and lose my health. I have used this app a long time ago to learn Italian (which I‚Äôve since stopped) and it would always give me the meaning of the word, multiple times even. It‚Äôs just annoying to me that I have to lose my health because I don‚Äôt know the meaning of a new word. It‚Äôs not too much of a problem that I will delete the app, but something that could be fixed. I recommend using the computer version of duolingo for learning new words and phrases, and just using the app for strengthening your skills. Overall though this app is great!	positive
2061	570060128	education	3	"I used to use this when it was completely free. As in when you ran out of hearts and failed the lesson you returned to the main menu with full hearts. I understand wanting to make money with this app but the price is ridiculous especially with all the other free and lower priced apps out there. I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying a one time flat fee of a lower price but I‚Äôm not making continuous payments on something that used to be free. Especially when you get all the ads that say keep education free. 
      My main gripes with this app as others have stated is the fact that there is no explanation when you make an error. You just have to try to remember the correct answer when the question comes up again. No explanation of what you did wrong. I need a clear explanation of how to conjugate verbs and this is showing me nothing. Also when you make too many errors you fail and have to wait until your hearts are refilled. The amount of time it takes your hearts to refill is insane. Two days later when my hearts finally refill I‚Äôve already forgotten the lesson so I‚Äôve lost that information. 
      In general this app has taught me a ton of Spanish and has been fun and easy to use. I just wish their were more explanations for mistakes and also wish the pricing/ hearts issue could be addressed. Maybe offer premium lessons and charge for those instead? Like I said I would pay a REASONABLE amount to be able to have unlimited hearts."	negative
2062	570060128	education	4	I have had Duolingo for maybe a month now and I‚Äôm level one on all of the first group of things. Now there are a few things I‚Äôd like to address. Duolingo is really great because I‚Äôm taking French this year. However there are many huge problems with it too. One is with the practice for a heart. I have been doing it right, le restaurant. But every time I type it no matter how I tweak it it says I‚Äôm wrong and knocks me down so I can‚Äôt actually ever earn that heart because it keeps giving me the same question which has the wrong thing happening. When I get it wrong it shows me the answer- exactly what I typed. It kind of drives me nuts. Other than that, the hearts system is really stressful because it basically tells you that making mistakes is horrible and that you literally have to pay for them. Now I know that‚Äôs not the point but it sure feels like it because failing a lesson sure feels horrible, doesn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of bugs Duolingo has that I haven‚Äôt uncovered but I really wanted to put this out there. Other than these things, Duolingo is great and it‚Äôs a great choice to assist in learning a language. But seriously the hearts system crushes your soul and it sure doesn‚Äôt help on a bad day. And yes I understand Duo plus is better but come on, I just want a free language app. So if you‚Äôre still reading this thanks for listening to me little Duolingo rant. Have a great day.	positive
2063	570060128	education	4	"I stared using this app half a year ago and I can already do small talk with my step mom,she does help me though the app does teach many things sometimes having a person explain something helps,I‚Äôve heard that the computer version is more challenging and advanced but I have to stick to my app version I love everything on doulingo and I can text pretty decently because reading French is easier,and understanding the slurred words is difficult tho on the sections where you need to type what they said with out any words just a voice they have a slower option he only thing I really don‚Äôt like is that they took away the ‚Äúfake texting feature‚Äù I LOVE all the new features hey added but sometimes I have no one to text in French and it‚Äôs kind of like a real conversation,I hope I am not the only person who feels this way,I bet other people trying to learn German Chinese Thai Spanish English,etc.  may like that feature if the came across the app after it had been taken away.

2064	570060128	education	5	This app is SSSOOO effective! When you start out you sign in with your email. If you want to, the app will give you a daily reminder to practice or start a new lesson. It will also email you if you get behind in your lessons, which is great for me bc I always forget to practice!üòÇ You choose the language that you want to learn and then your all set!! No bugs and it works great. And after learning the basics and finishing the first three lessons than you can actually have a conversation with automated people in that language!! You have to try to understand their questions and answer them and if you haven't learn a word yet that they say or you forget what it means then you can just click the word and it shows you the translation. It is AWESOME!! You HAVE to get this app!!!!üòÑüòÑ.  You can also join a club with actual people learning the same language as you! You can encourage each other and post your latest progress and you can also make friends and follow people you know and make a profile picture so that your friends can find you!! You can also make your own club if you want to!!! It is absolutely amazing!!!! If I could I would just tap that download button for you so that you be able to try out this app!!üòú you have to get this app! I hope you take my word for it. PEACE OUT!!!!‚úåÔ∏èüòÇ‚úå	positive
2065	570060128	education	5	"I have been using duolingo since it‚Äôs early early days. It has always been the very best language teaching platform around. More and more however, the app seems to be becoming more of a children‚Äôs game than a learning platform. Each update adds a more ‚Äúgame-like‚Äù feature or page. And more concerning, is that with every update the developers seems to be removing the parts of the app that make you want to come back to learn. The first of these negative transitions was the removal of the learning percentage, and the addition of ‚Äúcrowns‚Äù in it‚Äôs place. Can‚Äôt speak for everyone but, fake crowns do no good in my learning... maybe introduce crowns along side a percentage. However, the most recent of these negative transitions is the addition of  ‚Äúhearts‚Äù. Learning a language comes with making a lot of mistakes... how is anyone supposed to learn if they are told they cannot continue after making a specified number of mistakes? This is a huge step in the wrong direction for the app and hopefully the duo team will recognize it before it‚Äôs too late. I find myself rarely using the app now due to the ‚Äúheart‚Äù addition. Seems to deter users from prolonged use. For the sake of learning, please steer the ship back to where it came. Go back to your roots duo. 

On a side note, duo team, you need to create a way to allow user feedback."	negative
2066	570060128	education	4	I like this app. However, the app is NOT as detailed in explaining Spanish rules as the website and I highly suggest if your Spanish isn‚Äôt as fluent, please use the website in conjunction to this app to get explanations on the rules. I say this because on the app, you are constantly penalized for wrong answers and when you lose health, you either need to spend your jewels (fastest) or practice (time consuming) or wait for the health to regenerate (the most time consuming). So, I‚Äôve been going back and forth on the website and app so I don‚Äôt lose as much health. I do not like how the app penalizes you so much! It makes me lose motivation to continue the sessions because of the waiting period to regenerate health... and you spend a lot of jewels at once in order to obtain health. The app is fun! You earn rewards and streaks... all to motivate you to keep practicing. I like earning the jewels because you can use them to purchase health and other fun things in the app. The streak count makes me want to practice everyday! I like how you can join groups with other people that are learning the same language and you all can motivate each other. Your detailed profile information isn‚Äôt shared with them; it‚Äôs pretty basic where you know everyone‚Äôs screen name, languages they‚Äôre learning, and rewards they‚Äôve obtained and that‚Äôs all. The app is convenient on the go for sure.	positive
2067	570060128	education	5	"For learning brand new languages, Duolingo is by far THE BEST app you could ever hope for!! üëèüòç I am learning Japanese, which I have dreamed of learning for as long as I can remember, and now it's coming true!!! üò±
 But why I don't give the 5 stars is that the 'Placement Test' does not give accurate results. English is my first language, and I was in French Immersion from age 5 to age 11(SEVEN years) I consider myself bilingual but because its been awhile since elementary school i forgot a lot. But I still don't speak the language fluently. So I thought I'd use Duolingo to strengthen my knowledge and vocabulary of the language. I took the Placement Test and according to Duolingo I am only 32% fluent in FRENCH!  It treats me like I've just begun learning the language >:( I also took the placement test for Spanish which I studied for only ONE year, and Duolingo claims I am 26% fluent! This just isn't logical. 7 years of studying a language vs 1 year is OBVIOUSLY very different! Not an 8% difference üòï
But don't forget I do think Duolingo is FANTASTIC for brand-new language learners üòÉ üåè As I said with my Japanese learning ;)) I am in no way trying to diss Duolingo, I'd just like to see some improvement in the Placement Test, allowing intermediate/advanced learners truly begin Duolingo where they stand. 
Thanks to anyone who read my rant üòá

2068	570060128	education	4	"Duolingo is really helping me! The only unfortunate thing is that it will never, and exactly n e v e r make you fluent. It mostly teaches you what you NEED to know. Like Vowels, Letters, Greetings; stuff like that. It won‚Äôt make you fluent, especially since studies say you need fluent speakers around you to BE fluent, but it is helping me read some stuff. 
  I recommend it! It makes language learning fun, and actually feels kinda sorta like a game. The art style is cute as heck, and Duo really makes you want to learn ( especially by giving helpful reminders) 
 Now the only important thing you can do, Is actually study. Now I know a lot of you aren‚Äôt that dumb to believe ‚Äúyou can learn a language by studying 5 minutes a day!‚Äù But in all words, study at least 40 minutes to actually learn something, and keep that daily streak- not just for fun, but for learning reasons.... If you keep it up, you probably be a good ( but not at all fluent) Language Learner! It really depends on you. 
 Summing it all up, Duolingo is really helpful! Making things fun sure does help, but understand it‚Äôs not all that and a bag of potato chips. You need to LEARN, but even if you do make that a rule in your life, it‚Äôs not gonna completely solve your language problemos. I‚Äôd give it a 4/5 for teaching you the language pretty well, making it a priority, and it being fun. 
 (And we must not forget that Duo is making that a priority..)"	positive
2069	570060128	education	3	My first language I learned was Romanian. I am half Romanian, and my mother and grandmother and other relatives speak it. I can understand Romanian, but I never learned how to speak or write it. I decided to try the app. The app works fine, it is pretty smoothly running. However, if I make a simple grammatical mistake that can be pointed out, the hearts run out. I think the hearts should be taken off, after all; how is someone supposed to learn with them suddenly not being aloud to because of mistakes they could have learned from? I have found I can now read in Romanian a little bit, this pleases me. But I came to the app because I wanted to be able to speak it, not read. That was another thing. And because I was illiterate at the beginning, I couldn‚Äôt do the test. I‚Äôve had to work up from the beginning, and it‚Äôs become a real chore. I wish the hearts system was dealt with, and there was a better way of being able to learn for the app. (Also, I tried learning Russian, I believe that they should teach the alphabet, as I can‚Äôt read it. And most people just learning a language won‚Äôt be able to either.) overall, this app needs real work, but it improved me slightly. I can talk to my grandma a small bit in Romanian, but I‚Äôve found just asking my mom for words works better. Please improve in these aspects. It can teach simple grammar and language, just don‚Äôt expect to be able to be anywhere close to fluent.	positive
2070	570060128	education	4	This app is so great -  It‚Äôs fun while you learn! However, I do wish that you could skip levels by taking the proficiency test (without paying/enrolling in PLUS).  Not an issue for beginners, but for upper intermediate it feels like slogging through a lot of elementary language learning to get to the complex grammar and vocabulary, such as use of the subjunctive - not only for the present but also the past, etc..  Also, I really wish they had a phonetic (peh o jie or other) TAIWANESE module for Western speakers who do NOT know Chinese characters.  There are almost no methods in existence (anymore) to learn Taiwanese (tai-gi) without first having to learn Mandarin or at least Chinese characters; even though the words and tones are TOTALLY different (mutually unintelligible).??? I just want to SPEAK and understand Taiwanese first, so that I can speak more of it with my in-laws in conversation.  Learning/writing characters would be more for educational use (You don‚Äôt even need to read directions via Chinese characters, as almost all roadsigns are in English as well as traditional Chinese characters who is present. And the old war-time Bodmann (?sp) material is not relevant for modern use, and the audio-tapes are virtually non-existent now.  I know of only one newer English/Taiwanese written book, and it‚Äôs hard to get outside of Taiwan.  And I believe there is no audio component for that new book.  Duo-lingo, please listen!!	positive
2071	570060128	education	4	"I love the idea and practicality of this app. The amount of languages available and how you utilized learning these languages is really remarkable. If you added more dynamics in immersive learning this app would be amazing. However, I‚Äôm experiencing some difficulties with using your app that‚Äôs severely hindering me from learning the language. One, if your going to teach a language make sure the building blocks that you‚Äôre using for the language are all there. I‚Äôm currently trying to learn Japanese and your skipping through so many characters in hiragana. Then, before I even grasp hiragana you throw katakana in the mix using actual words with those characters before teaching the characters themselves. Your program is so sporadic and because of this it‚Äôs crippling my future progress. And two, your lessons. Five levels of doing the same exact thing, not fun at all, or productive. Level one should be teaching the new material. As the learner progresses by going up in level, old material should be thrown into the mix subtly with each level. Then, by level 5 you‚Äôre doing it all. You‚Äôve not only learned the new material but established the old material as well...

I just see a lot of potential in this app but it feels like you've bit off more than you can chew with all these languages. If Japanese has such a sporadic program how many others are the same way."	positive
2072	570060128	education	4	Duolingo provides a great learning system, although it is a bit difficult to learn a completely new language. I am learning German, and have been for a few months on Duolingo, but starting off was a bit difficult. Yes the app gave you definitions for words, but it didn‚Äôt really give you how you should use the word. For example; it didn‚Äôt provide which variation of ‚Äòthe‚Äô would be used for feminine, masculine or neutral classification. The only other problem are the ‚Äòlives.‚Äô When I had originally downloaded Duolingo, I could practice for nearly half an hour, yes I would make mistakes, but it still provided a learning experience and allowed me to continue despite these mistakes. The ‚Äòlife‚Äô system is prompting you not to continue with your practice, which can be discouraging. The wait time for even on of the five lives is very lengthy, and I don‚Äôt want to wait such a long time just to make a simple error and have to restart my lesson the next day. Other than these two problems, Duolingo is an exceptional app that allows for in-depth learning, with lessons that include not only reading, but pronouncing the language, and conversing with others. The streak keeps you from skipping practicing, and gives you motivation. Altogether, Duolingo is a great app, not to mention it‚Äôs free, which is a plus considering it‚Äôs competition, and it‚Äôs content.	positive
2073	570060128	education	5	"I love this app and have been using it daily for over 4 years. The most recent overhaul is fantastic, even though I didn‚Äôt fully appreciate it at first. For me, at least two years of new content was added. For a volunteer supported app, that effort was incredible. I love the quiz and test out features and the progression of difficulty in the exercises.

My criticisms are minor, but in theory should be easily fixable (says the non-programmer). I can‚Äôt figure out how to give feedback along the way so there is the ability to fix quickly. It seems like you can only report a correct or wrong answer but no other feedback. So here it is-there are times where none of the  word choices that are given as hints for an answer are accepted as correct. It seems like there should be a correlation loop between the correct answers and the suggested answers. There are times in the same exercise where the answers are conflicting and no way to report that. Also it took me forever to figure out how to renew my Plus subscription. I would love to have access to a ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù field in the app for all devices that would offer options like: membership, report error, q&a (general and by topic section and chapter).

To all the folks who have given their time and talent to developing and supporting this app, merci beaucoup √† tous!"	positive
2074	570060128	education	4	"The majority of the functions on this app are great! I love using it and it motivates me to learn. It makes learning a new language fun and simple and is free with very few ads.   Honestly, the only things I don‚Äôt like are the number of emails I get saying to practice, upgrade to the paid version, and get the company‚Äôs other apps. I tried switching emails off in the app‚Äò store settings but it didn‚Äôt work... plus, sometimes I forget to check my email, causing these emails to pile up and me to miss important notifications that get buried under them.
The other thing I don‚Äôt like is the submit button. It is big and right next to the delete button so sometimes I will be typing or deleting a mistake and will accidentally submit my answer. On a skill test, this can cause me to fail. There is a ‚Äúreport problem‚Äù button, but it doesn‚Äôt have an ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt done‚Äù option. It should have one. I understand people could cheat on the skill tests this way, but that could be avoided by not counting the question as a question if it was marked that way, instead ignoring it and adding another question.
So I know I mostly just complained, but Duolingo is actually a great app and if it weren‚Äôt for these small problems it would be perfect. It is a great way of learning a language and everyone should use it. Plus, it‚Äôs free and there are barely any adds:)"	positive
2075	570060128	education	3	I‚Äôm really only sticking with this app because I‚Äôve gotten so far and I don‚Äôt want to start over with another app. I am using it to learn Russian (with no Russian background). It doesn‚Äôt teach you the alphabet. I had to use another website just to learn what each letter was supposed to sound like. There are no instructions for how to pronounce the words. There is not guidance about grammar and when you get something wrong, there is no explanation as to how or why you were wrong (it just shows you the right answer). The only helpful thing is that plenty of people seem to have the same issues, so you can click the comments section and see conversations people have had discussing why certain answers didn‚Äôt work (often with native speakers saying the app is wrong, and that the answer should have been accepted). I‚Äôm using it along with a better website I have found. I also wish it had things like vocabulary lists you could study, rather than just the repetitive lessons that don‚Äôt allow you to tailor your studying to words with which you have more difficulty remembering. For example, ‚Äú–¥–µ–≤–æ—á–∫–∞‚Äù (girl) is a word I kept forgetting how to spell, but it rarely came up, so I just kept getting it wrong. ‚Äú–ú–æ—Ç–æ—Ä‚Äù (Motor) came up 100 times, which was frustrating because I knew that one by heart pretty quickly. If I had the option to study a list of words I commonly forgot, I feel I could improve faster.	negative
2076	570060128	education	5	The language I‚Äôm learning is French. I‚Äôve used other language learning apps(Mondly, Babbel) at the same time as a comparison to see which one was the simplest to use, which one taught me the fastest, which one was the the most user friendly, which one allowed me to learn for free(not just a teaser) which one allowed me at my skill level to continue to learn without overwhelming me with advanced practice sessions. Duolingo by far best out the competition in all of the above. Mondly is good but requires you to be more advanced from the start. Babbel is very limited until you start to pay. Duolingo is as advertised, mostly free, very enjoyable to use, definitely teaches you through repetition and introducing you to new sounds and rules of the language you are learning at the correct pace. Only thing I didn‚Äôt like is since the update a little while ago is that they introduced cartoon characters (people and animals) with speech bubbles, showing a religious person (male and female Muslim). I would rather it stay neutral and use cartoon animals. Religious categories have no place in a language app. (I don‚Äôt want to see a priest or Buddhist monk either) If it bothered me, I‚Äôm sure others are bothered too. And I know some people will be shocked that I commented on this, hence why I say, keep the cartoons to something neutral like animals	positive
2077	570060128	education	3	Great app and great concept. It would be nice if instead of always saying a sentence in Spanish and having us type the answer in Spanish, having just type the English translation instead. So we get in the habit of translating back-and-forth if that makes sense. Also it would be GREAT to be able to turn off the written version of the spoken language and just listening and translating. There isn‚Äôt a transcript in real life. I want it to be more challenging or at least the option. The lessons become very repetitive though. Charging 400 coins to skip is GREEDY when you give like 5 a day for meeting your goal. That would mean it would take about three months to gain as many coins as it takes to skip. How convenient when you charge for coins? Also the ‚Äúpractice‚Äùhealth option when you run out is supposed to test you on weak skills but it throws in word you NEVER learned. For example I‚Äôm in the clothing section for Spanish, before the people section which i assume has feelings, and they asked me the words for tired and fun. I have neither learned either. How is that practice??? and Also sometimes you recognize typos and sometimes you don‚Äôt. . The conversation feature is AMAZING but putting it directly between level one and zero is highly frustrating. Have me do the conversation once i learn the words, at the end of the module. Have a conversation with words i don‚Äôt know does nothing but confuse me.	positive
2078	570060128	education	5	"...and it‚Äôs GREAT! 
They start you off learning to read, letter by letter, sound by sound until you can recognize the most common ones. They have you practice with made-up words from basic sound combinations, introducing more and more sounds at your pace. Then they sneak in real words, and before you know it, you‚Äôre translating whole sentences and it suddenly dawns on you that, yes, I can read that, and no, it‚Äôs not as hard as I thought it would be! I‚Äôm absolutely stoked to study Arabic with Duolingo every day. The reward system is a bit of a joke, unfortunately, but the learning process itself is fun enough that you don‚Äôt need it to keep you motivated. It‚Äôs fun, I love it, and if you haven‚Äôt tried it, give it a go. I‚Äôve gone through all they have on Spanish as well and it‚Äôs really, really good, especially for beginners. 
If you‚Äôre not a beginner and just need to brush up, it‚Äôs good for you too. You can take the test and it‚Äôll place you as far along in the course as it thinks you should be, and then you can choose which lessons you want to brush up on. 
There are a lot of ads, but I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôre not getting the funding they need in other ways, and it‚Äôs a free app, so it makes sense. You‚Äôll have to skip through them after every lesson, but it‚Äôs not ridiculous."	positive
2079	570060128	education	5	"I decided to learn Spanish because I wanted to learn how to sign in Mexican Sign Language (LSM) and the book I bought was written in Spanish. It was so much easier than I thought it would be. There are different ways to pick up new vocabulary, match up words to make translations and more. Feels like a game. In a few months I could test out for the most rounds and am now learning the tenses. Then I started playing around with Hebrew. Boy, now that‚Äôs really hard! I‚Äôve never tried learning an language with a syllabary instead of an alphabet. Duolingo isn‚Äôt really helpful with comparisons or explanations on the app and according to other reviews it‚Äôs better on the web. I saw descriptions when I was playing on the Spanish side. But now when on the Hebrew part I wish I could back up to compare the words and their structure. I‚Äôll check out the web side and see if that‚Äôs better.  But it‚Äôs free and it‚Äôs fun! Makes me feel smarter. Thanks Duolingo.

Edit: one thing that annoys me about Duolingo is the notifications. The one that says: ‚Äúthose notifications don‚Äôt see to be working we will stop sending them for now‚Äù. Oh please. I‚Äôm on a 25 day streak and I‚Äôm still getting that message? It would make more sense if someone doesn‚Äôt log in for 7 days in a row to get that kind of message."	positive
2080	570060128	education	2	I used to use the Duolingo app as an excellent resource for learning new languages. I speak three languages and have always found the app to really reinforce any new language I was trying to pick up - that is, until the new update. The update has turned Duolingo into much more of a game where you are penalized for making any sort of mistakes (a vital part of the learning process) by losing health. Once your health is gone, you can‚Äôt continue on any further lessons unless you spend 20 extra minutes recovering or paying for it. This is obviously a way to up the profitability of the app, but takes away the ability to make ANY mistakes while learning a new language. Furthermore, only on the desktop version are explanations available for ANYTHING. As adults (I‚Äôm assuming the majority of people using this app are older than 16) we are unable to pick up languages the same way children are able to, i.e. listen and repeat words and phrases and absorb the language structure along the way. Any person with a little bit of knowledge on language acquisition or pedagogy knows this. After puberty you simply cannot pickup a language this way with absolutely no explanation. Go check out other (free) apps that offer very similar content but better quality. I‚Äôm hoping there will be enough of a revolt that Duolingo will revert back, as it really was a good app. Honestly just burn it down and start over again. Down with the system!!	positive
2081	570060128	education	3	"I do like this app and I really like learning Spanish in it. It works great and I love the length of the lessons. They are very convenient because I don‚Äôt always have much time but I can get these done. I would give this app more stars except for that I met my daily goal yesterday but today when I went on it said I didn‚Äôt. I lost all of the progress I made yesterday also, which was very disappointing considering I did quite a few lessons. I also have ‚Äúhealth‚Äù on my Duolingo app, but my mom who also has the app doesn‚Äôt. I want to get rid of the health section. Please help restore my 19 day streak and the progress I made yesterday. 

I am studying Spanish on Duolingo currently. The reason I dislike the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù so much on mine is because very often I will put an answer down, but the app will mark it wrong and then tell me the correct answer is exactly what I clicked on or wrote down. I will then lose health for a mistake the app made and not something I did. This makes me upset because then I can‚Äôt move on to the next lesson when it takes my health away.  

I would also appreciate it if there was more variety in the content. I have been learning Spanish for a while now and it asks me the same basic questions over and over. It was wonderful at the beginning but I am now starting to wish there was more useful thing that you would learn how to say."	positive
2082	570060128	education	5	"Note to language learners: I have wanted to learn Spanish for a long time and now, after discovering Duolingo, I am making some good headway. Duolingo is a great way to build vocabulary. It really helps to talk with someone in the language you are learning because it helps you remember the lesson a lot better. Duolingo has a ton of languages to choose from which is a big plus. One downside is the commercials. They don‚Äôt pop up during the lesson, but they often come up other times. I understand that they couldn‚Äôt make Duolingo free without commercials, so I gave it five stars. If you answer incorrectly too many times, you loose all your life and need to wait or watch a commercial. This can get a little annoying. The publishers made Duolingo so fun yet still effective it is like a game and it is addictive. Hopefully this review helps you get Duolingo. I definitely recommend it.üòä 
Note to publishers: I love what you have done with this app. I suggest that you add a wordlist feature, so every time you learn a new word, it adds it to the list. I know this would be incredibly helpful for me and other serious language learners. After a while, it is hard to keep track of all the words. This would be a great update. Thank you for taking time to read this. üòÅ"	positive
2083	570060128	education	5	"I am extremely reluctant to do anything past free versions but I LOOOOVE the pro version. I quit a few times when the free version was all I used because language is meant to connect people and learning it felt isolating. I am using the pro version and it can be the best part of my day. I feel accomplished after completing a tutoring session because they don‚Äôt just let you get something wrong and tell you. They are interactive so they pause, give you a chance to change it, and explain the reason it was wrong if you need it. They‚Äôre really responsive and a lot of times it seems like if they think you need more of a challenge, they will ask follow up questions which is what I need to want to keep engaging with it. 

For a while when I used it, it was very scripted but as I have gotten better, the last few days the tutors have been more interactive even in the beginning tutoring sessions. One asked a few follow up questions and it made my day. I love that I am speaking with native speakers from many different countries as opposed to one because I am seeing how it shifts a bit and is a living language. 

They are very, very friendly and a delight to work with. The pro version is so much more motivating if you can afford it."	positive
2084	570060128	education	5	"I am learning Spanish for work, and I use this app every single day. I love that it's so convenient. I can practice anywhere. I also love their streak system, which keeps me motivated to keep practicing every day. I also love that they have the learning meters for each module that get low after a while, which is a good guide for when to go practice those modules again. 

I have a couple requests. First, it's a little too easy. I wish there was more scenarios where you show an English sentence and I have to write a Spanish sentence. I think the reason that these are limited is because there are so many possibilities for a translation and it's hard to cover all of them. Also, I want a tool that allows me to practice while driving. Essentially, say a phrase in English and repeat in Spanish. It would simply be a nice way of practicing. It wouldn't even need to be graded. Finally, the course seems too short. I wish it was longer. 

Ultimately, to really be fluent, you need to practice with real people, so this app is not going to make you fluent by itself. However, it is a great, convenient tool, and can be a big help for someone learning a language. It's especially awesome that it's free! Normally I wouldn't go 5 stars, but since it's free, I think it should be 5 stars."	positive
2085	570060128	education	4	I really like languages and I‚Äôve been trying to learn Japanese by myself and this app has been very helpful but I think some improvements can be made. For Asian languages like Korean and Japanese learning the brush stokes and writing the symbols would be very helpful, I've used apps before that taught how to write but overall they weren‚Äôt as organized as this one but it really helped me to remember the hiragana. Also the gem idea really annoys me because all you can do with it is buy more health or use only fifty and then get one hundred if you keep your streak for a week-I know that some people use a lot of gems on health but I personally prefer to practice because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing with the health anyway- I currently have over 1,000 gems because I don‚Äôt have a reason to use them and I believe the gem system was created to give people something to earn but if what you earn is useless what‚Äôs the point? I think that having an avatar or something similar to that where you can buy things to make it unique is a great motivation for younger kids and older people as well. I personally struggle with having the motivation to do things and I honestly don‚Äôt use this app as much as I wish I did for that very reason.(This was my first review so I‚Äôm sorry if I make no sense and was a waste of your time)	positive
2086	570060128	education	3	"I do. I promise. And I like a lot of the changes they've made. However, in the German review section they only use at most ten different sentences for review, which is really unfortunate because I feel no need to actually learn (or review, in my case) anything. I just have to memorize the right answer when I get it wrong and then when the (exact same) sentence inevitably rolls around again toward the end of the lesson I just put in the right answer. I could understand if this were the case in the early lessons when there are so few words to work with, but this is a consistent problem even half-way through the available lessons. 

It's really disappointing and I feel like I'm kind of wasting my time which is sad because this is still the best free language app I've come across (as long as you search out some supplemental grammar material if you want to know the whys and howcomes).

I want to update this review to add that I‚Äôve finished testing out of all of the German lessons and feel like I know less now than when I started. I think the major problem for me is that an estimated 70% of the review questions test your vocab with no context, and that is basically the worst way to learn a language. I really, really hope they get their act together because at the moment I can‚Äôt honestly recommend the German portion of this app to anyone actually wanting to learn the language."	negative
2087	570060128	education	4	"I‚Äôve been a fan of duolingo for a few years now. They introduce new vocabulary that requires you to use all senses (except touch and taste of course), which is always a plus for learning. They give you visuals, listening exercises, and speaking. 

However, I‚Äôve noticed that with Japanese, they don‚Äôt do very well with teaching the alphabet. Yes, they do teach you, but it feels scrambled. I was able to easily go through the hiragana lessons because I‚Äôve studied it beforehand and already knew how to pronounce each syllable. Duolingo doesn‚Äôt teach you that each letter has basically the same sound so that you won‚Äôt be confused later. For example, the ‚Äòu‚Äô will always sound like the u in ‚ÄúJupiter‚Äù. They also fail to mention that each character in the alphabet is built off the vowels, A E I O U, by adding a letter in front of the vowel (ex. Ka, Ki, Ku, Ke, Ko). Having such information would make learning Hiragana a thousand times easier and would make you feel like you actually understand the alphabet. 

Given, I‚Äôm still on the first part of the lessons (they have four different lessons for hiragana; I‚Äôm on the last), so hopefully it does get better, especially in giving context and actually giving me grammar that I can use! I will update the further I go :) (is that possible? I hope so)"	positive
2088	570060128	education	4	I‚Äôve have used this app for a while now (on and offü§™). This is an amazing app, perfect for learners like me! I recommend this app to everyone how tells me they want to learn a language. A close friend who is a fluent Spanish speaker/teacher (with a masters degree in it) even says its a great app for anyone. The one thing that does not satisfy me is that (awhile back or something) you had Bots you could ‚Äúchat with‚Äù. This was VERY helpful for me since I could ‚Äútalk/text‚Äù with the computer and practice using everyday conversations. It would be AWESOME if you could please add the Chat Bots back! Those seriously help with learning and remembering words/conversations. The ‚ÄúClubChat, Caption This, Use This Word, etc...‚Äù are good, but from me (I‚Äôm still a beginner) is that there are a bunch of people on different levels. This means that your ClubChat has different people speaking on different levels of Spanish (or any other language), unlike the ChatBots, who speak on your level (since it‚Äôs a computer) and if you haven‚Äôt learned the word yet it has those little dots underneath to click and it tells you what it means. And they‚Äôll give you sample sentences to respond back with if you‚Äôre stumped. Thank you so much! If you could get back with me about if the BotChat could be added back that would be much appreciated! Hope to see it soon!!!!!‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è	positive
2089	570060128	education	3	"Let me start off by saying that I love Duolingo and it was one of the first language learning apps that I ever used, but it does have its flaws like any other app. When I started using Duolingo, I was using it for French. Learning French is great, and it really helped me when I joined into my French 1 class half way through the year; however, when it comes to other languages that are more sound based (?), it lacks certain things. 

I have recently found an interest in Korean culture, so I immediately wanted to learn some of the basic language. The first app that I went to was Duolingo, but as I went on, I got confused and had trouble remembering things. Typically, I don‚Äôt forget things ‚Äî especially with languages, so I knew something about Duolingo was a little bit different. Once I had completed the alphabet, I moved onto learning some words, but the word ‚ÄúHyundai‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to help me if I visit Korea. I won‚Äôt go around and be like ‚ÄúÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî ÌòÑÎåÄ‚Äù because that would be weird. So, the first words you learn should be more like ‚ÄúÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî‚Äù, ‚ÄúÍ≥†ÎßàÏõåÏöî‚Äù, and ‚ÄúÎ∂ÄÌÉÅÌï©ÎãàÎã§‚Äù, in my opinion. Even so, Duolingo is still a good app, but I would not recommend it for Korean, Chinese, and Japanese. I use Memrise for Korean vocabulary, practice, etc. And I use Hello Talk and LingoDeer for other practice. Hopefully, this review was helpful, and in no way, shape, or form am I trying to hate on the company."	positive
2090	570060128	education	5	I first started using Duolingo when my friend told me that I should learn French so that we could have private conversations together. They told me that they self taught themselves using this duolingo app. So I downloaded it and was immediately blown away by not only the fact that they have Hawaiian and Navajo but also have a FAKE language from Star Trek. I was laughing my head off. But once I actually started it was great. The app is great because it uses multiple different teaching methods like typing the phrases(both doing French to English and English to French), saying the words into your phone, iPad, any device your using, and choosing which word is correct after listening to the word in the opposite language. Also people complaining about the whole life system is bull crap. The hearts thing is just a system to get you to do an extra challenge that focuses your weak spots to get an extra heart which is so nice. Sometimes I‚Äôll be on a lesson and I am just hardcore struggling so I‚Äôll jump over to the heart challenge even if I have max hearts and I‚Äôll just work there since it challenges the words you miss the most. Overall this app is soooo helpful, free, and easy to operate. I would highly recommend getting it if your interested in a new language	positive
2091	570060128	education	4	"The issues below have been resolved to my satisfaction. However, Duolingo's customer service needs to be more responsive. I plan to sign up again for Duolingo plus -- and hope that the process will work without problems this time -- because I wish to support a company that offers an innovative  product that served as the main source of my language learning over the years. Support from long-term users might make it possible to dispense with the health wheel, purchase of gems, and other approaches of questionable educational value. 

--------------------------

I signed up for Duolingo plus, as I have used the free versions of the app for many years and the company is in need of additional revenue.  Regrettably, three weeks later, I still don't have the benefit of the promised extra features. My many attempts to resolve the issue via email have failed, as the responses are usually form messages asking for information that I had previously supplied several times.  To be fair, there was one human (versus a robot) response alluding to compatibility issues with iOS which the company was trying to resolve. If this is the case, I t is inexcusable that it continues to advertise Duolingo plus without first  resolving these issues.  I have twice requested a refund, but don't expect to get one."	positive
2092	570060128	education	4	Duolingo is an app that, for its free tag and excellent design in most areas, is severely underrated. The gift of being able to learn other languages (and more in some cases) is priceless. The subscription service it provides, while a bit pricey for what it offers, is also a good way to allow users to support the app and give some benefits. I cant agree with some of the things it gives comparable to the free version as it, at times, seems to go contrary to its learning objective. This, however, is fine. What I mainly dislike is the streak system as opposed to a ‚Äòtotal number of days‚Äô studied sort of thing. And with the cost of repairing a streak being unnecessarily high, it just seems like trying to squeeze out as much money from someone who may have had a busy couple of days. Streak freezes costing  so much is hardly a problem, but not being protected from at least 2-3 days of not practicing is a bit harsh. I‚Äôve payed for maybe 4-5 months of premium in my usage of the app and I think theyd just be better off offering a noneducational-content related way of supporting them for some kind of in-app flair or something. I don‚Äôt remember their stance on (or if they had one) on merchandizing but id personally love to support them in such a way. In conclusion, do download this app! ;3	positive
2093	570060128	education	3	To whoever is in charge with this app, I would like to say that I am upset at the fact that I can‚Äôt sign in for some reason. I have used this app before a couple years ago but stopped using it. I have now created a new account about half a month ago. I have been using it everyday and have a streak of about maybe 17. I used the app earlier in the day yesterday like I have been, and then I went to use it again before I went to sleep. However, for some reason last night it said that it was unable to sign me in and to try again later. So I left it be, seeing as I had already completed my lessons for the day anyway. I went to use it again three times today and every single time it told me the same thing. I am now very upset because 1) I can‚Äôt use the app for its sole purpose of learning a language 2) I am going to lose my streak. I‚Äôm sure that I am just an inconvenience, but as a person who originally really liked this app, it is upsetting that I can‚Äôt use it because it won‚Äôt let me sign in. I have the right password. It doesn‚Äôt tell me that I have an incorrect password nor does it tell me what is wrong. It just simply tells me that it can‚Äôt sign me in and to try again later. If I wanted ‚Äútry again later‚Äù as a response I‚Äôd get a magic eight ball. I want to be able to use this app instead of getting frustrated.	negative
2094	570060128	education	3	"TLDR: Duolingo is a good app but it‚Äôs not ideal. If you‚Äôre looking to actually LEARN Spanish I suggest taking each course multiple times or get another app. To get my full opinion and overview of the app please read the rest.

It‚Äôs not a bad app, really. However, it‚Äôs not very useful if you‚Äôre really trying to memorize the Spanish words and actually remember them.
I‚Äôve finished and repeated lessons multiple times and, honestly, I‚Äôve forgotten most of it. Learning Spanish involves learning unit after unit, (not referring to the different lessons), and practicing them over and over again. To be more precise: you don‚Äôt just have a bunch of different words in one lesson and expect to remember them all, you type bread in Spanish, milk in Spanish and so on multiple times right? And then you remember what they are for about 1 day and then forget. What I‚Äôm saying is it involves repetition, chunks and actual conversations instead of random words. Like learning female and male words in Spanish. Example: La VS El. El se√±or VS La se√±orita. You get it and you should, being you‚Äôre teaching Spanish on this app. Though, I do understand this is FREE and that‚Äôs why I DO NOT suggest buying Duolingo Plus, (although it has some more helpful features). This is basically the best trash you can get and it may be helpful for side practices or other small things. I hope this review was somewhat helpful, thanks for your time."	positive
2095	570060128	education	4	I hate what you‚Äôre doing with the new point system. With the exception of the very first few lessons, you move so fast through everything else, and I don‚Äôt want to move on until I actually know and understand the material. It used to be that a user would get 10 points no matter what lesson they did. Now, if you‚Äôre reviewing passed lessons, you get 10 for the first lesson, and five for the second, and none for anything afterwards (per category). I don‚Äôt always have time to do more than two lessons per day-which has been my goal since I downloaded this app about a year ago. Two lessons were enough to get me done for the day, and as a single mother, I can easily fit this in at any random time. Now, I need more like double that. I enjoyed the competition at first. Now it makes me feel like a failure constantly just because I don‚Äôt have that much time on my hands like other users do. I like how I can see what other people are learning. But what‚Äôs the point of following someone if you can‚Äôt interact with them? It‚Äôs completely pointless. It used to be that I used the app to actually learn language, now it‚Äôs just like any other game app that good for nothing but earning points. What‚Äôs with using earned gems to buy outfits for the owl?? Who cares! That‚Äôs not what the app is for!!!	positive
2096	570060128	education	5	"If you‚Äôre trying to learn a language online with little to no research, this is the place to do it. I‚Äôve always been a fan of duolingo and recommend it to anyone trying to learn a new language. It‚Äôs streamlined, easy, and beautifully simple. They make learning into a game and send small encouraging messages when you‚Äôre doing well. They have  5 second ads at the end of each lesson, which is a small price to pay for the amount you get out of this app. You can always pay to remove ads along with other perks, which unfortunately I can‚Äôt afford at the moment. But if I had money to I definitely would just to give back to duolingo for all they have given me. Anyway, sorry for the fangirling over an app, I just seriously like it. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.

Edit: It also might help to know that I have an app without any health, I‚Äôm not exactly sure why but my app is different than anybody I know that has downloaded it recently. I read that it has something to do with duolingo constantly doing a sort a beta testing to make the best learning platform they can, but I can‚Äôt be sure that‚Äôs true. I personally think that not having health improves my learning than if I were to have health."	positive
2097	570060128	education	2	"Every time we travel I try to review my language skills so I can at least be somewhat conversant with people. Duolingo is by far the most fun, easy to use program I have tried. The excercises move quickly and build in a logical manner. There isn't much explanation, but figuring things out for myself helps me to remember better.  I had very low expectations from a free app, but duolingo is actually a great tool for learning and reviewing.

UPDATE:  I have loved Duolingo and have been very diligent about my daily French lessons. After about a year of practice I am reading simple books and able to understand a surprising amount of dialogue in French movies.  Unfortunately they have now introduced Crown Levels. The app has gone from fun and engaging to tedious and frustrating. The amount of repetition required to advance a crown level is ridiculous. And the required answers have become too rigid. For instance ‚Äúpain‚Äù can no longer be answered ‚Äúbread‚Äù. The correct answer is now ‚Äúa loaf of bread‚Äù. Today I lost a health point for saying that ‚Äúchat‚Äù is ‚Äúcat‚Äù and not ‚Äúmale cat‚Äù. Adding to the frustration is the new policy of deducting a health point for every wrong answer. Changing the accepted answer without notice used to be annoying. Now it can cause me to ‚Äúfoul out‚Äù and have to stop lessons for the day before reaching my goal. If I wanted endless repetition and pedantic teaching I would go take a class."	positive

And when a company dishonors that trust by taking your money but then not providing the services or goods promised, most people would consider it fraud. Priceline took payment for airline tickets and then refused to refund that payment when the flights were cancelled. Seems like an easy response by a respectable company to send the money back, especially since it was no fault of the customer that the service wasn‚Äôt provided, but Priceline has chosen to keep the money. They claim it‚Äôs because of the Coronavirus and a lack of employees to provide the refund. There are literally tens of millions of newly unemployed people that could be accomplishing the job Priceline refuses to complete. You can use this app and pray things go well and you are provided the service you‚Äôve paid for, but know that when things don‚Äôt go right, and sometimes they don‚Äôt, Priceline will not respect you and honor the trust you‚Äôve placed in them by sending them your money. You‚Äôll be gambling your money on a company with no honor.

Priceline has since asked to ‚Äúrevisit my case for review,‚Äù standard response to make it look like it cares. I HAVE CALLED DOZENS OF TIMES TO REVISIT MY CASE! The only thing Priceline should be reviewing, is how it treats customers. Refund the money you owe."	positive

On more than one occasion Priceline has had deals on there website and app that are not actually available, yet they they have charged my card leaving me with nothing now I have to wait 8-15 business days for my refund to be processed. Not only have they blamed me for not using a credit card next they blame the bank and I will be seeing my money back to me in enough time when all reality they need to take responsibility and update her apps they don‚Äôt have offers that are outdated. Not only will they Blame you for using a debit card but they will also blame your bank or the hotel before even beginning to take responsibility. When ever I have called there costumer service, they just blame blame blame, and do nothing to fix the situation or make it better, THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THERE CLIENTS.

2102	336381998	travel	1	I have used Priceline regularly for the last few years, booking hotel rooms through them several times a month. When there are no issues, they‚Äôre great, but the times there are issues make it unbearable. I booked a hotel using the app based on it being in a specific location, and being able to get a suite with a kitchenette at a great price. Once I received the confirmation, I realized that the hotel was located approx 20 miles away from where they showed on the map, and I had a reservation for a standard room. I was told by hotel employees that they had contacted Priceline several times regarding the incorrect information, but they had made no effort to change it. So after my family drove nearly an hour out of our way to stay in a room smaller than I had intended, I let customer service know about the incorrect information and requested a refund based on it. After a few communications with different CS reps, they have yet to acknowledge that the information was inaccurate, accept responsibility, compensate me for my inconvenience or correct the info on their site. They are intentionally deceiving their customers. Priceline‚Äôs entire purpose is to curate travel information to simplify the process for users. If I have to use other sites and apps to verify that their info is correct before using them, then they are useless to me.	negative

The room was dirty, body hair in the bathtub, stains throughout the rooms carpet, mold in the shower/tub gout and the hair dryer was broken. I emailed Priceline immediately when we got in the room, they didn't reply until a few days later. They replied that the hotel gave us free breakfast so that was the compensation accepted for the dissatisfaction for the room. The hotel text me asking if we were happy and I told her we weren't and explained the problems in the room, she text that she couldn't refund some of the room charge because we booked through a third party/Priceline so all she could offer is a free meal which we didn't use because it was a breakfast buffet at TGIF, gross. 
We spent with tax and fees over $300 for one night in a maybe 1 Star Holiday Inn when we were ""guaranteed"" a 3 star minimum room before bidding. For that money we could have stayed at a nice Disney resort which was the level we were expecting because of the 3 star minimum we paid for. Customer service was not willing to do anything to make this right so we will never be using Priceline again and will continue to tell everyone we can about how we got ripped off by Priceline."	positive

I alway check other sources for deals and I always find the best deals on PriceLine.  I have used it for business and personal vacations. But what made me actually write this review rather then just rate the app, was my recent experience with their customer service. In a rush to get a reservation done while sick and mildly medicated, I accidentally made the reservation for the wrong dates.  I needed it for a week later.  Once I realized my mistake, I called PriceLine directly from the app. The service rep (wish I could remember his name) was professional and friendly.  He contacted the hotel for me and confirmed that they could cancel the reservation for me (it was a special deal that was supposed to be non-refundable).  I received the cancellation notice seconds after getting off the phone. PriceLine went the extra mile for me, and that is why I am writing this review and gave them 5 stars. Thanks again PriceLine.	positive

I then asked if I could be refunded the money I bought the hotel room with so I could put it onto another card I could show the hotel, they copy and pasted the hotels refund and cancellation policy and ended the chat.	negative

I went through the process and selected the same hotel. Everything processed and a confirmation was sent. When I reviewed the confirmation it had the wrong date. The date booked was the same day that I was booking it instead of the next day. Also, I was booking this at 8 pm at the hotel. I called customer support instantly. They said they have to talk to the revenue manager at the hotel. Then I talked to the hotel and they said good luck Priceline screws everyone over period. I spent that evening and the entire next day trying to get it fixed. After hours and hours of frustration and talking to customer service that can barely speak English they said TOO BAD! Hmmm. So they are telling me because there is a glitch on their end that it is my problem. They said it was my fault because I used their website. This is unacceptable. After read all of the negative reviews I wish I read before use long this incompetent service that will rip you off. It was total BS! Do not use this app or website!	negative

-I booked a hotel using the Name Your Price feature in the app for what I thought was the following night because we were driving home from our trip the next day. It charges your card right away, so I assumed everything was alright. After hours of driving we got to our hotel (that I thought I booked for that night) and the less-than-friendly front desk attendant said our reservation was for the previous night. 
I double-checked my app, and sure enough, it was booked for the previous night. I was sure I entered the correct dates when I booked. I think there was a glitch in their app. 
When I called Priceline to see about a refund, they were sympathetic and said they thought it was funny that the app let me book the room after midnight. When the customer rep tried to call the hotel, the hotel wouldn‚Äôt answer. Priceline wouldn‚Äôt give me even a partial refund. 
How often does this happen? How much money is this company making off their app glitches? I wouldn‚Äôt use this app. I guess the old adage of talking to a person is best in this situation and I think that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll be doing in the future."	positive

Car Rental issues in August 2016 in McAlester, OK.   I don‚Äôt advise renting a car from Priceline.	positive

Contacted Priceline and they were happy to assist me in calling both Frontier  and Spirit Airlines and cancelling both round trip tickets while I was on hold.  I was sweating it out but they came through for me cancelling both non-refundable tickets.  I book through Priceline all the time and get the greatest deals after searching for a couple of days for flights that fit not only my budget, but also the times I want to go, plus non-stop.  Furthermore, I just booked a full size vehicle through the express deal for the price of a compact.  I checked out all other sites before and Priceline is the most reasonably priced, courteous customer care professionals, and most helpful of all the other sites.  If you do go through Priceline, and listen to me, you‚Äôll save time & money!

2112	336381998	travel	3	I have used this app a bit and mostly everything is great. The only problem I have had though was that when you filter for hotels that are pet friendly you shouldn‚Äôt get to the hotel and have to beg for them to let you stay. I took my dog on a road trip and the first stop was after 15 hours of driving. We were exhausted and ready to go to bed, but when we got there we had to beg them to let us stay which thankfully they made an exception since I was able to show them where the listing showed them as pet friendly. That was stressful, but I was willing to let it go and call it a fluke until it happened again the next evening on the next hotel stop. Fortunately the lady at the front desk also took pity on us and allowed us to stay, but we have to sneak her in and out to use the bathroom and leave the hotel so the other people who work here won‚Äôt know she‚Äôs here so again very stressful. Please make sure that if you are assigning a hotel to someone looking for pet friendly that it actually is pet friendly	positive
2113	336381998	travel	1	"I booked several times through them, and twice now they have failed to complete my reservations, I just had to pay twice at the same hotel, luckily the front desk ladies were nice enough to match the price, Priceline constantly gave me the run around after wasting an hour and a half, I finally just said enough, I‚Äôll let my bank deal with you jokers, not worth the time or effort, if you find a good deal online 9 times out of 10, show the hotel they will match it or come close. Delete this app.

To the developer who responded...

It wasn‚Äôt a rejection, your systems failed to correctly place me even after I paid, front desk said there was a woman waiting in her car all night because of the same issue, take better care of people that‚Äôs all I can say pal, I don‚Äôt use fakebook or any social media, so I will respectfully decline...on a side note, when I disputed the charge through my bank(since your people gave me the run around) my claims department said they get more disputes from Priceline than she has ever seen, so I‚Äôm sure you are well aware of your shortcomings, I have nothing left to say on the matter, good day."	positive
2114	336381998	travel	1	Chose to use PL due to name recognition although other discount sites were priced about the same. Round trip Delta to destination Spirit from destination. The app failed to reserve our seats on delta and we assigned the last four seats on the back row. While in route the app does not indicate boarding gate, but emails changes which for this trip changed twice. Atlanta airport is spread out, and we just happened to check departures and noticed 30 minutes before boarding that our gate had moved from A19 to F9. No email from PL...... until we were boarding. Day before returning we received an email to check in on Spirit Air tried several times to check in, but never received confirmation. While checking in we noticed that if you wait until your flight Spirit will charge extra for checked luggage which is $40 per bag(x3), then we were charged $16 per seat (x 4). As of two hours after ‚Äúchecking in‚Äù still had not received our boarding passes and seat confirmations. Flying Delta, Southwest or United would have cost about the same plus the apps for delta and United seem to work very welll. Do not trust the PL app if you do not fly regularly.	positive
2115	336381998	travel	2	"I have been a loyal Priceline user for well over 10 years. I probably book from 50 - 75 rooms per year and every time I book, I fear that something about my trip might change. Priceline is super inflexible. Actually, they are kind of Bi-polar with a heavy bent toward inflexibility. On a rare occasion, I have been able to reschedule a room, or cancel a trip that has been changed, but for the most part, if something changes about your trip, just plan on no refund, no changes. It‚Äôs kind of like playing Russian roulette, but with four bullets in the gun.

The other thing is that their prices used to beat anyone on the internet, and the bidding process worked wonderfully to get the best rate available. Recently, not so much. Prices are pretty much in line with almost every other company out there. So, if you like gambling with your money or if you are 100% sure nothing will change about your trip, then I would still use Priceline. But if there is even a small chance something might change, I would recommend someone else."	positive
2116	336381998	travel	1	"Whenever you have stayed at a hotel, the app gives you deals to stay again and again, but it doesn‚Äôt let you do anything but accept whatever room they may have available for that deal and not any other room! ‚ÄúRoom is guaranteed to accommodate 2 adults‚Äù. Ummm? So what about families? And WHY CAN‚ÄôT I BOOK A DIFFERENT ROOM?! If you select the ‚Äòchoose‚Äô button it takes you straight to a check out screen... great... I want to pick my room!! I need it to fit 5 and a lot of rooms don‚Äôt do that. I‚Äôm not just going to book. So I have to go to your website or better yet... NOT YOU. To book the room I want. 

Been like this for years... no one else complained?! I doubt it. Now your app is deleted, thank you for wasting my time yet again. Like the last time I paid for a whirlpool sweet and you just told the hotel I paid for a king and had to pay the hotel more money when I got there for it when I already paid you an extra fee over the regular king room for it. Sounds like it not uncommon and you are another apathetic business out there just waiting to scam others out of their money."	positive
2117	336381998	travel	1	"Oh if I could only give this app zero stars.
I had a terrible experience attempting to book my honeymoon, of all things, through the Priceline app. I was told time and time again the flight I chose was unavailable and sent back to choose another flight, when in actuality Priceline was attempting to charge my credit card. I received no confirmations, no emails telling me there was a problem, and I never even reached the final step of booking. It wasn‚Äôt until my credit card company contacted me that I was notified of any attempted card activity. Priceline customer service insisted that the generic error for the app is ‚Äúflight unavailable, choose another.‚Äù That alert was completely false in my case. I was assured all of the attempted charges would be wiped clean, but Priceline customer service said they could send no kind of email to confirm this information. 
I am incredibly disappointed and sad, because what should have been a joyous celebration booking a trip turned into a catastrophe. I have emailed Priceline once again to explain the entire situation and hopefully prevent this from happening to anyone else in the future."	negative
2118	336381998	travel	1	"Priceline used to be a great place to get great deals until recently. The Express Deals they offer seem to be a decent deal until you select one. First off, the hotels that they say are comparable to the one you‚Äôll be getting are actually nothing like the one you receive. I booked a 3 Star express deal that they said would be comparable to a  Marriot, Hilton or Hyatt and instead got a motel that I wouldn‚Äôt even rate over 2 stars. In addition to that, when I checked in, I was told I must pay an additional $34. Priceline had informed me at the bottom of the booking conditions in tiny print that there would in fact be a mandatory fee I would have to pay. My problem with this is why did they have to put it all the way at the bottom like they were hiding it and not put it some where people could actually see it right away so you know the true cost of what your paying for.
When looking at reviews for this hotel, no one had anything nice to say about it except that it was close to Universal. How it‚Äôs a 3 Star hotel is mystery to me. When calling customer service, they were unhelpful and made me even angrier."	positive
2119	336381998	travel	5	I've been using Priceline for 15 years. Express Deals are a great way to get into a moderate to fairly high end hotel for great prices!  I had 1 issue a few months ago. I had driven with moving truck to move my daughter into her apartment. I was focused on moving her and didn't make hotel reservation for me. Finally, at 11:50 pm, I'm making reservation from my phone. By the time all was confirmed, it was after midnight and the reservation had automatically changed from the Friday night I existed in to Saturday night with no way to change it back.  Done deal. I was exhausted from moving all day. I spent an hour and a half on the phone to the Philippines finally getting refunded but no place to stay Friday night. That sucked, but the hotel front desk gal (who got a raving review) offered me a blanket and pillow to stay on a couch in the lobby!!  Beware scheduling a reservation around the midnight hour!	negative
2120	336381998	travel	1	My husband and I booked a hotel through Priceline so that we could attend my nephews graduation. When we arrived to the hotel, we found bedbugs on our room(some alive/ some dead). We notified the hotel staff and they refused to refund our money because we booked through Priceline. When I was waiting in the parking lot, another woman approached me and let me know that she had just found live bedbugs in her room and advised me not to stay. We knew it was not an isolated event. So, we called Priceline. They informed us that because the hotel management denied that they had bedbugs and they were not there to check that they could not refund our money ( it was a multi-night stay) I asked if they had any customer protections within their contact for live infestations and they said that they could not refund our money because the management denied the problem. We travel frequently (my husband is a pilot) and we will never use Priceline again. Thankfully, we found another hotel (not through Priceline) and they gave us a discount for our troubles. Priceline works for the hotels - not for the customers!!!	negative
2121	336381998	travel	1	I have been a long time customer purchasing flights cars and hotels. I have always purchased the Trip cancellation insurance.  Never needed it until today.  Don‚Äôt do it folks it is a scam. The one time I finally need to change a flight and Priceline could not and would not help in any way. They sounded as if they were literally reading off a response card. I called several times hoping to get a customer service agent that would listen to the issue and try to help. Luckily I had insurance right??? One would think but wrong again. The only time the trip cancellation covers you is if you are on your death bed and in the hospital and even then you have to call them ASP in order to be covered. Very misleading. Don‚Äôt waste your money buy the better ticket if you think for a second you might have to make a change. Better yet purchase from the airline directly. Priceline told me yesterday they can‚Äôt help me they are only the middleman. Well time to cut out the middleman. Priceline you have lost a very good customer that purchases 10-20 flights a year, Hotels and rental cars.	negative
2122	336381998	travel	5	I have been using Priceline and services similar since their inception.  I am very grateful for the ease of use, the deals offered, and the constant improvements made.  No, everything doesn‚Äôt always go the way I expect it should go but it always works out.  Being a life long businessman and entrepreneur I can appreciate how much time, effort, and ingenuity go into the operations and service.  I am also very appreciative of the helpful and patient customer service agents when things don‚Äôt go as planned, I could not do your job!  For the people who post bad reviews for Priceline and other services like them,  it might be worth lowering your expectations and look for the positive aspects of these tools and other conveniences available in our world. You might just start enjoying your life.  Problems and complaints are always self generated.	positive
2123	336381998	travel	1	Lots of great deals advertised - but they don‚Äôt exist. There are some properties advertised that have been demolished. I clicked on them and they say ‚Äúsold out‚Äù and I kept consistently getting that message regarding particular properties, no matter when or how far in advance I‚Äôd try to book. I tried to contact them, the numbers are out if service. When I finally booked with a different property (using a different service than Priceline - that frustrates me with their ‚Äúsold out‚Äù and ‚Äútoo late‚Äù garbage) the other property told me those advertised on Priceline were no longer in business (for over a year and a half), and one was torn down and doesn‚Äôt exist! Another fakery: ‚Äúlet us choose and you‚Äôll get a great deal.‚Äù LOL I entered various dates for up to two years. Nothing. If you don‚Äôt have it or can‚Äôt do it, DON‚ÄôT ADVERTISE IT. The app does nothing, and is worthless. The one booking I made with Priceline  I canceled. Why? Because they required payment up front (not problem) but I found a better deal that DID NOT require payment until the day before the stay. Priceline is a zero.	positive
2124	336381998	travel	1	So I used toLove Priceline I use them to stay for two weeks in Atlanta had great service and great hotels everything was fantastic until I saw there was a charge on my card for a hotel in a whole different state so of course I called the hotel said there was nothing they could do had to call Priceline call Priceline customer care stayed on the phone with them for about 10 minutes arguing about the fact that I was having to pay for a hotel I didn‚Äôt even book and the woman kept saying she understood all she could do was send me an itinerary but couldn‚Äôt refund me my money or cancel the reservation when I kept telling her I did not book a reservation in a whole different state all she kept saying was I understand understand but obviously she didn‚Äôt because I‚Äôm somehow expecting to pay for a whole weekend in a whole different state that I didn‚Äôt even book so I just have to pay for a hotel I‚Äôm not saying and please tell me how that makes sense? So upset that this happened because I really liked Priceline but now obviously I can‚Äôt trust this company.	positive
2125	336381998	travel	1	I booked a hotel for seven days and I expected a hotel that was four stars with very good reviews but it when I arrived I was very disappointed. When I first entered the front desk was not welcoming at all. Then when I entered my room, it was not a room that is four-star worthy. It was very old-fashioned and seemed like a hospital. The bathroom didn‚Äôt even have a hood. The air conditioner was also very old. I assumed that all the hotels were like this around the beach since it was supposed to be a four star hotel, but my friend booked another hotel that was 3.5 stars and the hotel was completely different and of better quality than the one I stayed at and it was at a better price. I would also say that $80 would be too much for a night. Their room also had a beautiful view while mine didn‚Äôt have one. Their room was so much better and I‚Äôm absolutely disappointed as I trusted this app very much. I‚Äôm never going to use this app/website to book another trip from this app again and I was tricked into buying a hotel that was not accurately rated.	positive
2126	336381998	travel	1	Booked a hotel quickly due to a deal I wanted. Realizes they allow pet (which I am very allergic even after a someone pet is long gone.) so I immediately tried to cancel that reservation and booked another flash deal for a pet free hotel. I couldn‚Äôt cancel via the app. I tried calling, they told me they would cancel and refund if they hotel was ok, I called the hotel, THEY SAID OK. I called Priceline back, they call the hotel and return to the call with me saying no they can‚Äôt cancel. Hotel says Priceline controls all reservations. Even though they could see the reservations were created back to back, they said no. The other scam is once you look at all the options you like and select a hotel, YOU CAN NOT MAKE A FINAL REVIEW OF ITEM:PURCHASE before you confirm like you do in online shopping. YOU CANNOT! GET A REFUND FOR TAP OF WRONG BUTTON 1 SECOND AFTER YOU PURCHASE NOR CHANGE TO A DIFFERENT DAY, NOR GET A CREDIT. Their customer service & supervisor have been trained to say no regardless of facts or issue. If you confirm a reservation, your money is gone no matter what.	negative
2127	336381998	travel	1	Second time i use this app & the last one. People!, this website offer you deals that once you sign up for them/ paid for them, the extra fees become a ripoff. A good example of this are the their alliance with FOX RENTAL CAR.  This car rental company is a complete RIPOFF!!!!! Please do yourself a favor, and DO NOT rent a car with this company. You might think that you might be able to get a ‚Äò‚Äôdeal‚Äô‚Äô through Priceline; however once you are in the counter, you won‚Äôt only have to wait in line for over 1 hour; they will also force you to add one insurance and hidden fees will come off , that you won't see until after you return the car.  At the end of the day, you would end up paying 3-4 times more of what you were initially paying. Customer service is ok, people in the San Francisco airport location are rude to the point that they make you feel that they are doing you a favor.   FOX RENTAL CAR= will ruin you vacation. Priceline and FOX rental car= conspiracy against them customer with fake deals	negative
2128	336381998	travel	1	Booked a hotel for Wednesday and another room for Thursday. My flight was cancelled Wednesday morning. I cancelled my rooms right away ON WEDNESDAY. They didn‚Äôt call to cancel until THURSDAY even though I called the hotel personally and got them to give the okay to cancel the room on Wednesday, but Priceline needed to make the call themselves...not me. I used that God awful chat system to give them the name of the account rep at the hotel on Wednesday, but again...they waited a day to call on my behalf...the hotel didn‚Äôt cancel my reservation...why would they? Priceline admitted it was messed up and they should have called that day, even though i did their job for them, but all they could do was just apologize while I ate the $100 for the room...oh...they did offer a 5% discount on my next booking. The customer service reps also didn‚Äôt really speak English well and I kept repeating myself. After over 5 hours on line and the phone all I have is a bunch of ‚Äúsorry‚Äù statements, frustration, and $100 less in my pocket. They could care less about customer service.	negative
2129	336381998	travel	4	I book the same hotel off the app every week. Every week I type in the location I want. Every time it shows hotels downtown Dallas when they are 3 times the price and require a $20 Uber ride.  I ask for specifics in the filter ‚Äòdistance from location‚Äô and the first time I booked, a hotel downtown popped up I thought great and booked it. Only to find out it was not close and did not provide an airport shuttle as promised. I know first world problems, but I now know I have to scroll thru to find the hotel I want. I wish when I put in the neighborhood ‚Äòarea‚Äô it would put that area first. And the filter does not really work because you say distance closest to and it puts you 10-15 miles away I guess those hotels must pay a premium to pop up on the top.  Just a warning if you are not familiar with the area check the map, the filter does not work.	positive

2131	336381998	travel	5	My wife and I travel quite a bit, particularly to Florida where our daughter attended college and just recently just graduated. She now lives there. We also travel overseas. Wherever we go, I would not even consider not booking though Priceline. After using other apps and even using points accumulated though the hotels themselves you will never save as much money as you do with Priceline. We are very particular where we stay and if you read the reviews of the hotels and weed though as many reviews of each hotel you can, (there‚Äôs always someone who has a gripe with something) pick one. I almost always pick their special deals as long as there is 4 stars and the reviews are mostly positive. Have been super happy with this approach! Give it a try, you won‚Äôt be sorry!	positive
2132	336381998	travel	2	I was using the app to find a hotel for a college visit for my daughter. I searched and found one on the date we needed for $90. I clicked book it and when the confirmation came through it had the current date, not the future date! Immediately called customer service. They told me that it was a no cancellation/no refund deal! (I know and I was ok with that when the app showed the right dates) she said There was nothing she could do! She said maybe call the hotel and see. So she ‚Äúcalled the hotel‚Äù and said they would allow me to cancel and rebook for the correct date but the cost was $145! What?? Your app said $90 on the correct date now I either lose the 90 I have  already paid or have to pay $145. Yes that was my only option. So because the app screwed up the date...I ended up have to pay an additional $55 for a room! I seriously will not use this app again! I could have gotten better rates through the hotel direct!!	negative
2133	336381998	travel	1	I and my family have used Priceline and other booking sites in the past with no issue. This week I attempted to book an Express Deal through Priceline, upon the first attempted I was given an error message saying the site was having issues and to try again later. Over 12 hours later I go back to try and book again the same deal is still being listed and after a couple more attempts and multiple error messages, none of which said the deal was unavailable, I contacted customer service. They essentially told me that they couldn‚Äôt do anything about the issue and deals listed on their site will typically remain even when they are no longer available. Why would I continue to use a service that does not have correct or updated information, on top of that I was very disappointed in the service I received on this issue not once did the representative apologized for the inconvenience or wasting my time instead simply said this is just how their site is. VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS EXPERIENCE.	negative
2134	336381998	travel	1	"I have had the Priceline credit card for 4+ years now and have booked hotels weekly for work trips and I am very disappointed in this company. I have booked so many times through the app/website and often times never received my rewards points because the payment wasn‚Äôt needed until the arrival at the hotel. When you don‚Äôt pay through the Priceline you don‚Äôt get the points. I then pay with my card at the hotel and still never get my points. I have made cases and have many case #‚Äôs but never get the points I deserve. I have trip #‚Äôs and proof that I booked through the app that should allow me to get the points. Well the lack of customer service never understands this issue and I am left with 0 rewards for using Priceline. I think the easiest solution is to make this an issue and have your IT dept. figure out this reoccurring issue or for me to never use Priceline again.

Not anymore. 

About three weeks ago I accidentally booked my hotel for the wrong weekend and called as soon as I clicked submit, realized it too late!

So I called customer care. The lady was sweet. She said that she email the third party company to see if I could change the date or have my money be refunded. Mind you, I didn‚Äôt want to cancel or my money back, just to change the dates. I was willing to pay the difference. I called on a Saturday at 11ish pm. She said I would hear something back in 2-3 business days. 

I called back on Monday just check that my request wasn‚Äôt being forgotten. The gentleman told me that I should hear something by Wednesday or Thursday. 

Friday came (day before the accidental reservation) and nothing. I called and they said that the company had not replied to them. I called Saturday and the gentleman that answered took my number and went into action and said he was going to call that other company and get them on the ball right away. 

He calls back and tells me that I will get an email in two business days. 

It has been over a week. Nothing. I have email customer service. And nothing. 

After using them for my hotel stays for so many years, I am deleting the app and taking my business elsewhere.

If you don‚Äôt have any friends or family with connections to big hotels and you don‚Äôt like to pay double for a room and you don‚Äôt like to book days or weeks in advance in case your plans change and you‚Äôd like something better than a Motel 6 or Super 8 then go thru Priceline. I‚Äôve booked the actual hotel I want or used Express Deals and have always been happy with the results... well ok there was that time in Kanab Utah where we got an awful room but what can I say, it was Kanab. We‚Äôve never had problems checking in or getting help in getting 1st floor rooms or rooms near elevators for my handicapped hubby.	positive
2137	336381998	travel	4	"Priceline has for the most part treated me pretty good. They have had issues for when you need to call customer service to deal with a problem that you‚Äôre having or By accidentally double booked for triple booking to get a refund can be pretty hard. They can give you a real hard time about it. They usually make you call the hotel that you double booked and ask them if they could cancel the reservation for you because Priceline won‚Äôt. 
What I wish Priceline would or could add would be for us to be able to use our rewards numbers for the different hotels and car rental and air fare programs offered. If they were to do that I would not have any reason to use anyone else at that point and Priceline would be the only app I would have.

2138	336381998	travel	1	Booked a night at the GSR in Reno, NV. For my anniversary. When I got to Reno I couldn‚Äôt stay because of a death in the family. 2 days before Christmas, on my Anniversary and the hotel was 100% full with more people wanting a room. I figure if the hotel can rent my room then I should get a refund. The hotel manager tells me to call Agoda, who the reservation was made, if they agree to refund my money the hotel wouldn‚Äôt charge them to get a refund.  I call the number the hotel gives me to explain the situation and ask that they agree to refund me my money when the room was re rented. Priceline says the hotel won‚Äôt agree and the hotel manager is saying they had a deal even before I booked a room and they will still charge  Priceline even though the room was rented. Its a deal take your money and they split it with the hotel. Grand Sierra Resort blames Priceline and Priceline blames Grand Sierra Resort. The only reason I give them 1 star is because the app and review system make you select one to make a review.	positive

The express deals 9/10 are better hotels than I would generally buy and are generally at I price I wouldn‚Äôt normally pay for a hotel...because they are just that cheap! Once I got a 4 star suite 10th floor for only $54! 

If you have a problem their support center is very good at making sure you‚Äôre happy. All around this is a must have service for anyone traveling who wants to save all the cash they can! In one year I saved $2,500 on express deals."	positive
2140	336381998	travel	5	My husband and I were going on a trip at the end of this month and made reservations through Priceline for a hotel. We found amazing, affordable prices upon booking. Due to covid-19 and isolation recommendations, we had to cancel our trip and reservations. The cancellation took zero waiting time and I was able to do it through their automated system in a matter of a couple of minutes. I was also given a refund that will post back to my bank in a couple of days. We have experienced wonderful service and reliability with Priceline. As first time customers, we are extremely satisfied and this will now be our go to for all of our future reservations.	positive
2141	336381998	travel	1	This company is ‚Äúbush league‚Äù when it comes to customer service.  I used Priceline for all my travel, 50-75 nights per year.  When I needed them most, they did not come through. This is not the first time.  This is a reoccurring issue. I‚Äôm done.  They take your money for rooms that don‚Äôt exist, then blame the hotels when they can‚Äôt come through.  They don‚Äôt understand how to handle the customer relationship, when there is a problem, they hide.  They blame the hotels.  Obviously, they carry no clout with the major hotels otherwise they would not hide.  I‚Äôll never trust that their bookings are solid.  I am a business owner, and I hope they experience poor results to change their behavior.  I also hope this review will help send customers elsewhere.  There are better companies out there that ‚Äúget it.‚Äù   It‚Äôs unfortunate that marketing can cover for poor results.  Long term, as a consumer, I hope we don‚Äôt reward companies like this. They should not survive.	positive
2142	336381998	travel	5	Just like everyone said - if you have an issue that needs to be resolved don‚Äôt expect their customer service to help.  They are so robotic in their approach and do nothing but apologize because as every interaction I had with them so I do so scripted.  I booked a hotel that clearly showed they offer shuttles to and from the airport however when I called the hotel they told me they did not.  I called Priceline to rectify the issue in atleast giving me credit to cover the cost of the taxi and they only offered me 20% which isn‚Äôt enough plus all the hassle of finding a taxi to take me to my hotel at 2am.  Again if you have an issue expect to take atleast an hour on the phone and get a resolution that you will not be happy with.	positive
2143	336381998	travel	1	I have been a Priceline customer for the last 10+ years. However, the most recent booking has been a disaster. I booked a hotel near a themes park on their app using the map feature. It turned out, when trying to check in at the hotel that I was made to believe that I booked, that the one I booked was actually many miles away. It was dark and I had driven the whole day in an unfamiliar area, and the kids were hungry and tired. The Priceline customer service I called, including the manager, insisted that I signed a contract when I clicked the book button on their app and thus solely responsible for whichever hotel I booked, disregarding the fact that their app provided the false information in the first place. This is the first time I ever contacted their customer service, and it will be the last. I will also advise anyone we know against using Priceline. Keep in mind that when they made a mistake, you, the customer, is at fault.	negative
2144	336381998	travel	1	My husband and I have been planning a road trip with our child to Washington D.C for the holiday. Through many days of saving and plans we were ready to purchase our hotels. Through confusion we made a mistake as humans do and booked my hotels a day off. So two of my hotels overlapped. IMMEDIATELY did we notice the issue and called Priceline‚Äôs customer service. We understood the policy and asked for some empathy as we had booked 4 other hotels as well and have been a loyal customer. While on the phone for over 3 hours my husband I were hung up on 4 times. And everytime we made it back to a man who said he was a senior advisor and consistently hung up. All he said was ‚ÄúIM NOT GOING TO KEEP GOING WITH YOU WE ARE DONE HERE‚Äù AND HUNG UP. Of course I‚Äôm frustrated and angered at TERRIBLE customer service Priceline had although they advocate in the beginning of the call for how great their agents are. I‚Äôve never been talked to so poorly and treated so terribly by a company that has my money. Terrible terrible staff..	negative
2145	336381998	travel	1	I have been a longtime loyal customer with Priceline. I always purchase insurance every time I buy an airline ticket because you never know what will happen but have never used it. I got a ticket for a friend to visit & he ended up in the hospital & was not able to use it so when I went to use the insurance I was told I was never charged for it. I was told by 2 different customer service agents that they could see where I selected it in my purchase process but somehow was never charged.  They then sent my issue to the escalation team. There is no way to speak to the escalation team to explain your issue it is all routed though very friendly customer service but they are not able to do anything but tell you what the escalation team wrote in comments. I was ultimately told there was nothing that could be done & I had to eat the price of the ticket because I didn‚Äôt have the insurance. This will be the last thing I purchase through Priceline!	positive
2146	336381998	travel	1	"I used to book through Priceline for all my travels. However, now the app advertises one price and then increases it when you try to book. They prices shown are not the actual prices. Just ‚Äúcome in‚Äù prices. Obviously this is on purpose because they could program pricing like all the other sites/apps. 

Also, recently I tired to book a site even though the price went from $85 to $104 when I clicked book this rate. The app wouldn‚Äôt let me go further saying that they couldn‚Äôt find the information on this hotel deal. I had to go inside the hotel and got a rate of $93 which was better than Priceline anyway. 

I called Priceline and tried to book, but they won‚Äôt let you. I asked to talk to tech support and they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have any‚Äù.  The lady did apologize 1,000 times. I felt like they were smiling at me and saying too bad that‚Äôs the way it is and laughing. Did not get a good feeling about the company.

I also booked awhile back and they gave my reservation away. I traveled hours only to find I had no place to stay. Lesson learned was that hotels can give 3rd party rooms away.

Bottom line is that the company hides prices in the app, when you try to book it may or may not work. Customer service will apologize and say there‚Äôs nothing they can do. You can‚Äôt book through them on the phone nor report any issues with their app."	positive
2147	336381998	travel	1	"When you book express deal they are not providing you with same level hotel. I booked 2 1/2 hotel like holiday inn or best western but I was put in red roof. Everybody knows this is not the same quality hotel. I had two children with me and I was afraid for my security. When I called to see what possible we can do I received the worst service ever. I was told that there is nothing they can do - I can‚Äôt be refunded; I can‚Äôt receive a hotel that I paid for and I can‚Äôt talk to a manager. The woman was so rude that she was putting me on mute every time I‚Äôm trying to explain her my problem. 
I started to ask her questions on purpose and every time she spoke she would not answer my questions just to prove that she is not even listening. I had never ever had so bad experience. I‚Äôm speechless when comes to their customers service. It was so bad that it‚Äôs beyond every explanation. 
Priceline became really a bad option. I will never use them again"	negative
2148	336381998	travel	4	"The app works great and I have used it a lot. Always useful to find hotels near me wherever I am. I can get past minute lodging unless it is very late at night. It would be nice to improve the ability to find something after midnight. Sometimes when you are on the road, you need that. 
I need to give myself a huge reminder that the express deals are almost always super crappy. The hotels are almost always a step down from what is advertised. I have had to cancel a booking in more than one occasion because the express deal hotel was run down or felt unsafe. So note to self: pay more, know what you are getting yourself into. 
In sum: the app works great but the express deal features tend not to deliver a quality experience."	positive
2149	336381998	travel	1	Buyer beware...even though you may select how many adults and children and search, the prices that come up and you pay is double occupancy only for most all-inclusives. Searched for an all-inclusive in Mexico for 2 adults and 1 child, 15. Found the place our group is going and booked a standard room with 1 double bed and a king bed. Turns out the room is for double occupancy and my daughter was not included even though the search came up with a selection that even said ‚Äúrecommended for your party‚Äù, my party being 3 people - or so I thought. So, the trip is in <3 weeks and Priceline tells me to contact hotel and hotel tells me to contact Priceline. Contact #3 and Priceline contacts the resort and the quote for my daughter is almost what I am paying for my husband and I for 6 nights. Still working through it but soo disappointed in what I consider to be a misleading and false site. Will be using a travel agent from now on.	negative

2190	1498817833	games	3	At first, it‚Äôs a bit interesting. I will be honest, though. The rope can be a weapon. I was confused at first but then I found it that it‚Äôs considered a tool. The ‚Äútoo much cash‚Äù thing confused me at first as well. My confusion was one of the only things that made this game a bit more fun for me. It got repetitive fast... it‚Äôs simply the same each time. I don‚Äôt understand why people say that this game is racist, as a black female I don‚Äôt find it racist. I love the diversity and the ‚Äúmost wanted‚Äù concept. However, there could still be more variety, like families, and occasionally pregnant women, crippled, elderly people, people in wheelchairs, or using crutches, things like that. It‚Äôs weird when the officer says ‚Äústop him‚Äù occasionally when the person being arrested is a female. Also... I don‚Äôt know. I suppose I find it sad when a person gets arrested for bringing food... it would have been better if the person had the option to throw it away instead of being arrested. Basically, this game is mediocre, you swipe right if the person doesn‚Äôt have what is not permitted, swipe left if they do, and repeat. I would only play this if I was waiting in a ridiculously long line or something similar. Also, there should be an option for the officer to have a customized gender and features. It also would be nice if people could occasionally raise their weapons and try to attack people and the player had to stop them; that would be fun.	negative
2191	1498817833	games	4	I like this game a lot! It‚Äôs like a professional game! Nice animation but the guy with his head stuck down that everyone‚Äôs talking about, mine doesn‚Äôt have a head at all!üò¨ it‚Äôs just a bug so if it‚Äôs happening to everyone‚Äôs then I‚Äôm fine. There is another problem though, whenever I enter into the app since I‚Äôm not allowed to purchase anything it gives me this thing that says I‚Äôm purchasing something and it makes me worried to play because I ask myself: Does this app cost money? Then why can you download it for free if it costs money?! I‚Äôm sorry but it makes me think that the app is tricking you into buying it. Now I‚Äôm not saying it is but it‚Äôs weird! Can you please tell me why? So people that don‚Äôt have the warning please just be careful!üò≥	positive
2192	1498817833	games	3	"I like this game...A LOT but there is a ad after every and I mean EVERY round! At first it was normal or at least I thought until it popped up ads left and right! Second thing is I get the tools and weapons mixed up. I know what your thinking ‚Äúhow is it possible?‚Äù Well you see a saw can be used as a weapon; A hammer too. Also what is the rope handcuff thing!? Is it rope!? Or is it handcuffs and the money ‚Äútoo much money‚Äù? Maybe I‚Äôm thinking too realistic but what if they wanted to spend a lot of money on that plain or vacation? 

  Recommendations~ Cut the ads down to maybe every 3-5 rounds. Could you add to where we have to check briefly cafes and that kind of luggage? 

*Please remember this is my opinion ,and what I think people may like ,and what I would like to see changed*"	positive
2193	1498817833	games	4	I really like this game but it needs some changes. I get so confused on which side is rejected and approved. so I think that there should be two buttons so then you don‚Äôt have to lose points on swiping the wrong way. And I get a little confused on why the police dance. And for some reason they make some things that are bad like weapons go in like it is something that is not bad. If you would ask me for my opinion on the age rating I would say this game is maybe ok for 7year olds maybe not But it is a pretty amazing game so i think with the changes it would make it a even better game thanks for taking out time to read my review.	positive
2194	1498817833	games	3	Good game over all, and I‚Äôm not one for leaving bad reviews or long ones, so sorry if this is one. It‚Äôs a well game, but there are too many adds.

Again I don‚Äôt mean to be rude, but,  I think that the eyes should just be changed and have a different color of the eyes. And why is there so many ads? After one round, it‚Äôs another add. And after another round, it‚Äôs the same add. How many times do u have to show one add. Oh that‚Äôs, right, according to this game, after one round again and again and again.

But anyways, I have two more things to say:
One, turn on airplane mode if the ads are annoying. It‚Äôs so simple!
Two, the people saying this game is ‚Äúsick‚Äù, and ‚Äúa Trump supporting game‚Äù, are just uneducated. America protects their border just like pretty much every other country.

2199	1498817833	games	1	at first I thought the game was great! That is until I realized that after every level you have to watch an ad. The ads are so so soooo annoying that it pretty much makes the game unplayable. If you have time and patience then maybe this is the game for you but if you hate waiting and all that nonsense then steer clear of this so called game. I just deleted it. That‚Äôs why I only gave it 1 star. To be honest though if I could rate 0 stars that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd rate this nonsense. Ignore the 1 Star I put up because this game gets 0 stars from me. Not..worth...it!!! Find a different game to play trust me	positive
2200	1459289784	lifestyle	1	My main reason for giving them 1 star is because I bought the video doorbell and when my free trial ended it just told me motion on the doorbell vs vehicle, person, or animal which I was fine with.  Tonight I saw a neighbors cat get attacked by a dog from across the street.  I thought maybe I can check my doorbell to see if I could get more information about the dog and maybe verify which cat was attacked if the cat caused the doorbell to activate, because when I pulled in they were off camera at that time.  After I chased the dog away I lost track of the cat, so I could not tell him which cat because it happened so fast, assuming the cat would have activated my camera.  I could not do that because I do not pay, so it did not save the video, if there was video, to the cloud for 7 days because of that.  The regular arlo cameras get saved for a week, but not the doorbell.  So I paid about $150 for a doorbell to tell me there is motion, but not record anything unless I pay a monthly fee!!  I do not know if the other companies using video doorbells charge or not, but I would think at least record but do not tell me if it is an animal, person, or vehicle unless I look at the video.  I would not have a problem with them charging and granting 30 days for the doorbell camera and telling me who or what is causing the camera to operate, but unless I am watching I will not know who or what caused the camera to activate.	positive
2201	1459289784	lifestyle	2	I love my Arlo set up except after a short time one of them stopped alerting or even storing any movements. If I watched it ‚ÄúLive‚Äù  that‚Äôs the only thing that it would work. I found it difficult to get any tech support and I work my way around technology and such typically very well.  I took the batteries out and removed the device and then added it as a device again is the only way to make it work. What a pain! I had to get up on a ladder. And there are alert zones you can set but you can only set them while they are plugged in. How do you do that with any accuracy, they are wireless. Also, they need more selections for pausing alerts.  How about letting the customer choose an exact amount of hours? If I want 8 hours 2 hours or whatever? Then I bought a pack of two cameras label said Arlo Pro 2 but they were Netgear without rechargeable batteries nor a place to plug in a solar panel or zones to set nor two way voice.  False advertising. I had to buy batteries and they are expensive. Two sets of batteries would have paid for the solar panel accessory. I guess I won‚Äôt be buying a solar panel which works great! I did buy one for one of my true Arlo cameras. Save your money for the pack that comes with as many cameras as you will need instead of adding more later because the additional ‚ÄúNetgear‚Äù cameras won‚Äôt have all the features. Besides that, ‚Äú I love my Arlo and app.	positive
2202	1459289784	lifestyle	1	"Update 1: Ever since the transition from the Legacy app to this new buggy app the performance has been terrible and getting worst with each new updates. The latest update has made me extremely nervous as the camera sometimes stops detecting motion.  I know it‚Äôs not a connectivity issue or the positioning of the camera.  Also, any recording takes a long time to upload and many times I need to exit the app then go back in for it to upload.  What is going on with Arlo?  It‚Äôs becoming unreliable and untrustworthy.

Update 2:   So frustrating.  The new update released few days ago did not fix the motion detection issue.  There are now more missed detections than before.  All of my cameras don‚Äôt detect movements even though I purposely testing them.  Getting extremely upset at the amount of money I spent on Arlo products.  Will be looking elsewhere and will not recommend this to people.  Disappointed that this once great product got butchered with months.

Update3:  all of sudden I no longer receive any notifications.  I have to check the library for recordings so that makes my cameras basically useless.  The high stars ratings in the App Store is very deceptive as they were rated before Arlo became an independent company.  Since then I‚Äôve only seen mostly negative ratings in the Store.  People should sort ratings by Most Recent to get get a sense of Arlo product before purchasing!"	negative
2203	1459289784	lifestyle	5	"The app and cameras work wonderfully. Both are very easy to navigate and use. The only issue I have had with either the app or camera. When off site and I try to connect to the cameras live feed and microphone to talk to the person in the camera, my success on the live feed is fairly solid (success 95%) but when I select the microphone it either takes to long to activate or I get an connection error (success 30%). 
Otherwise very happy with the set up. Purchased at Costco 2-3 years ago. 
Oh battery life is surprisingly very good. During the winter battery south facing outside last about 3-4 months with about 20 daily alerts. During the summer about 1-3 months, with the same amount of alerts. I mention south facing because the heat does drain from the battery life. Cameras indoors last about 8 months but also on only about 5 times a month. Again the cooler the room the longer the battery life. 
Also I will pull a camera down from indoors and charge the battery fully and then use it to change out the south facing battery. This allows for little disturbance on my main camera."	positive
2204	1459289784	lifestyle	1	I bought two (2) Arlo Pro 2 three (3) Wire-Free HD Security Cameras a few days ago from Costco. I set up the app and starting install the cameras. When I went to install the final 6th camera, the app gave me a message that it will only support five (5) cameras and if I wanted to support the 6th, I would have to join a plan for $9.99 PER MONTH. No where are you given this information in advance until you try to set up the 6th camera. The box says ‚ÄúFree app‚Äù. It obviously is not free and I think it is deceptive. When you go to ‚ÄúSupport‚Äù my device (VCS3000C) is not even listed. When you go to ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù, it states ‚ÄúProblem solved‚Äù- you must get the latest app version, the old one sent the 6th camera message in error. Not so. I installed the latest app and still can not set up the 6th camera. When you call for support, they tell you you need to buy a 6 camera system or pay for a plan. (By the way, the Costco Concierge Services phone support told me the same thing- you need to purchase a monthly plan to make all 6 cameras work). I will probably take down the five cameras I installed and return them to Costco (along with a complaint) for a full refund. Next time I will be more careful choosing a system. The Costco tech guy whom praised the Arlo system did not mention the 6 camera issue either. Maybe he did not know.	positive
2205	1459289784	lifestyle	2	The cameras work fantastic, and the batteries last forever. They are great home security cameras. However there is one huge issue I have with my Arlo pro 2 system. You can not change the sound notification or volume to the Arlo notifications. These aren‚Äôt cheap systems, you should be able to set siren style tones to wake you up if your camera is activated. It should also be able to be on loud, even if your other notifications are are silenced. I would even go one step further and add functions to control sounds and volumes on the cameras individually. Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs very hard to do with apps these days (I could be wrong). If you sleep and don‚Äôt wake up to a regular text message notification then you won‚Äôt wake up to your Arlo cause it‚Äôs the same thing. Some thieves tried to get into our cars in the driveway, would of loved to have been able to call the cops on them while they were here. Instead I woke up 3 hours later and just got to watch a creepy video of strangers walking around in my driveway (luckily the cars were locked and they just left). What‚Äôs the point then of having these cameras (especially considering the price tag)? If your even a remotely heavy sleeper I would suggest trying a different setup.	positive
2206	1459289784	lifestyle	5	The app works great and is simple to configure. I purchased them to watch over our vacation home when we are away. I have a mix of both Arlo Pro and Pro 2 Cameras. They are easy to setup, install and maintain. The battery life is very good; however, it also depends on a number of factors, like resolution & sensitivity settings and if they are placed in high traffic areas. Those factors and settings could result in shorter battery life. I also configured them with the Arlo doorbells and chime. Those features also work very well and is similar to a Ring doorbell system when you couple it with a camera viewing the doorways.  Overall, I‚Äôm very satisfied and it alerts me through the app whenever someone enters my property. I can then view in real-time or playback the video of who and what‚Äôs going on. Last, if you need to also record sound and communicate through the system the Arlo Pro 2 cameras support those features. Overall, I highly recommend the Arlo system and you do not need a professional to set it up.	positive
2207	1459289784	lifestyle	2	"If I bought a 4 pack of cameras. I have two for inside coverage and two for outside. I cannot create a custom mode to include only the two outside cameras, you can setup a mode with only one or all.  I work from home and do not need the inside ones on all the time. But would like the outside ones on. Seems pretty logical. 
The doorbell sensitivity seems off too. Seems like you have to push the button rather firmly to work. I frequently have deliveries and they end up knocking on my door. I asked them why they didn‚Äôt use the doorbell and they said they did, but didn't hear anything. The chime is right by the entrance and is set loud enough. I then go try the doorbell myself and it works but have to press hard enough to get it to ring.
The setup was a challenge too. I used to have a Netgear Router a long time ago and apparently had a Netgear account. When I went to register my Arlo cameras it kept telling me my account (email) had already existed. I then tried the forgot / reset password and it told me the email was unrecognizable... I finally had to chat online with support to get it resolved. But was very frustrating. Once that was resolved the setup was great and fun!"	positive
2208	1459289784	lifestyle	1	I‚Äôve had my Arlo pro wire free system for about a year now, I use to love it but now it hardly works. It seems connecting to live stream only works once a day. Once I am able to connect that one time a day, as soon as I turn off the live stream on my phone it will not connect again. It‚Äôs always loading and then fails. I‚Äôve checked my connection and my WiFi and it‚Äôs not the problem, it‚Äôs something within the system. So because I‚Äôm unable to live stream I rely on the notifications when motion is detected, now this works, however it hardly records anymore. I‚Äôve tried trouble shooting from their website and other sources and I have not been able to fix this either. So now I‚Äôm stuck with a system that only notifies me when motion is detected but I‚Äôm hardly ever able to see why, there‚Äôs no access to the live stream and no recorded videos. I‚Äôve done everything I can and haven‚Äôt had any success. It‚Äôs come to the point where I try to restart the system every other day, removing the cameras and re syncing, in hopes it‚Äôll get better but it never does these two problems can‚Äôt get resolved. In the end I‚Äôve come to realize it only performs one of the services I need it for. It‚Äôs become a waste of my time.	negative
2209	1459289784	lifestyle	1	I bought an ARLO Go about a 18 months ago. It worked fine for a time but am now on my 4th replacement. All have had various problems with the most common being going offline for hours and days at a time without ever returning to service until I physically reboot the camera by removing the battery. ARLO Go‚Äôs are supposed to reboot theirselves when signal returns. I have contacted both ARLO and Verizon support numerous times and what I get is lip service and no concrete reason for the problem. I live in a large metropolitan area with many cell towers so despite the fact signal strength may weaken for short periods it always comes back. But not the ARLO. Seems the ARLO and Verizon people want me to solve a problem I have no control over. FYI. I have another ARLO Go at a remote cabin where it barely gets a cell signal and has worked flawlessly for 3 years. It occasionally goes offline for a couple minutes (never hours or days) because of the weak signal at the location but always returns to service on it‚Äôs own and sends an email noting it is back online. You would think the 18 month old ARLO would do the same given it‚Äôs ready access to cell signals. Something just isn‚Äôt right and neither ARLO nor Verizon have been of value in resolving this.	positive
2210	1459289784	lifestyle	2	"When I first purchased my Arlo Pro2 cameras, I was talked into the upgraded cameras because of the many options they had. You used to be able to set activity zones and receive alerts for only specific activity such as persons, animals, or vehicles. Since the update, you can no longer set these options or others unless the cameras are connected to AC power. What‚Äôs the point in wireless cameras if they need to be plugged in? Now I get alerts for every squirrel that runs down the sidewalk despite buying the upgraded cameras so I wouldn‚Äôt have to.

The Geofencing has never worked since day one. You‚Äôre also supposed to be able to add additional users but they will not be recognized by the Geofencing. My interior camera has also stopped working which they refuse to address. The camera will not reset and can not be connected to my base unit. 

The only reason this product even received 2 stars is because the video image is impressive. The picture quality is great in daylight or in darkness and the ability to listen through the cameras is a nice option. Expect a slow connection and lagging picture though unless you‚Äôre on the network the cameras are on."	positive
2211	1459289784	lifestyle	3	"The concept is very good, picture quality is very good, motion sensing is very poor. Installed the cameras according to the required Hight and yet detection is 8‚Äô at best. 
Getting many false motion, trees, wind and even bugs trigger motion. Ever since I installed the system (approx 6 months) Had many issues with the system. 2 of 6 cameras that had power adapter hooked, started background noise, Arlo sent 2 new ones, that fixed the issue, within 6 months of installation, Arlo has replaced 3 cameras mostly for false motion sensing. The app concept is very good, but has very lag in viewing live or recorded videos. 
Cons: lag time for live or recorded videos
While you are on live view and motion detected on the same camera, it will not be recorded. Unless you press the record icon and at the time you start viewing live, the motion has already ended. 
If someone enters my driveway and continues to my backyard, 3 cameras will detect the motion, I get notifications on my phone, but won‚Äôt be able even to view the very 1st camera recording. At the time video is available to view the intruder has already gone!"	negative
2212	1459289784	lifestyle	1	When I bought my Arlos about two years ago I was jazzed to have them. After researching a lot I settled on the Arlos because of the video quality, the app and the versatility the cameras gave you. Today the luster has warn off for sure. The cameras are still good and I do have mine plugged in so I do have the option for zone movement and don‚Äôt have to charge the batteries. That‚Äôs the good part. The bad part is the app hasn‚Äôt gotten any major updates, it lags immensely, and recently it has just stopped recording whole sections of movement. It really is a brick that I want to toss into the ocean. I would love Arlo to get with it and fix their lag issues and update the software. Lastly I would like Arlo to take security seriously. In all of the years I have been using the internet and SaaS products I haven‚Äôt ever had one hacked, so to find out my security camera company was hacked and I had to change all passwords that shared Arlos website password just made me think that this is a company on a decline and I need to seriously think about moving on. As soon as I sit down and research another company they could certainly get my business. Please redeem yourselves before I get to that point!	positive
2213	1459289784	lifestyle	1	"Since Arlo updated their app to Arlo Legacy, we‚Äôve been having constant issues with connectivity and lagging (HUGE problem for a ‚Äúsecurity system‚Äù). It takes much longer to log in and pull up a camera feed. Then, once I‚Äôm viewing a live feed it either disconnects or starts to lag terribly within the first 5 seconds, rendering the camera useless as the activity is not captured or recorded, and on top of that I can‚Äôt even see what‚Äôs happening. If you‚Äôre logged in viewing a live stream, the app doesn‚Äôt record and save that clip, even if it‚Äôs lagging or disconnecting. The record feature doesn‚Äôt work as well either, since....the app is lagging too much to even activate it.

Our internet provider and WiFi setup haven‚Äôt changed. We‚Äôre experiencing dropped connections and lagging while using data (regardless of where we are or how we‚Äôre connecting). This issue only started with the new app upgrade.

I‚Äôm incredibly disappointed that Arlo can‚Äôt seem to maintain the software side of their product. The hardware is great! But, now I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this system to anyone since it‚Äôs nearly impossible most days to actually view your camera streams in a timely and reliably manner."	negative
2214	1459289784	lifestyle	4	"Last night at 1:30am a strange man came up to our front stoop, looked in the window then rang the doorbell, then he sat down and started eating.  I was home alone and my husband was out of town.  Instead of looking out a window to see who woke me up in the middle of the night I opened the app- and yes it took about 15 seconds to connect- and I saw this man on our front stoop.  My husband got an alert and texted me while I called 911.  I was able to monitor the man while the police arrived.  I never turned on a light or let the man know anyone was home.  The police arrested the man shortly after they arrived and spoke with him.  An officer called me to let me know that the man had an outstanding warrant.  We live in a very safe neighborhood with good neighbors.

When we got the cameras for Christmas I was just entertaining my husband‚Äôs need for another gadget.  I was wrong.  I‚Äôm not trying to scare anyone, but these things work.  Yeah sometimes they don‚Äôt connect and I have to close and reopen the app- but these things work."	positive
2215	1459289784	lifestyle	1	"EDIT UPDATED: I am very pleased with the Arlo surveillance system. So much so, I added 3 additional cameras. The price is affordable and the app makes it very easy to use. My only complaint is that the motion detection is not as spot on as I would like at times, as the delays sometime miss a vehicle driving into my driveway, literally right in front of it (I know that‚Äôs not necessarily an ‚Äúapp‚Äù issue) but still. Overall the app made it very simple to add-on additional cameras, and the library playback is great. Again, for the $$$ this is the way to go for affordable home surveillance.

UPDATE:
UNREAL!!! Ironically, as fate would have it...The DAY after I leave a glowing review, this app has turned to crap. I am getting alerts of motion detection, but a video clip NEVER COMES THROUGH. Then, while reviewing the clips that do manage to come through, it will start to show a different clip than the one I chose, and as I scroll through the clips the first 5 seconds are of the clip prior to the one I‚Äôm trying to watch, directly before it starts to show the one I should be watching. I literally almost believe I‚Äôve jinxed myself by leaving a good review. I‚Äôm changing my review to a ONE 1 until y‚Äôall get this ish fixed!!!"	positive
2216	1459289784	lifestyle	2	It‚Äôs bizarre to me that nothing about how these cameras or the apps ( all the versions/updates) has been as it was described. On this last app version it was a little better as far as intermittent performances. I paid for a year up front & they kept saying I wasn‚Äôt covered when my cameras started not working well on a regular basis. I had to prove I paid 3 times.  Very hit & miss. Now for $ 9.99 a month. I wanted to pay a year at a time but instead I just keep getting the little reminders that they are going to process another payment. I bought mine through QVC with aa rep from the Arlo lead the demo on the show & I bought them because the quality seemed amazing for small do it yourself cameras. The worked well for about a year. They go through batteries like water & turn 2 turned pink after a year. When I went back & bought 2 cameras through QVC again  Arlo said I would need to register my  home do it yourself cameras. They didn‚Äôt use that tone when I first started through them & the rep demonstrating on the Q. My cameras only work part of the time. I can‚Äôt count on the app or the equipment.	positive
2217	1459289784	lifestyle	1	I use to love the Arlo app; however, I don‚Äôt know why but I lose connection constantly and can‚Äôt get it back without waiting a long time or removing and replacing the battery from the camera. Both options are inconvenient and disappointing after spending so much money on a camera system and it not working now. I‚Äôve looked it up to find a solution other than what I find to work and found out it‚Äôs a common problem now. On top of that, I lost access to my email I registered the arlo app with (thanks google) and was informed by their customer service there‚Äôs no recovering your account and I would have to start a new one; therefore, losing all my videos. So, one would think it can‚Äôt get worse but it can. In order to cancel your recurring monthly payment when you lose access to your email you must go to your financial institution and pay to get a new debit card so the payments cannot go through. Please fix these horrible issues because I want to love my arlo system again and be able to rely on the app working. In the meantime I did buy another more reliable system with an app I can count on.	negative
2218	1459289784	lifestyle	5	I have been very happy with my Arlo Pro 2 with 6 wire free cameras. My son uses the 4 camera configuration and highly recommended the Arlo Pro 2. When my wife and I are away from home, the camera motion detectors send me notifications and records video when someone comes within range of one of the cameras. So far that has been our daughter and a close friend just stopping by to check on our home. I chose to keep all the cameras indoors so I don‚Äôt get nuisance alarms when our neighbors walk their dog. By themselves, the cameras are not a complete home security system. For example, I don‚Äôt have window alarms. However, I am highly confident that we would get a cloud-based video of a bad guy in one ever breaks in. A few times, a camera has not turned back on remotely. I have waited 10 minutes, tried again, and the remote on command has always worked. I‚Äôm happy to have the peace of mind that our home is OK.	positive
2219	1459289784	lifestyle	5	To set the stage, I am a 71 year old widow living alone.  My son insisted that I install the cameras for my, and his, peace of mind.  I had them installed with solar panels, so there is no effort required keeping them charged.  I feel so much more secure now.  The camera on my front porch allows me to see who is approaching and knocking on my front door.  A second camera monitors a hidden alcove, while two more record all activities at my garage and back door.  The cameras have only been installed for about six months, but they have already captured video of an attempted break in at my next door neighbor‚Äôs house.  A young man actively being chased by the police rode his bicycle up my driveway, ditched his bike on my back steps, and jumped the fence.  After failing to get into my neighbor‚Äôs back door, he fled.  The police were able to capture the recording from my ARLO cameras and identify him.  Now two more of my neighbors plan on installing ARLO cameras.  Thank you very much.	positive
2220	1459289784	lifestyle	1	We all had to update the app I think so it could work with the new 4K cameras. They should have made a new app just for 4K and left the old app for the rest of us. The new one is very slow, the notifications of movement come quickly but if you try to view the video of the movement it could take minutes to load and sometimes it never does. Try to view the live feed and again it takes forever to connect to the camera and the view you get is over 2 minutes old. In ether case if if something happens whoever did it will be long gone before you see it if you see it at all.  Called tech line and they said it‚Äôs my network at fault. I have two different camera systems running on two different networks both have the same problem that started at the same time with the app change but it‚Äôs my fault it‚Äôs slow according to them. I liked these a lot before but I can‚Äôt recommend them now. So sad I have a lot invested in a company that doesn‚Äôt seem to care about fixing their problems just pointing blame at it‚Äôs customers for something they obviously did. Read other reviews I‚Äôm not alone.	negative
2221	1459289784	lifestyle	1	We had a moped stolen from our driveway one day ago. The camera is facing directly at the moped. Nothing was recorded. It is simply there when my wife pulled in to the driveway for the night and gone the next morning when we got up for work. No recording. The delays have gotten worse and worse since I first gotten the camera. With that being said there should at least be a ‚Äúdelayed recording‚Äù at some point in the night. Maybe capturing the thief leaving, but even that never recorded. Is it is possible for someone to jam the camera WiFi signal? That is the only other thing I can imagine happened. I currently just finished 10 minutes on hold with customer service and multiple attempts trying to use a callback feature that did not work. Upon connecting with customer service, the agent remained confused likely because of a major language barrier and we talked in circles for several minutes and the confusion only got worse. I asked to please speak with a manager and was put on hold again. When reconnected I was told none were available and to wait 2 hours for a call back. This is ridiculous.	negative
2222	1459289784	lifestyle	1	"Unless you have A LOT of patience, and are willing to try and try and TRY again to properly setup the Arlo system of connected lights (I bought 3) and cameras (I bought 6), don‚Äôt bother with this product. 
For each light and each camera you want to add to the system, you must go thru a tedious, somewhat confusing, and unnecessarily time consuming process by the camera or light is ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù by the corresponding Arlo ‚Äúbase stations‚Äù (of which there are 2, one for the cameras and one for the lights, and for which you must also go thru a setup process to activate and connect with your Wifi network).  It‚Äôs a pain, and worse yet, quite often doesn‚Äôt work.  All you can do is keep trying. And trying.....It‚Äôs simply maddening. 
And, finally, when you do get a camera and/or light discovered/connected to the corresponding base station, the app interface and navigation is simply not intuitive and labeled in geek speak that makes it hard to find things you want to do with the system. 
Great idea, but the quality of the hardware, software and attention to the user experience doesn‚Äôt justify the expense, at least not in my case."	negative
2223	1459289784	lifestyle	1	"This app officially became the worst app for security cameras. Since yesterday every time I want to check the motion alert an ad pops.
Let me describe a typical experience when using this app. When clicked on motion alert most apps would take you directly to live feed. But not arlo. On click it shows you an ad to subscribe to their plan. Once dismissed 3 out of 10 times it would want you to re-login. Good luck if you don‚Äôt have your password saved. Once logged on it takes you inside the app. And now you once again click to see the live feed for the camera that triggered the motion alert. Most cameras would start the feed within 1 or 2 seconds as phone and they all connect to the same Wifi. But not arlo. Arlo will show you ‚Äòconnecting‚Äô spinner for ever as it tries to connect to its cloud and downloads the feed which the arlo hub is uploading. The lag on the feed is significant, atleast 2 seconds. I would see a person walking away in reality when on the camera they are showing walking towards the camera. 
Do yourself a favor stay away if you really want security. Arlo is not for you."	positive
2224	1459289784	lifestyle	5	"I have had my Arlo Pro 2 for about 6 weeks now. For what I paid for it it‚Äôs well worth the value! Triggers happen immediately which was important to me! Also being able to create activity zones has helped reduce triggers. The cameras have to have a/c power for the activity zones to work so keep that in mind. 

I have 1 camera at the back of the house that getting power to it is to tuff. So I purchased the solar panel charger and the activity zone worked only when it was charging the camera. Once topped off it went back to default catching any movement anywhere it can see. So I‚Äôve have had to position the field of view to illuminate some of the day time triggers.

The IR lights work great indoors and have a very limited use outdoors unless it‚Äôs in a small area or the lights have something to reflect off of. I‚Äôve added a couple of IR illuminators which extended the camera field of view. It‚Äôs like turning the the sun at night. The human eye can‚Äôt see the IR lights but the cameras can. 

I‚Äôm very happy with this product and have recommended it to all my friends. Matter a fact I just ordered another addon camera which came in today. I plan on using this camera as a mobile camera in my house.

The battery life is very good and allot of that depends on how much traffic passes it and triggers alerts.

I hope this gives you some insight and helps out!"	positive
2225	1459289784	lifestyle	3	Have been installed for 4 months with 3 Arlo pro 2 cameras. The cameras are slow to connect with the app and intermittently don‚Äôt connect at all. This is especially true when trying to view live action with active movement. (Trying to watch activity around the pool) Interactive voice is too slow to be ‚Äòinteractive‚Äô. I have moved the hub to different locations trying to improve connection with no avail. (we have 300+ Mbs internet on an 3 hub Eero Pro mesh WiFi) The motion activation can be slow as well. I have the sensitivity set to max. An example will be a UPS delivery where the camera doesn‚Äôt activate until the delivery person is walking away from the porch. The batteries seem to last about a month with moderate to heavy activity. The notifications seem to work well on our iPhones/iPads, however, sometimes we get a notification without an associated recording. With the slow/intermittent connection, I would consider your needs for monitoring before purchasing this system.	positive
2226	1459289784	lifestyle	1	I never write reviews, but I have become so frustrated with this app, I seriously want to take all of my cameras back and get my money back.  The picture quality is great, but the app does not work.  It was slow before they changed the app, now it takes forever for the app to load, even longer if you want to pull up one particular camera, the microphone option to be able to speak to someone on the other end does not work at all (keeps saying ‚Äúconnecting‚Äù), and when you want to view recording clips, it takes forever to get one of them to load and then it freezes multiple times.  It‚Äôs not my WiFi, because I have the same problem when not connected to WiFi, or when connected to someone else‚Äôs WiFi.  None of my other devices have any trouble on my WiFi.  When I receive a notification on my phone that there is motion on one of my cameras, it takes me at the very least 3-4 minutes to get it to pull up.  It‚Äôs pointless to have spent so much money on this camera system when I can‚Äôt even access the information.  Extremely frustrated customer!!!	negative
2227	1459289784	lifestyle	1	"This app is just terrible. The lag on the live video is about 10-25 seconds. By the time we get the app open, and try to speak to the person on camera, they are long gone. When you try to position the cameras, sometimes the positioning view will just never come up. My wife and I are the two people on the account and we both can‚Äôt view the cameras at the same time. It will boot one of us out when the other opens the app to view the cameras. Not sure if these things are the app‚Äôs problem or the camera hardware issue, but either way it‚Äôs pretty difficult to use. 
Update: now they have ads that pop up when you try and view your cameras. Example: someone is at my front door, I want to see who it is, before waiting about 15-30 seconds for the camera to connect, I see an ad about starting a monthly subscription ( or a pop up to rate the app, again, for the third time). Then once you exit through that, you have to wait for the connection wait time. By then the person has stolen the package and it probably was recorded by the system."	negative
2228	1459289784	lifestyle	4	Just started using my Arlo pro 2, four camera security system. Gets a solid four stars so far. Getting going was simple and intuitive. There is a variety of mounting hardware and optional power cables available to suit most needs in addition to the ones that come in the kit. Camera and base station set up was easy. First plug the base station into power and the modem, put the battery in the camera, then just download the Arlo app and tap. Within moments I was able to view and access all four of my cameras. So far I have had no problems with the app. It displays videos and information in a well organized manner. A good variety of settings and features allow for flexibility and customization. The surveillance cameras picture is very clear. The tap to zoom in and zoom out feature on your device maybe used to zoom in but this causes some degradation of clarity the more you zoom in. Being a new user I am happy so far.	positive
2229	1459289784	lifestyle	3	I was very happy with Arlo after purchasing our first two cameras. We had a few larcenies in our neighborhood, and I wanted a set of eyes on our home when we were away. After installing the cameras we bought two more, then four more to cover each angle outside and key areas inside the house. Everything worked fine for about a year, then, as soon as the cameras started falling out of warranty, we stated having failures. Night vision features stopped working, individual cameras were falling off line, and battery life declined dramatically on cameras while turned off.   Also, response time for some exterior cameras alerting through the app declined. We have high speed internet, keep the firmware and software up to date with each notification, and use premium batteries. In the end, we‚Äôve replaced our front door two-way camera with a video doorbell, and will most likely replace all the Arlo cameras with another brand as they fail.	negative
2230	1459289784	lifestyle	5	"After my first purchase, and receiving of the Arlo security camera system, I was amazed how easy it was to set it up. It was definitely user friendly. I already had the kguard system, which was a nightmare for me to setup. After using it for awhile,and not to happy with its functions, I decided to give Arlo a try. I needed a wireless system for outside the home. So I bought two, with a base station included in the package. After using them for a while, I decided to buy two more add on cameras which work with my base station. I would suggest to anyone buying a security system for the first time, to do yourself a favor, give Arlo a try. I know you will agree with what I've had to say about this product. 
                      Thank you team Arlo,

2231	1459289784	lifestyle	5	I‚Äôm IT person and I highly recommend this product. It‚Äôs very easy to setup. We own about 6 cameras, doorbell, and chime. The key to the setup is ensuring the base station is located in a central location in the home b/c like any wireless device it will disconnect or not be clear the further its from the base station which is the central hub for the cameras. It‚Äôs also the only truly wireless solution in the market and the battery life is great for the cameras. The motion sensors are great and the speed of the notifications once motion is detected is within 5 seconds. My only suggestion would be for allowing each camera to be armed individually... Great solution with people with small children b/c you can move the cameras around the house depending on where your kids are playing and keep an eye on them at all times since the cameras are connected to the mounts via magnets...	positive
2232	1459289784	lifestyle	5	The cameras are quality and not outrageously expensive like some others. The service is free and that is a huge plus. No subscriptions, storage fees, or other bills. One time purchase with only WiFi as a requirement. The app is very easy to use and is cellphone friendly. This product sells itself. The only complaint I have is that it detects motion and takes videos with too much sensitivity and distance even with sensitivity turned all the way down in the settings. I end up with hundreds of false alarm video clips daily from cars driving past and even snow flakes falling. This CAN be worked around if you plug in the cameras to wired power and set up a motion perimeter. This feature is only useable if the cameras are allowed wall power. Unfortunately my cameras are mounted where I can‚Äôt run line power. Well worth the feeling of security.	positive
2233	1459289784	lifestyle	2	"After having this installed for a year now, I changed to a new WiFi and cannot get my system reconnected with the new WiFi. Customer support does not help. They offer suggestions they do not work and when I tell them it didn‚Äôt work they tell me they‚Äôve closed the work order.  So basically, I have paid for 6 cameras that don‚Äôt work. I have tried to deauthorize the base unit and treat it as if it was a new unit and still no help. The first thing the app says is to be sure the base unit is on the same WiFi as my phone. I CANNOT SEE THE BASE UNIT ON MY PHONE TO SEE IF IT‚ÄôS THE SAME NETWORK.  
I have another account in my 2nd home. I‚Äôm having work done there and I get notified that the workers are there. When I go to expand the view (enlarge), the people disappear from the screen and will not continue to play. The night vision coverage is about 2 feet from the camera and is a poor image of what it actually shows. 
My suggestion is to not waste your money with this system. When there‚Äôs a glitch, customer support is useless."	positive
2234	1459289784	lifestyle	1	"Do not buy these products.  Although they have good hardware, their software support is not capable of keeping the platform features working. Anytime a feature breaks, either by a self-inflicted bug they cause or an IOS change they fail to account for it takes them months to fix it, even for key features. As an example Geo-Fencing, which is pretty important for a security application has been out of service 4 out of the past 8 months. It has currently been down for 2 months and is still down!!  They do very little system testing of some key features and seem to rely solely on their customers for testing. I have used the Arlo products for 3 years since they started as a Netgear product.  The camera hardware is very well designed and provides good basic functions. 
However in the last couple of years the software has been full of glitches and bugs. Once they split from Netgear there has been literally no Software development for this product as their track record from above proves. Time to find another product."	positive
2235	1459289784	lifestyle	2	"We‚Äôve been using arlo for 4 years. We have 11 Arlo Pro cameras and the app has had minimal changes. 

Cons:

-Scrubbing video still is not smooth. 

-Schedules are minimal. Let‚Äôs say I want to mow the lawn and not have the cameras activating every single second. The only way to stop this is turning them off in app or Disarming the whole system. Before I was able to make a Mode that only turned off motion for some cameras like ‚Äúbackyard motion off‚Äù. Now you have to have either motion or sound triggers when making modes. 

-only 2 of my 11 cameras will actually turn off Night Vision if I want. The others will still activate IR even if I turn off in app. 

-Activity Zones are rectangles that cannot be manipulated so if you have a fairly angled area you want to activate you have to add tons of boxes. I‚Äôve seen other apps make this so much easier. 

-Package detection is a joke. Should not even be a feature considering it function like a beta 1.0. It eats up battery and triggers to everything except packages. Cats, arms, leaves, etc. 

-‚ÄúRecord Video Until Video Stops‚Äù mode doesn‚Äôt work unless movement first occurs within 15ft of camera. For instance, if I drive up to my house and back in I get 15 seconds of the initial car driving up 25ft away and then recording stops when car is still moving closer to camera. 

Pros:

-Smart detection of People, Vehicles and Animals works great and is very accurate. 

-notifications are fast and snapshots are great."	positive
2236	1459289784	lifestyle	3	"The feature to control the arming/disarming of Arlo using voice commands via Alexa worked for a few weeks, but quit working a couple weeks ago. Unfortunately, Alexa responds to requests to arm/disarm as if the command has been completed, but if you check the status you‚Äôll find the security setting hasn‚Äôt changed.

The Haptic Touch in iOS has the same issue. Beginning a few months ago you could use it to reliably arm/disarm, but it also no longer works.

Also, in general the app is not well designed. Features common in other apps - eg. sweeping left, right, up, down - to take care of common tasks such as deleting videos are unavailable.

Also, in the iPad version the buttons to delete videos are located in three different corners of the screen rather than together, so so are forced to tap all over the place to remove videos.

Also, icons and text on video playback screens can blend into the background depending on light and dark areas of the video capture.

Also, videos take FOREVER to refresh IF AT ALL. Usually I need close and then reopen the app to get the newer videos added.

Also, disabling/enabling cameras should be easy, but it‚Äôs not.

Most of these design issues have been around since day one.

This is not a very good app. Unfortunately the designers at Arlo appear to be too prideful and thoughtless to hand the design off to others who are better at at."	negative
2237	1459289784	lifestyle	5	"I have had my Arlo system for over a year now. It‚Äôs been perfect. I get the notice that my kids are home from school everyday. Log in and say hello through my phone. 

I agree with some people that it can be difficult to set up. But let‚Äôs see if I can help you out. Read below. 

For those that have it set up but it‚Äôs not working. Try to first reset the system ‚Äúcompletely unplug and remove the batteries‚Äù. Turn it back on to see if it works. 

If your still having problems. Next step would be to uninstall your APP on your phone and re-install it. Log into your account and check if it works. 

Still having problem after trying everything above. Start completely fresh. On the back of your Arlo hub is a ‚Äúreset‚Äù. You will need a small paper clip to reset it. Also reset your cameras by holding the power button until it starts flashing. Once you do that try again. 

If it still does not work you may have a faulty system. These Arlo systems are very close to perfect. But sometimes things happen. Contact the company so they can walk you through the process. 

Also one more thing to discuss. If you have multiple cameras then it‚Äôs more likely going to be the hub or the App on your phone. 

Hope this helps some."	positive
2238	1459289784	lifestyle	5	"I guess I could complain, but just minor little stuff. I would bet if I had a different system, there would be things I would want different. The problem is, once you invest in a system and a couple cameras, you are pretty much stuck with it. I had to stop looking once I decided on Arlo or I‚Äôd keep thinking I should have gone with a different system. 
The app works well. I would wish for: a battery warning (I don‚Äôt always notice the gauge on the camera screen), the ability for more individual camera control like home and away modes and schedule settings, and better integration with Alexa (it is hit or miss whether it works). 
I think this is a good system with a good app, but do your research if you need a specific function that may or may not be available on Arlo or another system."	positive
2239	1459289784	lifestyle	3	The app is adequate but not much more.   I do like the ARLO system.    I find my app doesn‚Äôt monitor and control it as well as it could.   It doesn‚Äôt really monitor battery life for any of the cameras.   If I‚Äôm  charging one of the cameras it‚Äôs not unusual that it shows no charge on the battery until it‚Äôs fully charged.   Also, one of my cameras is always discharging excessively because it doesn‚Äôt respond to my command on the app to reduce its sensitivity.   Also, I can only turn off the alerts for periods of 24 hours or less. Why can‚Äôt I turn off the alerts and turn them on when I want to.   Part of the problem might be that my instructions for this system came on one sheet of paper?????   For what I paid for the system I should have received a manual so I don‚Äôt have to learn it on the fly!   In general though, the system works well overall.   I was in Europe for 2 weeks and was able to see around my house on my phone.  Wow!	positive
2240	1459289784	lifestyle	2	The cameras take too long to notify you there is motion, it takes 15 seconds to get the feedback, I wouldn‚Äôt rate this under any type of security camera with that response time, the fingerprint identification almost never works, i continually need to get out of the app and reenter for the fingerprint ID to work, there should also be an option to take the notification off for more than 24 hours, I would like it to record but not let me know I need to turn off the notifications every single day with no option of turning off for a longer specified amount of time like a normal electronic device will allow, I will keep trying to change the notifications through my phones settings possibly instead of through the apps settings. I don‚Äôt believe I will buy more cameras of this brand because of these reasons, a 15 second delay on any electronic device is unacceptable, what is the ring doorbells response time I wonder, I will research to see if I‚Äôm being unreasonable	negative
2241	1459289784	lifestyle	2	"I am very disappointed in the way that the app works now. I have used Arlo Cameras probably for about 2 to 3 years now and when I first bought them they were great but since they‚Äôve ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù their System or whatever it was that they ‚Äúupgraded‚Äù, they don‚Äôt seem to work as well.
1. The App lags when I open it.

 2. When I go to review the live view of my camera feed, they lag to start up.

 3. At times when I open the live feed, my night vision is turned off so then I have to close out the entire app and open it back again and go back to the live view and occasionally the night vision will turn back on.

4. The cameras or app, which ever it may be, lags when something moves in the detection zone and sometimes I won‚Äôt catch the entire action until it‚Äôs too late.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, they still work pretty decent and I think it‚Äôs very handy that I can place them about anywhere within a certain distance of the base station so I‚Äôm not limited to what is secured on my property. 
One major feature that I wish they would integrate into the system, is to be able to ask Siri or Google, which ever phone system you have, to turn the cameras on and off instead of having to open the app and turn them on and off individually.
Yes I have a few complaints about the system and there are still a few bugs that need to probably be fixed, but otherwise I still think it is a pretty decent system."	positive
2242	1459289784	lifestyle	5	"My cameras were working fine. Since the latest upgrade my video setting selectionsh HB have been reduced to only brightness. I no longer have a page to check motion or a page to select area to record on any of my cameras.  What have you done? Why were we not notified?  Also it appears the detection sensitivity has been reduced & what I do get is delayed so if I did have an intruder or someone at the door they would be gone b4 I saw them.  There are other selection areas missing. Is this
permanent ? You know there are problems, why aren‚Äôt we notified? You sure can contact me when you have something to sell.  I recommended these cameras to my neighbor, if you have reduced the quality so you can make your doorbells work better, I am going to tell him  & anyone else that asks to buy another brand. Not happy."	negative
2243	1459289784	lifestyle	1	"As others have mentioned, I have no idea how there are so many recent five star reviews of this app. I invested close to $1000 to get cameras set up around my new house because we moved onto a busy street. The camera quality is fantastic - but I think people are getting confused when they are reviewing this app. The quality of the hardware isn‚Äôt in question. It‚Äôs this abhorrent application. 

When I first installed the system a few months ago there were many frustrations in how slow and non-responsive the app can be. I‚Äôd get a notification that motion had triggered a camera, but I had to wait up to ten minutes to see the clip that triggered it. THIS SHOULD BE INSTANT and the fact that it isn‚Äôt is just so mindnumbingly atrocious. Do you understand that? If somebody is in an area of concern around my house I need to be able to see it IMMEDIATELY. Even tapping into the live feed could take up to a minute. 

So the app got updated recently. Guess what? It‚Äôs worse. Far worse. The app constantly crashes itself, I‚Äôm constantly logged out, and all of the previous problems I had with the app are now worse. 

How is this excusable? How do you push out an app update which is so obviously broken? Is nobody else giving Arlo this feedback? Is it not being taken seriously? I seriously can‚Äôt wrap my mind around it. It‚Äôs enough to make me consider reinvesting in a different ecosystem. Even if it means throwing $1000 of equipment into a trash can."	negative
2244	1459289784	lifestyle	3	"It's the classic ""when it works, it's great"". The wireless cameras sometimes disconnect from the service, such as after a power outage. *sometimes* restarting the base station with the app will reconnect them. If it doesn't, you have to open and close the battery compartment on each camera to restart it, then it usually reconnects. Unless it disconnected due to low battery, then you have to replace the battery. But the low battery emails are rarely sent in my experience. I haven't received one in a long time.  But the main problem is if you're not home, you can't restart he cameras to force them to reconnect, so you're left with no camera if the base station restart doesn't fix it. I have a ring doorbell also, it always reconnects to the network on its own if there's a power outage, never once had to do it manually, so I know it's possible to have a device that works that way."	negative
2245	1459289784	lifestyle	1	"My experience with Arlo has been terrible from day one. Yet, they manage to out do themselves with each subsequent interaction. At first it was just the terrible customer service but now the hardware & software have stopped working. 

The camera doesn‚Äôt capture all motion footage so last week when someone broke into my car(parked in driveway), instead of having footage of their face walking up the LONG driveway I just have footage of them breaking the car window with their back to the camera. 

Last week I wasn‚Äôt able to download any footage from the library onto my phone. Today (after most recent update) I‚Äôm unable to login to the app because it doesn‚Äôt recognize my device(the same device I‚Äôve always used to access the app). The app asks to send a push notification to my phone or an email- of course neither ever arrive. 

When I call customer service I get placed on hold for 65 minutes while the customer support rep ‚Äúsearches‚Äù for a supervisor, that is until the line disconnects(which of course it does). Do I get a follow up call? Of course not, despite the rep confirming my phone number at the very beginning of the phone call. 

To date, I‚Äôve probably spent over 15 hours on the phone with ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù. At this point I‚Äôll be switching to a company with an  established history. I guess this is what happens when a ‚Äústartup‚Äù outsources all the manufacturing, software development, and customer service to other countries."	negative
2246	1459289784	lifestyle	1	1 star because I had to select something.  This is my first time writing a negative review.  I don‚Äôt know what Arlo has done, however, this new upgrade is horrible and does not work.  My cameras are no longer recording/capturing as they did the week before CHRISTmas.  If they record any activity now, the recordings are over an hour apart.  I have a screened in porch, and you have to open a door to come on the porch before you get to the front door.   People can now be at my front door, ringing my doorbell and they haven‚Äôt been captured, nor am I receiving a signal.  This is no longer a secure system.  I‚Äôve invested a lot of money in this system, including purchasing a system for someone else, extra cameras and 3 of the rechargeable battery systems and extra batteries. What ever Arlo has done, it should be undone in order for our cameras to again record within seconds/ minutes when movement is detected.  I DON‚ÄôT HAVE MONEY TO WASTE  THAT I‚ÄôVE NOW INVESTED INTO THIS SYSTEM.  LIKE OTHERS, THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY INTERNET,  AS EVERYTHING ELSE WORKS PERFECTLY! PLEASE FIX!	positive
2247	1459289784	lifestyle	4	"I love the Arlo system. I have one for my office building, another system for my house and one for my mother‚Äôs house. The one with my mom is so important as she has dementia and has aides every day but not ALL day. I can make sure the aides show up, fo what they‚Äôre supposed to and take good care of my mom.

My office building Arlo provides my staff and our patients piece of mind just as my home system does. It‚Äôs not going to stop anyone from doing something irregular or terrible but it may make them think twice. And of course, you have a recording of it if someone chooses to do the wrong thing.

Only drawback is that often the desktop and mobile app don‚Äôt show the live stream. Something to do with Flash player of which I cannot seem to fix as it works sometimes and then other times, not. Quite frustrating especially when I need it for my Mom."	positive
2248	1459289784	lifestyle	1	I‚Äôm currently using this app with a set of 3 Arlo Pro 3‚Äôs. Let‚Äôs start with my biggest gripe: The library tab. It is almost impossible to get the list to refresh. I will get a notification about motion detected, but when I go to view said motion the clip isn‚Äôt shown in the library. Sometimes a force close will cause the library pane to update, but most times it won‚Äôt until later that day. This is infuriating and defeats the entire point of these cameras for me. Which brings me to my second gripe: Notifications. My cameras can be triggered by the wind blowing multiple times a day. I have turned the sensitivity down, but it still happens and now I have less reliability detecting people/animal motion. As a side effect of this, my batteries that are supposed to last 1-2 months in areas that don‚Äôt see a lot of traffic now only last 1-2 weeks. My free trial is about to expire, and if I‚Äôm being honest I can‚Äôt see a reason to pay for the added features that seem to be broken (or at least not fully baked).	negative
2249	1459289784	lifestyle	3	"I think the hardware product is quite good. The cameras are robust and image clear. Except for the battery life, no real complaints. Though setup and device adding is easy, I find the rest of the app quite frustrating.

The main device view is ok, but individual control of the camera settings are not intuitive or efficient. Often you have to spend a minute poking around to find what you are looking for. In addition, the software has very unpredictable motion detection- operates only inside of a ""test"" mode. This is a primary function of any setup and needs too be more easily accessible and feature rich.

There is no option to select which base station is primary if you have more than one, which forces you to manually do a remove, turn off base then add dance. 

There is no option to set record trigger in and out times, and no options for video format when you need to save a video.

There is also no method to work around false positives for cats or dogs etc. Though I believe there is motion masking in the premium version. I'm not confident enough to pay and find out.

Overall I would recommend this as a basic first setup or if you have remote areas you cant run wires to. But after 3 yrs I upgraded the majority of my home security to a wired setup and just use these in my back yard."	positive
2250	1288415553	lifestyle	2	There‚Äôs no point to having a camera that pans if it doesn‚Äôt follow the object it‚Äôs detecting.  You get an ‚Äúevent‚Äù notice that something or someone is moving around a room and it‚Äôll show you that person or animal briefly, but then the camera starts jerking spastically left or right like it‚Äôs blindly seeking the subject.  I get video after video where the camera just goes the other way and stops following the subject completely while they (or it) wanders off.  Even when the camera does stay on the subject it whips left and right so many times that the video‚Äôs unwatchable.   One of my cameras, which are identical, does well in low light and the other doesn‚Äôt seem to have any IR function at all.  I usually don‚Äôt have trouble connecting to each camera when I try to watch its images, but it‚Äôs not a very fast response time, either, before you can watch live video.  About 5 seconds.  You can remotely aim the cameras, kind of, but they‚Äôre susceptible to the same off-center jerking around when you do.  Overall these are good for still images but essentially worthless for getting video clips because they don‚Äôt stay on subject and won‚Äôt stop ‚Äúseeking‚Äù when they detect something.  And by the way, there are not multiple people or animals in the room to confuse it.  It‚Äôs got one subject to follow indoors, and it can‚Äôt even do that.	negative
2251	1288415553	lifestyle	2	"The picture is crystal clear, and the features that it‚Äôs SUPPOSED to come with sound amazing. Eventually, it could be a great product! However, there is a laundry list of flaws, and the forums will attest to that. For me personally, the flaws I encountered were: dropped streams CONSTANTLY (reliable WiFi, promise), screen timeout after 10 mins on google home or a few hours on iPhone (take note those wanting constant streaming like for baby monitor or constant security monitoring- there is no way to lengthen the time the screen is active, I confirmed this with their own tech support), camera would move randomly for no apparent reason, motion detection alerts never- not once- actually alerted anyone (2 people on account, one google pixel 3 and one iPhone XS MAX) even though I confirmed several times with several people that all push and notifications were active both within the wise app and on the phones themselves, and customer service seems either burnt out or just not all there. When I asked about the 10 minute screen timeout time on the google hub they said I could simply ask google to bring up the camera every 10 mins for hours on end..... um..... what? How is that even a logical response? 

TL;DR wyze has great potential. Too many kinks to work out for now."	positive
2252	1288415553	lifestyle	3	I rarely write reviews - this product deserve a score of 20/10 score . Just incredible for the price and how well it works . Just a couple things that bother me , wish there was an external antenna or really just anything that would increase the connectivity . Biggest step for improvement would be add a grid to the motion detection zone selection as my camera is facing my street oddly and in order to have it go off for my driveway I need to have it in the street and this goes off for every car , if I could be able to individual select each grid box and mold the zone to the geography of my perimeter then that would be amazing. Maybe a louder speaker for the voice and or an alarm tone that can be activated . Would love a Mac version or just app form for the Mac as I my phone and computer are my only devices and I need to use my phone to call etc whilst my computer could stream .  other then that I can‚Äôt complain for the cost and I will definitely be purchasing more . Definitely needs an alarm option to be played aloud . Also I don‚Äôt know why when it records in 1080p to the sd card there are glitches and motion blur like it‚Äôs recording locally why should there by a lag in FPS ?	positive
2253	1288415553	lifestyle	4	"If you‚Äôre on the fence about Wyze, trust me when I say it‚Äôs worth it! It works well enough with Alexa, though not great. Still, it's fantastic with IFTTT! The quality and auto-night vision are also better than you‚Äôd expect.

I can only give the app 4 stars because, while it is good for watching a live stream, it‚Äôs missing a few features. You can change the quality from 720p to 360p but even the lowest setting the video is still very watchable if you don‚Äôt need to zoom in too much. There are several automations to play with; more than enough for any smart homes. The camera load time is adequate at 3-4 seconds, just a tad bit slower than my Nest (which is a lot more expensive). 

All this being said, watching a playback of previously recorded video is so difficult to use. The way you have to FF and RW is not even close to being helpful in finding a certain event. It would be great if the developers added a ‚ÄúSkip 15 seconds‚Äù feature or whatever period of time. It would make life so much easier than trying to use only the little slider in the current app."	positive

I got an echo show and decided to try this product because of reviews and price. I couldn‚Äôt believe all this product could do and how everything worked with my phone. I can check in on all three, I get alerts for noise and motion and with one touch I can see them it saves recordings of events. I can watch all my kids in one place. It has amazing night vision and you can control everything. It has both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. I don‚Äôt think you can buy a carbon monoxide detector this cheap. I can also see them when I am not at home and I can see them on my echo show and any other devices I want. This product does so much but the best part is there are NO OTHER FEES. I tell everyone about this product. Thank you to whoever made this product please don‚Äôt change a thing, please don‚Äôt add all the extra monthly charges. This is the best product I ever bought for my kids. If I could give 10 stars I would!!!!!	positive
2255	1288415553	lifestyle	4	I found out about this through some research and took the chance and got 4 for my house. Keep in mind you‚Äôre paying roughly $25 for each one if you buy them in twos. That being said, you get A LOT for what you‚Äôre paying for. Good quality but small and lightweight, and easy to use and setup. My only issue is that the camera gets set off every time it detects any kind of motion. I get notifications pretty often and a lot of times it‚Äôs because a bug or a bird flew into the view of the camera. I know you can set how sensitive you want the camera to be but I wish it could distinguish an animal or a tree branch from a human body or face. If there was an update for that feature then I‚Äôd give it 5 stars. Still, with that setback these little cameras are amazing. I bought 4 of them and one of my old neighbors saw me setting them up and I told her about them. Now she bought 2. I showed my sister and she‚Äôs going to get a few as well. My girlfriend works at a shelter and they need cameras so I also recommended them to her because of the price and ease of use.	positive
2256	1288415553	lifestyle	4	So I bought these cameras and I must admit the picture quality is great and I love the sound notifications which is different than a previous system I used. The set up was simple and took only a few moments. I love that the cameras can tilt which makes it easier to find the best view. The only flaw is within the app itself. I wish it had a feature like my previous brand did, which was when I leave my house the cameras auto arm based on my cell phone location and a radius that I got to determine. I work crazy hours that change daily so it's hard to do the scheduled time period for notifications. Or another option would be to have something on the home screen of the app where you could arm all the cameras at once (or individually if the owner wants). If one of those two options became available, I would be extremely happy! I am happy though so far and look forward to future app updates which hopefully provide more options like these.	positive

The setup is easy, the product looks and feels nice, and the video quality is great. The problem: it consistently doesn‚Äôt work. The video just doesn‚Äôt load and you have to unplug it in order to get it to work again. I‚Äôm rooting for this product, it‚Äôs early days and I‚Äôm sure the tram will figure it out, but until they do I have to leave this review at 3 stars. We‚Äôre using it as a baby monitor so if it doesn‚Äôt work any percent of the time it basically doesn‚Äôt work. 

ORIGINAL REVIEW
I‚Äôd be happy with this product if it had cost be $100. It‚Äôs comparable to top of the line camera products, it‚Äôs clear that the team has put a lot of thought into how people would use it. The setup was incredibly easy, the camera looks and feels sturdier than I expected due to the price point, and the app has been flawless for us thus far. Even the audio works well enough. We‚Äôll be buying a few more of the cameras now that we‚Äôve had a chance to test this, and are excited to see what other products the team comes out with in the future."	positive

2259	1288415553	lifestyle	3	"Wyze makes a great camera and the value is way beyond their competitors. The app itself is decent but I wish there were a few more customization options. 

For instance, I wish you could customize the notification sounds so a person alert is different than a contact sensor or a text message. I also wish the software didn‚Äôt have a cooling off period after a vehicle pulls into my yard. I only have notifications setup for people alerts and if a car pulls up and a motion is detected, I miss the person alert when the person gets out. I also wish you could easily mute notifications for a time. When I‚Äôm working in my garage and I know I‚Äôm going to be in and out, I don‚Äôt want it alerting me every time I come back to cut a piece of wood but I do want the camera recording in case someone decides to wander in a steal my tools. A ‚Äúmute notifications for an hour‚Äù button would help me. 

What they have works and it‚Äôs a great little system all together. Just wish they could add a few of these features."	positive
2260	1288415553	lifestyle	4	"I was in the market for a indoor camera because I get very paranoid when I don‚Äôt have an eye on my belongings. I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot since I was going to be moving at least 3 times before actually settling in one location. In comes Wyze.

This is great for its price, actually better than I thought it would be and with the free storage! Super easy to set up, app is super easy to use. 

The reason I give it a 4 stars is because of the audio delay it has. When I watch it live, it does have some audio delay (about 1-2 seconds). At first I thought it could have been my WiFi connection, but I have one in my living room (right by the router) and it still has the lag. But the biggest reason from the audio delay is when you play it back and need to record it and save it. The audio delay is about 1-2 minutes delay. Or actually not a delay but it‚Äôs 1-2 minutes ahead of the video play. This makes me have to record a minute or two extra (if I need to show it to someone and takes up more memory than I need to. 

Please take a look and see if there is any update to the firmware that can fix this issue. I know there are many people experiencing this as well. 

Overall, I still recommend this to many people because it‚Äôs great for its price. But I do have friends that would rather use other services even if they have to pay more to make sure it‚Äôs all smooth"	positive
2261	1288415553	lifestyle	2	"I bought three cameras to use at my office for a little extra security. They were easy to set up and the video quality is pretty good. Unfortunately all of them disconnect almost daily. Since they all do it at the same time, it may be a network issue, but I have verified that the internet is working (by logging in remotely to my office computer if I am not there). They must each be unplugged to reboot, and reconnect easily, but then they have to be readjusted because they moved, or I have to move furniture to unplug at the wall. A PAIN! When they disconnect at night or on the weekend, I am SOL. 
It took me over a week to get an email response from the help desk who wants me to download and separate app to use as a diagnostic tool (in all my free time).
It‚Äôs a shame, because if the worked properly, I would be thrilled.
I also wish there was a PC/Windows app as I use my phone to TALK on during the day, but would like to have one of the cameras up at the same time.
PS. I did upgrade to the new firmware a couple of days ago and still lost them yesterday."	positive
2262	1288415553	lifestyle	3	Let me start by saying I‚Äôm super bad at anything technical/computer, but I‚Äôm a doctor, so I‚Äôm not stupid, either! This camera was a little more difficult to get started than another cheaper brand. I like the full scanning, though, and overall I‚Äôm getting the views I want. What‚Äôs difficult is I have no idea what many of the icons mean, and there are no explanations. I still haven‚Äôt figured out why I‚Äôm not getting notifications and if it‚Äôs possible to get more than 12 sec videos. Also, when looking at the videos I don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm getting 2 of the same video every time. I think it has something to do with ‚Äúthe rules‚Äù, but there‚Äôs no explanation of what the choices mean in that menu. There are a few explanations, but I don‚Äôt understand a lot of the lingo in them and have yet to find good info online. I just wish there was a booklet that explains what each menu item means, or an easy way to find something online. Any help would be appreciated!	positive
2263	1288415553	lifestyle	4	"I am impressed with the video quality and ease of use for a device at this price point! Even the packaging was thoughtful, concise and well done! I bought a second one because of the first one‚Äôs performance plus the 25‚Äô power cords - I have them 180-upside down facing out windows to monitor outdoor movement. Both have SD cards in them and setup was quick and easy. 

I‚Äôve been trying various settings and determined that the Notifications are the most useful - except they are too short to see what‚Äôs really going on. Since I‚Äôm using these as security cameras, when motion is detected is what I want to see and not try to hunt down in a recording from a timeline that‚Äôs not easy to read on an iPhone and replays at ‚Äúreal time‚Äù pace. 

Longer ‚Äúclips‚Äù captured with Notifications is needed. Ideally, setting my own time length of these clips would be preferable! Then I might not even need hours of recorded video of ‚Äúnothing happening‚Äù."	positive
2264	1288415553	lifestyle	3	"Update - This app fails to stay logged in over Marriott (Autograph Collection) Hotel‚Äôs WiFi. I have to authenticate over LTE and switch to hotel wifi to view feed.  If I continue using wifi only, it logs me out.  Amazon‚Äôs cloud cam doesn‚Äôt have this issue.  Deducing one additional star.

Everything from the setup, control, settings, operation is very polished.  They clearly thought through each design and tested their stuff.  The device and app is much better than ones produced by multi billion dollar companies.  

I have a feature request however -

1. Shorter cool down period for cloud recording. I‚Äôd pay a few bucks a month for this feature.
2. Clarification on how sd card recording is surfaced when it‚Äôs configured to record motion only.  For example. Does it show up in notification timeline if there‚Äôs recording during cool down period for cloud recording?  Or is it only surfaced in playback view?
3. More intuitive controls for playback UI when it‚Äôs configured to record events only. 
4. Ability to weight time spent at each way point.
5. People detection to reduce detection noise
6. Ability to mute the camera from talking.  Not sure how often it talks like it did during setup.  Does it talk when WiFi losss internet connection?  Useful when I‚Äôm out of town and don‚Äôt want the camera asking for something over and over scaring our neighbors.
7. Ability to invert touch / swipe control to move camera."	positive
2265	1288415553	lifestyle	5	"I purchased 3 cameras and mounted one facing my driveway, one on a covered back porch and one in a shed.  The setup was straight forward and all 3 cameras connected immediately.  Thus far I have had no connection issues. 
   For the price point, the image quality is well worth it. I like being able to set the detection zone and to only get notifications when people are detected. I installed SD cards which record full videos during motion detection. 
   The only issue I‚Äôve had so far was when I tried to connect my shed camera to a WiFi extender to strengthen my signal, I was unable to. Even though my signal is not as strong as I‚Äôd like in my shed, I‚Äôve never lost connectivity. (I‚Äôm still looking for a solution to the WiFi extender issue). 
   Great product!!  Keep up the good work!  I‚Äôve already recommended them to several of my friends."	positive
2266	1288415553	lifestyle	5	"Seems like people have posted reviews for multiple things here. I am reviewing the Wyze cam 1080p indoor wireless camera for 25 bucks. The camera was very easy to connect to wifi as soon as I remembered my wifi password and for the app... I have never experienced such a consistently functioning app for a product that was under 200 dollars and without a stupid monthly fee. Absolutely cannot beat it!!! I have learned to always check reviews on apps  that need to work in order for a product to function. I have never been kicked off app and have never had issues connecting. I have only had the camera and app for a couple weeks and I know it‚Äôs only a matter of time till an update changes all that but I am very happy so far. Might update if things change for the worst. 
25 bucks... return if u don‚Äôt like"	positive
2267	1288415553	lifestyle	2	"Just because they can, why do app developers have the insatiable need to constantly add complexity to their products?
1. Choose a camera
2. Adjust its viewing rotation
3. Adjust its sensitivity
4. Adjust its area of detection
5. Adjust the recording length
6. Want to see a recorded video? Pick one from the list.

How difficult is that?  Unfortunately it appears this app has fallen into a black hole of multiple programmers with specific tasks having their work thrown together into a rat‚Äôs nest of knotted interfacing.  

Want to choose a camera?  That and number 6 are the only simple acts this app offers.
 
Everything else on my list requires a rabbit hole adventure through multiple levels of programming that involve non-intuitive screen taps (completed in the proper order, no less) and judgment calls about word and icon meaning.  I feel I‚Äôve fallen into a Microsoft 1980s time warp... I‚Äôm still trying to discover how to adjust number 5, if that‚Äôs even an option.

Everything on the list could easily be located on one screen. Every other feature the programmers want to add could be put on another. 

Please, please, please clean up the interface to the point where those who didn‚Äôt write the app and are unfamiliar with all of its intricate pathways, have a shot at getting what they need the camera to do... which is a beautifully designed device, btw. 

The camera gets 5 stars, the app gets less than zero.   Wyze ends up with the average from me."	positive
2268	1288415553	lifestyle	4	"As at 27th Feb 2018: Despite the crunchy previous update which forced me to do a hard reboot to the camera (which said it was permanently locked in a firmware update) the system is now up and running and much better than ever. It now gives the option of reformatting the inserted SD card!!! Nice!! Much quicker loading response. Recommended again!

 Previous review:

Unfortunately the latest app update (15th feb  2018) along with the firmware update has made one of my cameras (the one that I updated the firmware on) stuck in the ‚Äúauthenticating 2/3‚Äù mode. The software says it‚Äôs not connected as it‚Äôs stuck in this continual loop. I tried hitting the reset button on the bottom of the camera but it announced that it was not possible during a firmware update. Please resolve ASAP. It was great for the price before this change.

Previous review:

Previous issue fixed. Decent camera for the money. App and firmware improving each time but still not quite as good as the Yi camera/app... however very good value for money. Developers seem to be keen to fix the teething problems on this new product.

Previous review as at 9th Dec 2017:

It's stuck in at ""authenticating 2/3"". No longer works. Camera can't be viewed at all. My installed firmware appears to be higher than the latest version that this ""update"" indicates!! What's going on? Please resolve ASAP."	positive
2269	1288415553	lifestyle	3	"About the app, I set the notification alert to low sensitivity for both motion and sound. Yet I still got plenty of notifications even if there was very little motion or very little sound. Also, I wish that since play back is recorded continuously on an SD card in the camera, that time lapse shouldn‚Äôt be something that needs to be set up every time one is desired. It should be something that could be loaded in real time SINCE all the video has already been recorded onto the camera‚Äôs memory card.
About the camera... $20 for a Wi-Fi enabled HD camera? Who wouldn‚Äôt get this! I didn‚Äôt have any issues setting it up or using it BUT I did start experiencing issues with connecting to it a month or so after starting to use it (it would say that it‚Äôs ‚Äúgetting video data‚Äù and stay there then restart the connection and do it repeatedly); I eventually got used to the issues and just tried to connect later each time."	positive
2270	1288415553	lifestyle	2	The only reason I rated this item 2 stars is because of its functionality as a camera at a cheap price. However, I‚Äôve yet to come across a more frustrating system for detecting motion, and most of the issues are fixable via software. First off, there are things that trigger motion on Wyze cameras that don‚Äôt on a Ring, Blink or other device. Lights turning on and off, for example, can trigger a motion event, as does a slight shift in lighting due to a passing car‚Äôs headlights shining a tiny bit of light through a window blind. I‚Äôm constantly having to open the app and check what‚Äôs going on only to find nothing actually moved. Then there‚Äôs the response time, which is even more embarrassing. I can walk in front of that camera, get in my car, drive a mile down the street and THEN it‚Äôll tell me that it detected motion. Someone could literally come in, search for and unplug the camera and it won‚Äôt send a notification in time. These issues need to be addressed ASAP.	negative
2271	1288415553	lifestyle	3	"These are great cameras and worked amazingly. I have 5 around my house. Occasionally they send out an update that weakens performance or just make functionality awful. These last few updates did that. The night vision quality has gotten worse. The cameras haven‚Äôt moved since I installed them so I know nothing has changed in my house but now the night vision quality has gotten so bad I can‚Äôt really see anything like I use to be able to. 
Also why did you put on/off buttons on main page of app? Who is ever needing to turn off the cameras? Always on and recording is the sole point and reason of existence of these cameras. Stop tinkering with the camera quality and adding features no one needs. Adding all this extra crap is hindering their performance and slowing them down. Make them always connect better and make the pan camera stop randomly spinning around."	negative
2272	1288415553	lifestyle	1	"The camera is good and the setup is a breeze compared to other IP cameras.  However, there are few major problems/limitations with this app for my use and apparently many others now that I‚Äôm searching on the issues.

With my old Foscam cameras and app, I could monitor all of my cameras, real-time.  Wyze only lets you see one real-time camera stream at a time.  This is a major oversight in the development, in my opinion.  People who monitor their cameras would typically like to see all of their cameras at once and then decide if they need to focus on a single camera.  

The second problem I‚Äôve encountered is that I am using an older iPad 2, which does have the iOS required (9.0+) by Wyze, but the latest app (2.0) says it is incompatible with this ipad.  If you are going to use an iOS device as a baby monitor or for home security monitor, you most likely do not want to use your new iPad and leave the app running all the time, relegating your new iPad to only being used as a monitor.  This is the perfect role for an older iPad, freeing up your new equipment for other things.  Again, I‚Äôm running iOS version higher than required in the Wyze literature but apparently Wyze app will not run on the iPad 2, which all other camera monitoring apps download and run fine on (Foscam, FoscamPro, TinyCam, etc.).  Again, I think this is an oversight in this young company‚Äôs plan. 

The app would have 5 stars from me if these two issues were resolved."	positive
2273	1288415553	lifestyle	1	I purchased these cameras because a coworker recommended them. I looked into them and was surprised that these cameras had all the features of much more expensive cameras. Sadly these cameras are not reliable at all! I bought one pop up and one pan camera and have had to deal with nothing but frustration since. Every time I try to connect to the cameras it fails and for no reason. I‚Äôll connect one second and then try to connect a minute later and it will repeatedly fail. I have tried everything killing the application, logging out, restarting the devices, taking part in their beta application and firmware updates, and nothing makes it so I can view them whenever I want! What‚Äôs funny is these cameras pack in a lot of awesome features and fail at the most important one which is being able to view them after getting an alert! Don‚Äôt buy these cameras until their application works as it is suppose to. I honestly am surprised these cameras have such good reviews on Amazon‚Äôs and the App Store.	positive
2274	1288415553	lifestyle	5	"I have 3 Wyze cams, 2 pan cams and 1 stationary. The pictures are great even at night. Never had any connection issues. I replaced my old router with a Tenda WiFi mesh system. Works great with it. Second best thing I did, the first was buying the Wyze cams. 
 The pan cams work as baby monitors in the two twins rooms. Wonderful for keeping an eye out when they are sleeping and at night. The only issue I have is having to use two iPhones or iPads in order to hear sound in both rooms at the same time. This is annoying. I wish there was a cheaper way around this. I have old iPads that won‚Äôt work due to needing IOS 9.0 or higher. The grouping ability is nice but sound from only one Wyze device at a time is an issue. I still give it 5 stars. You won‚Äôt regret it."	positive
2275	1288415553	lifestyle	4	I was looking for a security system that was cheap and reliable but most of them were too expensive and you needed to buy a hard drive and run cables through your attic, So I decided to buy one wyze cam and try it out and it worked great so I bought several. The only downside is that if you want to install the wyze cams outside you need to purchase usb cables and they can get pretty expensive but compared to other cameras it‚Äôs well worth it. The wyze cams would be way better if you could stream them all together on fire tv rather then each individual. The only thing I could say that‚Äôs bad about the wyze cams is that if your internet isn‚Äôt the best they will cut out sometimes and you could lose some footage. But if you buy a WiFi extender they are great outdoors.	positive
2276	1288415553	lifestyle	5	To be honest I wish I could work for this company. I follow their forums and they are very in touch with their users/customers unlike anything I have experienced before. They are always innovating to create new things for their existing high value product line at such a great ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù price point and they actually listen to their customers by demonstrating this in doing what the customers ask for as much as possible. It is going to be interesting to see how they disrupt Ring and Nest‚Äôs market share once they start getting more mainstream and releasing similar outdoor products. Kudos to the people at Wyze for making a high value product that is always getting better, keep doing what you are doing!!! üòÄüòÄüòÄ	positive
2277	1288415553	lifestyle	1	I bought 2 cameras before a 3-month business trip. 1 camera was borderline impossible to set up, and 1 week into my trip, 7 hours from home, it went down. Only way to get it back up and running? Unplug it and plug it back in, which requires that I go home, and I‚Äôm home...I don‚Äôt need the camera. The notifications function doesn‚Äôt work, as I‚Äôve never been notified once of the detection of motion, sound, etc., even though the app is 100% set up to provide notifications. The app frequently refuses to load; if I want to check out a live camera feed for a couple seconds here and there, sometimes the app just shows me the spinny circle thing, like it‚Äôs trying to load...but it never does. For the price, the stuff is decent...but if you want reliability, functionality, and a support/tech team that will actually respond to inquiries about their junk products and how to make them work as promised...spend more money, and don‚Äôt buy Wyze anything.	positive
2278	1288415553	lifestyle	1	"The cameras are good for the price but the Wyze app is the weak link that will prevent me from purchasing more than the two cameras I currently have until certain things are improved.

My main complaint is that the home screen does not display a live stream of all the cameras at once. You only see a snapshot of the last time you connected to each one. You must manually select a camera, wait for it to connect and stream, the go up a level and do the same for each subsequent one. Even my old Foscams have the ability to display a summary of all the cameras on one screen as live thumbnails. I won't add anymore Wyze cams until this is ability is added.

The next really annoying thing about the app is there's no way to schedule notifications or restrict event detection to specific days. I don't need a notification when I'm in the house telling me that I'm moving around or making a noise. I have to manually disable notifications or event detection then remember to turn them on again when I leave which I usually forget to do, rendering the whole thing pointless. The ideal option would be to disable these features when a phone is on the same network as the cams. This would have to be per cam though as some could be located remotely on other networks.

The Wyze Cam Pan camera has a few annoying quirks but I'll restrict my comments here to just the app."	negative
2279	1288415553	lifestyle	4	"I like the cameras but the app seemed inconsistent. The notifications used to work and my problem is they were too sensitive at the least sensitive position and I used to get way too many. Now that problem is somewhat solved by having no notifications at all even though the events keep being logged in the app! I only knew about them afterwards when I manually checked them. Even disabling and re-enabling notifications did not work. 

I found out afterwards that the account has a separate means of turning off notifications but the app does not tell the user that info when trying to configure those notifications in the camera settings. It makes sense when sharing cameras but not when there is only one user."	negative
2280	1288415553	lifestyle	4	"UPDATE: I have gotten my camera and it is great! The only reason I have knocked off a star is because I have gotten a couple notifications, one of which was motion, and the notification will not open. Other notifications will open for me to view the clip, but when these erroneous notifications occur, the pull up a page that seems to be loading a video and is unfortunately not. There are also some major improvements that could be made to the UI. 
Nonetheless, I am very impressed with the quality and functionality of this device at such a low price point. 

ORIGINAL: I am giving 5 stars for what I‚Äôve seen on this BEFORE getting the camera. Will update when I have received camera and am able to verify app functionality."	positive
2281	1288415553	lifestyle	4	"1) need multiple (at least two) alert (notification) schedules - now I have to workaround with manual camera on/off in the app
2) when using live monitoring, no alerts/notifications are generated. Would love the app to somehow draw your attention (e.g. sound) to the screen if motion/sound is detected.
3) would love an option to have the notifications working even if event recording is disabled
4) Apple Watch notifications immediately show you the large picture of what‚Äôs going on, sometimes it helps to save time by removing the need to go to the app and check live feed or recording, would love to have the same notifications format for the iPhone/iPad (not sure if iOS allows that, though)"	positive
2282	1288415553	lifestyle	3	"Overall pretty good for $20, I would buy more if the app was better. When you have it set to record continuously to local storage, there should be some indication of motion on the time scrubber... if you knew something happened last night, you‚Äôd basically have to watch the whole night or randomly scroll through trying to find the event. 
Also, if you only locally record on motion, it is very difficult to slide the time scrub to the little thin blue line that shows there was an event. You can press play on times with no recording and it will play a blank screen, when it should only play the recorded events and move between them without showing the blank spots in between. If these things were fixed on the app I would definitely give it five stars. Thanks."	positive
2283	1288415553	lifestyle	1	There is no power button on the Wyze pan cam itself, so you have to use the app to power off the camera.  So first you have to wait (sometimes a couple minutes) to establish a connection between your phone and the cam, then select ‚Äòpower off‚Äô from the menu.  Nearly 100% of the time, this results in the app ‚Äòthinking‚Äô about it (again, often for a minute or more) before finally saying ‚ÄúOperation Failed‚Äù!   What operation? Kill the power. Plain and simple.  I have no problem pointing and zooming the camera from the app, so clearly there is a connection.  Other menu items work.  Why is ‚Äòpower off‚Äô suddenly such a complex ‚Äúoperation‚Äù.  I just updated to the latest firmware this morning, hopeful that this would address the issue, but no.  I have to physically unplug the camera to shut it down every time. How stupid and lame that it can‚Äôt perform this simple task.	negative
2284	1288415553	lifestyle	5	Despite what some are claiming the latest Wyze inexpensive camera flat out blows away all the no name Chinese designed similarly priced or even more expensive Chinese cameras many of which phone home to China and literally spy on you, have back doors, etc. Wyze cameras are designed in the USA as are their apps and it shows. Some have complained about WiFi issues, signal strength, etc. but my Wyze camera, despite being far from my WiFi access point, is showing 97% signal strength and has been rock solid. It just works with zero issues which is more than I can say for all the similar crappy Chinese branded cameras I‚Äôve tried.	neutral
2285	1288415553	lifestyle	5	"My experience with Wyze cameras is a love and hate relationship. For the price it is the most affordable camera out in the home or office security camera market. I would highly recommend this camera for anyone wanting or needing security camera at home or office. The camera is reliable and comes with free storage for your previous alert views on line. 
My hate is the constant bugs the camera has. Fortunately, this is company that strives on perfection for its products. Wyze always responds to problems or glitches not like other company‚Äôs. I have had many problems but all have been fixed or resolved by Wyze customer service and IT services. Thank you"	positive
2286	1288415553	lifestyle	4	I really like the quality of the video even at night, the ability to set a detection area, the live feed, the fire alarm detection definitely puts me at ease and now they even have a face detection which i have yet to try. However, I have issues with the length of recordings as it only records for 12 seconds and won‚Äôt record again until after 5 mins after the last recording. I find that pretty much all activity is cut off at a very disadvantageous moment.  I‚Äôd really like to see more without having it on continuous recording. Otherwise a great camera and with the memory card you do have the option to continually record then go back and shuffle through to find anything specific.	positive
2287	1288415553	lifestyle	1	Bought this to watch our pet and pet sitter while we travelled. Worked beautifully at first for slightly over a week, but as soon as we travelled overseas, the camera disconnects permanently and an error message asking for the camera to be power cycled (rebooted) keeps recurring, rendering the product completely useless when you most need it. Apparently this is a common error amongst many users too! How are customers expected to do a reboot of your camera remotely? Sent in a help request via the Wyze official website and was informed via an automated reply that we would receive a reply within two business days. It has been FOUR business days and still no reply, while my family is worried sick about our pet alone at home. Restarting the useless app now every other hour since our first disconnect has proven useless. Definitely returning this useless item. I guess you get what you pay for!	negative
2288	1288415553	lifestyle	4	"So easy to setup and the app is good with lots of config options but I have suggestions for improvements. For the playback of stored videos please add fast-forward and rewind buttons, and skip forward/reverse 15 seconds buttons. Look at the Overdrive app for audio books for ideas on control buttons. 

For anyone buying the camera, spend $5 more to buy a 32GB mini SD card so you can playback recordings. The magnetic mount is great. I put the included double sided sticky tape circle on a window pane and stuck the metal disk to it. I mounted it on the inside so I turned off the infrared as it does not work through glass. I have a well lit porch and yard anyway. 

There is no monthly charge for the app to access the short notification videos from the motion detector, unlike most of the higher priced cameras. 

I will be buying more. Luckily I have a Microcenter store nearby that has plenty in stock for $25 and the $5 miniSD card. The power cord, although longer than an iPhone, could be longer still by 2-4 feet. I know, it adds to production costs. But it is a standard USB cord so longer replacement cords are everywhere and cheap."	positive
2289	1288415553	lifestyle	3	"On the whole an interesting device with much potential, but exhibits issues with both the app and camera itself.   

iPad support?    App needs a ""landscape"" perspective.

Notifications are spotty.   Of the iOS devices with the app installed only an old iPhone is properly posting notifications as banners.    The apps on iPad Airs, similarly configured to post notifications, receive notifications, where they can be reviewed within the app but do not post banners.  

Installing SD chips can be troublesome.   Not all SDs work, which Wyze does provide some guidance, but even ones you might have previously used in other applications and (re)formatted as FAT32 with desktop disk utilities will fail recognition by the camera.  Wyze says it has tests many SD chips, and their failure to provide a ‚Äúcertified‚Äù list seems a major oversight.  

Cameras fail to provide a proper device name when registering itself to the Wi-Fi network.   Consequently, ‚Äúunknown‚Äù and (should you have more than one) indistinguishable devices will be in your network.   Heads up for the security conscious.

Expect to spend serious amounts of time resolving issues that should have been caught in development and product rollout."	negative
2290	1288415553	lifestyle	3	I would love to see better playback functionality.  Finding previous recordings is a little challenging.  The current feature of using the back arrow and manually sliding the timeline often doesn‚Äôt show a recording.  After going back to previous recordings, then using the right (forward) arrow  skips to the current date/time.  It would be nice if it went to the very next recording.  So one has to rinse / repeat to get back to where you are wanting to go.  Also it would be nice to have a playback speed setting to watch the recordings faster.  A 2x or 4x would even be nice. Watching recordings real time becomes cumbersome.  That aside the app works as advertised and have had no issues with the cameras or viewing them through the app.	positive
2291	1288415553	lifestyle	2	Since the last update, my wife‚Äôs phone has not been allowed to log into the Wyze app. I had to create an account for her and then share my cameras to her account. It sends notifications to her phone constantly even if she has notifications turned off within the app. She‚Äôs an inch away from deleting the app because it doesn‚Äôt work the way it did just last week... There are 2 of us that should be able to access the same account simultaneously or at different times because there are two of us that live here and use the app and cameras. There is no reason that one should be forced to create ANOTHER account with no cameras of its own and then still get notification on top of notification even though they‚Äôre turned off in the app. Fix this. Add more motion detection zones too please.	positive
2292	1288415553	lifestyle	5	Just received my 3rd camera.  why? Because the picture quality and response time is impressive. Also, the price is incredible.  I hope it stays at this cost so everyone can afford a security camera.  I‚Äôve been shopping around for a long time, but didn‚Äôt purchase due to the cost.  I have one at my elderly Mother‚Äôs home and now I can check on her at night by just bringing up the app on my cell phone or tablet.  Setup was easy. I still need 1 more and will order soon. I‚Äôm telling all my family about the wyze and they are ordering.  By any chance will you be developing one for outside use? Weatherproof? If so, please notify your registered customers! Thanks!	positive
2293	1288415553	lifestyle	4	This app/camera is very good.  There is a few features I really hope they add though. The first being the ability to set specific days and times to record/notify of detection.  We have one by our back door, so we don‚Äôt want to be recorded every time we go in and out.  It‚Äôd be great to be able to set this to monitor while we are at work and asleep, but not during times we are home and moving around.  So far you can set one block of time to record, but it‚Äôs only for one block of time and for every day (no way to change settings for weekends).  Secondly it would be nice to be able to disable the microphone somehow.  You can choose not to record sound though so I guess it‚Äôs not a huge deal.	positive
2294	1288415553	lifestyle	1	"I love my Wyze cams. They are inexpensive and work well. The app has recently become a nightmare. After moving, I had to setup my cameras again since my internet information changed. I set up one camera and it was a huge hassle. You cannot select your WiFi network from a list, you have to type in the name of the network. It took a while to get everything connected and I never connected my other cameras. 

Well, tonight I tried to set up a second camera and it‚Äôs impossible. Not only have the numerous app updates not made it where you can select a WiFi network from a list, now you cannot fully type in the WiFi password without the app completely clearing it out. I could type out 4-5 characters before the app cleared the field. I hope this is fixed soon. I was considering buying other Wyze products but for now I will not."	positive
2295	1288415553	lifestyle	2	"I just bought the Wyze Cam V2 for about $28 after tax at at Home Depot. What caught my attention was the advertised 1080p High Quality Video and everything else. The quality is not 1080 in my opinion. It is at most 720p quality. What they don‚Äôt say is that, on motion detect notifications, you only get 12 second clip and have to pay a monthly fee for a longer clip. 

I also already own a CCTV Surveillance system and wanted to link this cam with my other universal app that monitors everything else and was not able to connect and unify them. (dont know if it is because my other app asks for a S/N before mac add. and the Wyze Cam only shows mac Address ) I don‚Äôt want or need multiple apps. And I feel this was Overhyped. It is worth the price and nothing more, for ugly video with web cam ‚Äúblocky‚Äù looking recordings and snapshots."	positive
2296	1288415553	lifestyle	5	"Absolutely love this webcam for the cost it‚Äôs insane. The mounting features are easy and strong. The cam is well built, and has a higher end feel.

 My one gripe about this whole thing is software on the app, I would love to see a feature to set timed notification windows. I‚Äôm getting annoyed with getting constant notifications of movement when I‚Äôm the one setting it off. It‚Äôs a bit annoying going into the app every time I get home to turn off notifications, just to turn them on when I go to bed or leave the house. 

All in all I love it and will definitely be picking up a couple more, as well as the sensor kit."	positive
2297	1288415553	lifestyle	3	I feel like this app is bare bones compared to other monitoring camera apps. The shortcuts don‚Äôt seem to work - like turning motion tracking off. Automation doesn‚Äôt work, the features never flip on at a certain time I set. Events/clips are great, but if I want to see the whole recording, there‚Äôs no shortcut link to the playback. I have to make note of the time stamp, back out of events, tap on the camera itself, tap on playback, the scroll though hours of footage till I get to the desired time. You can‚Äôt fine tune the timeline to get the desired minute - even on landscape mode. I hope they address these issues soon, because I really like the camera.  Wouldn‚Äôt want to sell it just because the app is not up to par.	positive
2298	1288415553	lifestyle	2	I'd love to give the cams and app a higher rating as the setup and picture quality/lack of lag is amazing. My gripe is with the alert scheduling. It's just too limited. It's literally just a time window. A. Single. Time. Block. For all types of alerts. Makes no sense. I'd like to have smoke and CO2 on 24/7. Makes sense, right? Well that's easy enough. But what if I want the cam to detect motion? Hmm, looks like it has to be 24/7. Well this is silly bc I'm home in the evenings and a couple days a week during the day and on weekends. Not being able to get that granular is a huge bummer. Each type of alert should have its own SCHEDULE! Doesn't seem too hard. Wyze wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel. Just do it like someone else. Nest has a decent paradigm for scheduling when my heat comes on and goes off. Do something like that.	positive
2299	1288415553	lifestyle	2	"I have 3 Cameras. When I open the app, the list slides down to make room for the loading indicator on top. The list slides AGAIN when the loading is complete. This loading indicator should be in a place where the whole list doesn‚Äôt bounce around. It makes your desired camera a moving target and you‚Äôll tap the wrong one. 

When I need to go back to the list of cameras, the < button on the top left is so small that it‚Äôs almost impossible to hit. It‚Äôs even harder in landscape mode. 

In landscape mode, the list still populated in vertical orientation (so it‚Äôs sideways).  If you use your iPhone or iPad turned on its right side, the video in full screen will be upside down. You have to turn your device straight up and then rotate right again to get the right orientation."	positive
2300	464988855	lifestyle	5	"All of my Nest products have been outstanding except for troubles I experienced with two out of three outdoor cameras that I purchased. 
  My first outdoor camera started going offline almost immediately after installation. I installed it in Florida and went back up north for the summer. It would not perform and went offline leaving me with a worthless camera for six months. Back home up north, I purchased two more outdoor cameras, the first one I installed performed as expected and gave me no problems. The second one started going offline almost immediately. At first, I thought that it was too far away from the modem. I installed an extender that didn‚Äôt help, so I tried a different one but the camera still wouldn‚Äôt stay online. I must have installed and reinstalled that camera ten times.   After a couple of months of frustration and many calls to Nest, the representative offered to send me a replacement camera. Guess what, upon receiving it, I installed it and the replacement camera worked perfectly!
  As soon as I returned to my Florida home, I called and suggested that Nest send me a replacement camera and they did. I installed it and it also worked perfectly right away. I have a suspicion that there may be a problem that Nest needs to address with their outdoor cameras given my experience with them. Thank you Nest for sending me those replacement cameras."	positive
2301	464988855	lifestyle	5	I have four air conditioning units in my house and started with one Nest.  That Nest was placed in the common area of kitchen, living and dining rooms.  I installed it myself which I thought easy but I do everything myself so it may be more challenging if you‚Äôre not handy.  The instructions are clear and specific which makes for a lot of steps but the good side of that is that if you take your time and follow you will not find it hard.  We now have four Nests. As for how the Nest works? Flawless, simple and wonderful.  The App is great and easy to use while the Nest itself does adjust as it learns your temperature habits.  I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs so I‚Äôm still old school and like to walk up to the thermostat and adjust it manually and Nest keeps all the features you‚Äôre used to on the actual Nest that‚Äôs on the wall.  It‚Äôs truly the best between modern convenience and Old school.  Oh, let me add that my wife is home all day and when she goes out she doesn‚Äôt lower our four Nests but Nest allows you to connect a persons cell phone to it so now when my wife leaves the house all four Nests switch to ‚ÄúAway‚Äù saving power.  Then as soon as she pulls into the driveway all the thermostats go back to normal to make the house adjust to her comfort levels.  I can‚Äôt give you one reason not to buy one.	positive

The better the internet connection the faster the cameras are but that goes for most everything on internet now days just wanted to throw that out there for some that are beginners checking out reviews. Anyways AAA+++++  I‚Äôm Very Happy with Nest Cameras IQ  version Are ones we used others may be ok to but I only used IQ‚Äôs so I can‚Äôt say anything on other versions as of yet and yes I would purchase Nest IQ outdoor Cameras again For Sure.  Goodluck in your camera adventure and hope this helps.. Happy New Year.!!! Go Trump 2020. !!!!!!	positive
2303	464988855	lifestyle	4	"I‚Äôve had Honeywell internet-compatible thermostats in my house for nearly six years, and they just stopped communicating with the internet after multiple calls with service.  Luckily I got them at Costco!  Costco returned them with no issues, and they also happened to have Nest thermostats available too.  So I got a full refund for the old thermostats, and bought two new Nest Version 3 thermostats (as my house is divided into two areas).  Replacing the first thermostat took a little longer than the second, as it was just getting to know how the unit works and confirming the wire schematic.  The first unit connected to my router with no problems, but the second one kept failing at first.  I ended up temporarily moving the second unit to the first unit‚Äôs location and got it to connect.  After I moved it back to its correct location, it was still connecting ok.  

The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars was that the actual application kept disconnecting after both thermostats were connected, and several times during installation.  It‚Äôs almost like it reset, and you‚Äôd have to start the install from the beginning again with the Nest app."	negative
2304	464988855	lifestyle	4	The app itself works well.  There are periods of time through the year where I would just like to run the fan on my furnace without being in heating or cooling mode.  The nest thermostat can run the fan by itself, but when doing so it must be in heating or cooling mode.  In spring, I like to circulate cool air from the basement through the house.  I also like to leave windows open for fresh air, and circulate that air too.  There are days where it‚Äôs 80* during the day and 50* at night.  These are perfect days to leave windows open and periodically run the fan.  However, for this to work with the nest, I have to set the cooling mode on and use a cooling set point above 80* to make sure the air conditioning isn‚Äôt coming on wastefully while windows are open.  It‚Äôs not the end of the world, but an item that I believe should be simple functionality that would bring me to like the product better.  If it worked as I would like it to, I could check in on the temperature with the app and run the fan during the day, without having to mess around and closely monitor temperatures.	positive
2305	464988855	lifestyle	5	"i have had my nest cameras for about a year & a half and i would recommend them to anyone! the quality of both the video & audio is still amazing to me. 
i bought the cameras after having a recurring issue with a neighbor & their teenagers. it was not long before the cameras put an end to the ongoing issue. the teens were in rare form one day, yelling obsenities & making crude gestures. then they called their mom & said i was harrassing them. when she got home i walked across the street with my cell phone. both cameras caught the entire episode. at one point the teens were out of view of the cameras, but the AUDIO was still captured of them threatening to destroy my cameras.
i have not had an issue since then. the cameras were a lifesaver!
on another occasion, my mailbox had been hit, so i just scrolled back through the video & there it was. a landscaping truck had taken it out. i simply called the company, forwarded the video & they replaced my mailbox.
i am a single woman, so the cameras give me peace of mind. they have paid for themselves many times over!"	positive
2306	464988855	lifestyle	1	We use our nest cameras as baby monitors. We like the capability to check them anywhere with WiFi and knew there would be trade offs given that these weren‚Äôt designed to be baby monitors. They‚Äôve always been a bit spotty and the nest service has been down in the middle of the night at less than ideal times. However, now that they‚Äôve forced users to merge a google account with nest account, we have had nothing but problems. We leave the app up all night to monitor our kiddos and it hasn‚Äôt stayed active without crashing in WEEKS. I have to wake up multiple times each night to re open the app and check on our kids. This is absolutely unacceptable especially given that they‚Äôre designed to be security cameras. I expected the service to improve from our previous issues with the integration with google accounts but it has been nothing but downhill from there. I am seriously considering a different product because the app experience is so poor. Get it together google. You‚Äôre supposed to set the gold standard for app experiences. If you‚Äôre a user reading this it‚Äôs probably too late and you‚Äôve already bought the equipment to go with the app but if I‚Äôve caught you early enough, steer clear.	positive
2307	464988855	lifestyle	1	"I‚Äôm a new user of the Nest Thermostats and like the equipment so far. My issues is with their remote services, in particular, their requirement to migrate my account to my gmail so I can use their smart services. In order to do that, Nest wants to have access to my google home names and the names and emails of my google home members. Why do they need this information? When I asked this question of Nest support, the employee didn‚Äôt have an answer. I refused to allow Nest access to my private and personal information and, in return, Nest denied me access to their smart services. In a nutshell, I now have a very expensive manual thermostat with no accessible smart features! I cannot use my thermostats remotely, and the sensors are completely useless because I can‚Äôt access them unless I migrate my account to google sign-in. 

There is one workaround: create a bogus gmail account and use that only for Nest app. So I did that, because let‚Äôs face it, I got a smart thermostat so I didn‚Äôt have to get out of bed at 3 am to adjust the thermostat! Worked fine for a day but now my account is offline and the Nest solution is to restart my router and disrupt all the other services and devices on my router so Nest can find my wifi signal again!"	positive
2308	464988855	lifestyle	5	"First it does what it‚Äôs supposed to do. Also tec support is good. 
       But one of the main reasons I like it is that you can lock the thermostat so that tenants can only raise it to a threshold you program in. For heat I program it at 70 but they can raise it to 72. After a couple of hours it goes back to 70. Also because I have 1 thermostat for 4 apartments I can monitor the other tenants actual room temperature with the remote sensors. 
     I enjoy peaking on my phone to see if everything is working properly. Once I figured out that the apartment with the thermostat was running a space heater. I realized this by looking at the thermostats temperature and seeing the other apartments where colder. 
    Also I once realized before anyone called me that the boiler had a issue. A pipe had developed a leak and would run a few minutes and turn off. It saved me from a lot of water damage. It would be great if the nest realized something was wrong. But if you keep a eye on it, it can give you a lot of information."	positive
2309	464988855	lifestyle	1	We have had Nest products for years (cameras, thermostats, and smoke detectors) and although we were really happy with them at first, they have just been getting worse and worse over the years. Connectivity issues on the devices themselves (both newer and older devices) and connectivity/playback issues in the app no matter what router/cell coverage and internet speeds we have. Often the skip forward/back 15 seconds takes longer than 15 seconds to even load, so often it is useless to try to skip forward. No real useful updates or improvements made to the app in who knows how long (how about a pause playback button or better clip making features both of which are available just through web browsers?!). I know Google has been known to drive products/services they purchase into the ground but was hoping maybe Nest would be the exception since they seemed to be pretty hands-off for a long time. Seeing as how Nest has been on the decline for a while now though, recently rebranded as ‚ÄúGoogle Nest‚Äù, and Google has all but forced Nest logins to merge with Google logins, I suppose we are in the market for other products at this point...	positive
2310	464988855	lifestyle	5	I‚Äôve had this Nest thermostat just over 6 years & it is by far the best thermostat I‚Äôve ever had! First of all it‚Äôs extremely reliable! However the best part is the savings & comfort that comes with it! The temperature goes to whatever ‚Äúaway temp‚Äù on its own automatically when everyone leaves our home & then goes back to my normal setting when you walk in the door. I can also go to the Nest app on my way home & set the temp of my choice if I want to! It also learns the temps we like at certain times throughout the day if I want it to do so. I also think it‚Äôs cool that the thermostat screen is blank until I walk up to it & then it comes to life. I‚Äôve recommended this thermostat to many people & absolutely everyone that has took my advice & bought it loves it just as much as I do! I have the first generation so I can only imagine that it has gotten better which is hard for me to believe. All I can say is buy one! I promise that you will love it too!	positive
2311	464988855	lifestyle	5	"Pros:
-well built.  
-easy to install
-built in lithium ion battery backup
-Geofencing.
-runs fan after the heat turns off for a couple minutes to get the rest of the heat out of the ductwork instead of heating the walls.
-seems to connect well on both 2.4 and 5 G networks.
- the app does well at showing the thermostat wire connections.

Cons
-does not work with Apple home kit which would put the Thermostat control right in the control center of the iPhone.   I am hoping they add this in a future update!
-no geofencing range limit that can be set.  Not sure what range it is using.  It would be great to at least know.
-requires all home members who want to use geofencing (home/away) feature to have separate google accounts. 
-does seem to always recognize when I come home and doesn‚Äôt switch from Away to Home mode.
-cannot set the cycle rate so the temps fluctuate way to much.  I am guessing the different is about 2 or 3 degrees.  This maintenance band is too wide.
-both on the app and the thermostat it‚Äôs hard to know what temperatures you are looking at, is it the actual temperature or set point.  Especially around the dial, it just uses points and does not list out the actual temperature.  Very annoying.  I don‚Äôt want to have to add up 1/2 degree tick marks.  Include some numbers already.
-lithium ion battery is probably not replaceable.

Was a tough choice between this and the Emerson Sensi.  Just hoping for some good updates now that google owns it."	positive
2312	464988855	lifestyle	3	The app is okay overall, but I find it lacking in simple customization. For some reason, they haven‚Äôt provided the option to customize the sound for push notifications within this app. There‚Äôs no way to set it at the iOS setting level, this must be done within the app, but the Nest app hasn‚Äôt added support for that. I contacted their in app support chat to make sure I hadn‚Äôt missed it somewhere and they confirmed they don‚Äôt support it. I asked if it‚Äôs something they will consider adding in the future, and to be honest I couldn‚Äôt really get that answer from the support agent. I had to repeat the question in a few ways asking if they could get that request to the right team. It would be better if support agents could talk to developers so that they could know what people are asking for. I use notification sounds for all my important apps so that I can differentiate without looking at my phone; a specific sound tells me which app the notification is from. This app only supports the default iOS notification sound.	positive

If I send a home invite from husband‚Äôs phone to wife‚Äôs phone and accept, the wife‚Äôs phone won‚Äôt have access to the doorbell and only the home hub. Sometimes it‚Äôs neither, but mostly just not the doorbell. I make sure that the couple are using gmail accounts. Google assistant is also installed.

My nest stopped working, just one of those things right as temps started to get hot. I called their tech support and all I can say is WOW!!  They‚Äôre so worth every penny and more I spent on that nest. The tech Noelia stayed on the phone with me until she got my AC working temporarily and she is rushing me out a new unit.  It was easy to get my AC working again and she walked me through it step by step and waiting on the line to make sure we had air.

2316	464988855	lifestyle	1	When I first purchased the indoor cameras, motion detectors, nest aware etc everything worked great. That lasted a few months. Not sure if this is an issue with the app unable to communicate with the hardware or the hardware not communicating with the app. Now I get reminders to set alarm when we are home, constantly. Apparently it no longer recognizes when we‚Äôre home and when we are not. The indoor cameras turn on and off at will when we are home and I get constant notifications that ‚Äúlooks like someone is home‚Äù constantly. Yes that‚Äôs me who‚Äôs home thanks for letting me know every 5 minutes. Facial recognition you ask??? Pretty much useless since it doesn‚Äôt recognize me or any of my family members even though we have had the cameras for over a year. App CONSTANTLY sends me push notifications when we‚Äôre home. Apparently the only thing it recognizes and remembers are packages left at the front door. For such expensive hardware I‚Äôd expect it to work like its price tag would indicate. Unfortunately I‚Äôm ‚Äústuck‚Äù with all the nest hardware and therefore the app. I‚Äôd recommend going with something else that has better value for your money.	positive
2317	464988855	lifestyle	5	"You never know how valuable something is (or if it even works!) until you *have* to. For us, that experience was with our Nest Fire and CO2 detector. When we needed to replace old detectors, I chose to pay a little more for Nest. Would it pay off; would it be worth it? We figured probably not, but we installed them anyway. 

This holiday season, we were 900 miles away - certainly not thinking of home. At church, I went to silence my phone & noticed a Nest alert that there was smoke detected in our home. Surprisingly calm, I called our local fire dispatch & contacted neighbors and family. By the time the fire department arrived, smoke filled our home. The cause: an overheated furnace! 

Our home was likely saved because of that Nest alert. We can deal with minor smoke damage! That decision to buy a Nest product made all the difference in the world. It worked exactly as expected, when needed most, and we are forever grateful."	positive
2318	464988855	lifestyle	2	I‚Äôve had 2 nest outdoor cameras at my home for several years and my experience can be summed up in the title of the review. The lag/buffering is atrocious. I‚Äôve tested the WiFi signal strength from each camera‚Äôs location and get full signal from both spots. Also worth mentioning I have gigabit internet along with a top of the line modem & the Rolls Royce of routers from Netgear and everything else in the house runs flawlessly. It‚Äôs extremely frustrating when you hear a strange noise during the night and open the app to check your cameras only to be greeted by a never ending spinning blue circle. Don‚Äôt bother calling customer service, they will inevitably tell you that you have subpar connection or slow internet speeds. The only saving grace is that the nest cam IQ outdoor I have at my lake house has worked pretty much without issue since I installed it about 5 months ago. Only wish I could say the same for the other 2 at my house. Would not recommend these cameras to anyone. When you need to know what is going on outside of your home in a moments notice, Nest will let you down.	positive
2319	464988855	lifestyle	1	"As far as the app goes, it keeps getting disconnected (sometimes 4 times in 5 seconds) from the nest and sometimes what you set in the app is not actually set in the nest or it does not reflect the nest state if you go to the actual device, you will see. This has been very annoying and frustrating since I paid so much for a darn thermostat just to be able to control it remotely and for a bit of smarts.

Now for the actual Nest thermostat itself. The device looks pretty, but smart would not be amongst the words I would use to describe it. Once it latches on to a setting (‚Äúlearns it‚Äù) it is almost impossible to change the setting. If it wants to set the temp to 70, and you feel like you want to change it, it will change it back. You can‚Äôt turn off the smarts completely. You have to reset it completely to get rid of what it has learned, but then it will learn again and you will be in the same place. There are multitude of other very annoying and frustrating flaws with this thing which would take much more to explain. Don‚Äôt wast your time or money on this over priced thing. I wish I hadn‚Äôt."	positive

The smoke are great if you have a dog,a voice gives you a warning that it detects smoke and that the alarm will sound and the alarm is loud. That gives you time to cancel the alarm before it sounds. My dogs don‚Äôt stress out for a false alarm anymore. The night light option is fantastic. They light the way for me downstairs so I don‚Äôt have to put the bright lights on and possibly wake the house when I leave early in the AM. The door lock is great because my son doesn‚Äôt need to worry about losing or forgetting his door key. He just types his number and he‚Äôs in.  Then the thermostat which was the first Nest product I bought is the best of the lot. It learns our schedule and then it automatically adjusts the temperature accordingly. Plus a few nice options like displaying the time or temperature etc. all in all these are fantastic products. I highly recommend them.	positive

permission for the sharing of data between Nest and Google.,. And since my Google account password is long and complex, and I don‚Äôt have it memorized, It turns the simple task of making a change to my thermostat (E.G.putting it in Eco mode as I‚Äôm leaving the house) into an annoying and inconvenient waste of 7-8 minutes of my time... this will inevitably happen at the most inconvenient of times (e.g. as I am in a rush for an appointment)‚Ä¶ Nest second-level support tells me that this is what the normal behavior of the Nest app after migrating over to the Google account, and that there is no workaround‚Ä¶They do not seem to understand how annoying this new app behavior is‚Ä¶ I am ready to rip out my nest thermostat and nest cams and now will definitely  NOT be purchasing a Nest/Google security system as I had planned‚Ä¶"	positive
2322	464988855	lifestyle	4	"ThIS REVIEW IS FOR THE APP

But seeing how you can't separate the device from the app, there is some crossover.

It was ""the first"" and it's been a consistent performer. I haven't looked into the EcoBee enough to know if it can perform a few things better but here goes.

The good is that it does learn and does keep track fairly well of what we like. But I feel the bad are so easy to change I just don't know why Google doesn't.

I have a two story house, the front faces directly east towards sunshine. The Nest is in the shade on an upstairs wall and I have a Nest temperature sensor downstairs. Like most houses, my upstairs becomes a furnace while my downstairs is a freezer.

The first problem is that for scheduling which sensor I want the app to use, the times are not adjustable. Meaning for most of the day I want the downstairs sensor to keep the downstairs more comfortable as that's where we spend our time but we put the kids to bed upstairs at 8pm and the app won't let me switch to use the upstairs sensor until 9pm. Why does scheduling have to be in blocks that Nest forces?

The second problem is that setting the sensor to Away or back to Home when we leave for vacation never stays set. Twice now I've set the thermostat to turn back on because we are headed home only to realize the app changed back to Away once I closed it.

I have Outdoor and indoor cameras for both, a few Nest thermostats, Nest X Yale deadbolt and i also used to have the Ring video doorbell and got rid of it as the app was slow to open when an event was triggered and had laggy video. To counter that I got a new Nest Doorbell and replaced the Ring video doorbell. As you can see I am quite heavily invested in the Nest ecosystem.

The Nest app is now the painfully slow app and it seems Ring updated their app and it is now quick and highly responsive... So much so that when deciding which company to use for home security I went with Ring because the app is just that much quicker to react. In its current state I do not recommend this app and thus unfortunately can not recommend Nest products because this is a security issue and the faster the response the sooner you can deal with any issues/threats/what-not.

Maybe Nest should have two apps one for Thermostats and other smart devices and those that focus on Video and home-security another quicker app."	positive

On the other house it was oil boiler two wires. I was not positive of a few wires so called Support. Spoke with Ed and he had me send a picture of the current thermostat with wires to confirm what I was thinking. He actually stayed on the phone with me the entire time from Removal of old thermostat to installation of the Nest and the to change the programming so it was on the new home. He was very helpful, friendly, professional and externally patient!!! Total time was maybe 45 - 50 minutes but he stayed on to make sure it was installed and connected to my WiFi and working! AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS!!! I can not appreciate how much he took his time since this was recorded as a new install because it moved from one hour to another. 10/7 stars!!!	positive

Randomly deletes at least 1 of two of my properties so I must reinstall the app periodically missing critical video footage. Each time I call tech support the person on the phone struggles to dirai English and is absolutely CLUELESS what they are doing. The guy must have said ‚ÄúUM‚Äù at least 100 times. All that‚Äôs needed is to delete the app and reboot your phone but they never tell you this. They blame it on the bandwidth of the internet. I told him this is impossible because I have 2 different properties in 2 different states using 2 different cable companies and both are showing slow motion clips or clips that stop a second after they play. I troubleshooted MYSELF by simply deleting and reinstalling the app and rebooting my phone. Dont waste your time calling them for help. No one knows what they are doing and the app doesn‚Äôt have an FAQ‚Äôs that suggests doing what I did as a FIRST measure for resolve the issue. Stupid.	negative

Gave up because he could not figure out how to solve the problem.

2327	464988855	lifestyle	4	"I have two buildings each with their own Nest thermostat, so it is great to control them both from a single app. The home/away feature I fairly reliable at one place, but at my townhouse it seems to struggle with whether or not I‚Äôm home. I found that I had applied a setting so that the app would only get my location data when it was open, so it often wouldn‚Äôt know where I was. It‚Äôs still a trade off for me to decide between the home away feature and the implications of yet another service that is continually tracking where I am. It would be nice if it could detect my presence in the building through WiFi (proximity to the thermostat) rather than continually tracking where I am. 

The app is easy to use and mostly intuitive. The only improvement I‚Äôd like to see is to make it easier to work with two thermostats. It‚Äôs a little clunky the way you currently have to switch between them."	positive
2328	464988855	lifestyle	5	"This camera has been a life saver, literally but before we get to here are the important bullet points: 
- The setup took a few minutes and was straight forward, super simple 
- The quality of the camera is great, auto nighttime mode works seamlessly
- Unlike other cameras and services the Nest works 100% of the time. The monitoring site has never been done and I‚Äôve never had any issues with the camera in the year I‚Äôve owned it. I have a lot of friends that brag a out their cost savings but to only have issues. 

I specifically purchased the camera to check in on my senior bulldog. While on a trip across the country she passed out while her pet sitter was feeding her. She immediately stood up finished eating and went for a walk, making the pet sitter feel comfortable enough to leave her but worried enough to call me. I immediately reviewed the camera and it was clear to me it was a heart arrhythmia episode, panicked I called a friend and asked her to rush my bulldog to the emergency vet. With the help of her cardiologist she pulled through, BUT if I wasn‚Äôt able to easily review the camera while driving in a car in the middle of the dessert she would have passed away that night at home alone. 

So it‚Äôs not just the camera it‚Äôs the whole package, the quality and consistency."	positive
2329	464988855	lifestyle	1	"When u have two thermostats , ie one upstairs and one downstairs you should be able to see temperature for both at the same time. This app makes you click too left corner to then click again to choose which thermostat to view to see temp and then click to adjust. The circles (both) that show thermostats should ALWAYS appear on screen when you log into app so you can quickly see temp and change if desired. Also when looking at schedule it would be nice to have the time stamps fonts bigger. Hard to see small type especially at night.
 I think they are also missing a common thermostat function called ‚Äòhold‚Äô where you can set and keep at that temp until changed. With Nest it will change to next temp on schedule. I don‚Äôt see HOlLD‚Äî unless I‚Äôm missing it?? Easy stuff for Nest to fix. Hope they do. I like the thermostat. App should be great, not just ok.
‚Äî-Still hasn‚Äôt had a good app or product update in two years. Also schedule settings are small to see timeline. Also that mode crashes often. Fix it already will ya."	positive
2330	464988855	lifestyle	1	"I have had several problems with these cameras and the Customer Service is just not there. They want you to stay on the phone or chat with them for HOURS with the problem not getting fixed in the end on some things. Other things have been fixed by ‚Äúsimply‚Äù deleting, reinstalling and setting everything back up the way it was and it gets fixed. ***WAIT*** So if you set everything up the way it was before and it works now but not then it does not makes sense that it is now fixed. Obviously the problem was too deep for the technical team to find so it is the Microsoft approach to reinstall and start from scratch. 

Then if you have a camera but do not subscribe to their service when you go to view that camera, most of the time there is the spinning circle in the middle forever and never recovers. You have to go into the settings for that camera, turn it off them back on and WA LA!! It will now allow you to see what you want. 

Oh yeah, connection time is horrible. I get a notification that there is motion in my garage, I open the app and wait for the spinning circle to go away then click on the garage and by the time I can see what happens the person spotted in the garage is standing in front of me. Gots to be better cams out there. 

**UPDATE**
If you provide a negative feedback then your ability to connect to any camera takes forever. Opened the app several times but could not connect so then just opened it and watched for over 5 minutes. Screw that!"	negative
2331	464988855	lifestyle	2	I have been looking for an alternative to the Nest thermostat. Nests are quirky and suffer from problems connecting to the app. My first Nest lasted about 8 months, stopped communicating with the app and had to be replaced. I called Nest and spent an hour troubleshooting only to have them instruct me to reset it to factory defaults which deleted all of my programming. They promised to overnight me a new thermostat. A whole week later I received a useless part. I called Nest and they wanted to ship me another Nest, but my yoga studio was suffering, so I negotiated a new thermostat that I would purchase and install (same night) with a refund from them. I provided them the receipt the next day and it took about 4 MONTHS and many calls to be reimbursed. The 2nd thermostat connects very slowly to the app and often drops off. The programming also randomly re-adjusts. One of my yoga teachers says the one in her home ‚Äúhas always been that way.‚Äù  I don‚Äôt recommend the thermostat. Maybe the security system is better. Who knows?	positive
2332	464988855	lifestyle	3	When nest sends you a pop up image and asks you to tag a face as familiar or unfamiliar and you tag ‚Äúunfamiliar‚Äù that face is lost forever.  They also give no warning that this loss will occur.  why would you mark an unfamiliar face as familiar?  Therefore if that unfamiliar person broke into your home, their image is lost and if the video is not great you have no image of your criminal.  I spent much time this holiday trying to explain this to Nest service chat and they had no clue this was an issue.  After a long chat that went no where i asked to escalate to a supervisor.   I had to explain the problem again and That person told me they would escalate the issue and let me know if there‚Äôs a solution but not alert me if there wasn‚Äôt.  Thoughtless!  Im glad i learned this difficult lesson about unfamiliar faces and Nests poor customer service when we did not have an actual break inso we can hope to avoid a future issue.	negative
2333	464988855	lifestyle	5	Nest system is great, overall. In love with keyless entry. I have the Nest learning thermostat - my old thermostat had only 2 wires. The R (power) and the W (heat). What I found is the R wire is NOT Enough to generate enough power to maintain a wifi connection and then my furnace shut down. And it seems like a problem a lot of people have with the Nest. I wish that this was something addressed in the installation of the Nest and I do think it should come with a charger for those who may not have a common wire to increase the power. Thankfully I did purchase new wiring with a third C wire (common) to boost the electrical input for power but it took too much research and during a time while I was researching I wasn‚Äôt able to have heat during a very cold month. Thankfully I was able to run the new wiring alone and not pay a furnace company an insane fee to do it for me.	positive
2334	464988855	lifestyle	1	"Over the past year, my Nest experience has become progressively worse. The camera used to be rock solid, almost always connected, and picked up pretty much all motion correctly. (Occasionally a person would be detected as generic motion and vice versa)

But a few months back my camera started having random outages unrelated to WiFi, happening a handful of times each week. This seems to have slowed down but is still an occasional thing. There‚Äôs no release notes for firmware updates in the app or online, and they happen silently. This means I can‚Äôt check to see if a recent update may be causing issues.

The worst issue is that currently very obvious motion events intermittently aren‚Äôt even recorded on the timeline at all. A person leaving the front door, the entire car leaving the driveway, people walking up to the front door. I cannot trust the camera anymore, the one thing that sold me on Nest in the first place. Multiple people have reported this same exact issue on the forums for months with no resolution."	negative
2335	464988855	lifestyle	3	"Before Google got involved with Nest it seems my Nest cameras and thermostat connect with my iPhone very well. The internet signal always tests ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù, but most of the time I use the Nest app to check the thermostat all I get is searching and a notice to try later or that my internet is not strong enough to upload the data. The Thermostat is approximately 15 feet from the internet ‚Äútower‚Äù. The interior camera is approx. 10 feet away. Exterior camera is approximately 40 feet away. I used to get excellent and fast response. Nothing has changed physically, but the connection is sporadic at best since Google has gotten involved.
I would really like to talk with someone about this. But I can‚Äôt find a phone # to call a Nest tech rep. All I can find are ‚Äúhelp‚Äù screens and they don‚Äôt solve the problem . I have a $1,000 invested in these cameras and a thermostat and most of the time they are useless.

2336	464988855	lifestyle	1	"For being the original smart home thermostat, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have a pretty polished product by now, but NOPE. I don‚Äôt have much issue with the thermostat itself, it‚Äôs about as straightforward as any non-smart thermostat, the problem is the unintuitive dumpster fire that is the app. 

To be fair, the main problem is the scheduling section, but since that is literally THE most important function of the app, I don‚Äôt feel too bad calling the whole thing a failure. 

The schedule section has no instructions, no tooltips, and is unintuitive. It has buttons that are apparently useless, or if they do do something, then they‚Äôre missing stuff. I‚Äôm talking about the ‚Äòcopy week‚Äô button. What weeks? There is no month view, there is no ‚Äònext week‚Äô or ‚Äòprevious week‚Äô button, there is no ‚Äòmake this the default‚Äô option. So when I go through and individually set every temperature (a process just begging for some sort of convenience feature), I am rewarded by having it completely garbled the following week when for some reason the app tries to merge my changes with what it thought that next week should be, resulting in 30 minute windows of the temperature I actually wanted. And of course there‚Äôs no option to turn off the schedule feature and just leave it at a set manual temperature. 

I bought this house with a Nest already in it, and I will be removing it in favor of a competitor that has some semblance of quality control in their interface design."	negative

Prior to becoming a Nest customer, I was hesitant to purchase their product because of the monthly subscription.  One year, I got a camera as a gift and tried their free trial.  I knew it was going to take more than the video quality to become a customer.  So, I tried it and once I tested the playback feature I was completely sold. I could not believe how easy it was to review 24 hours of data in less than a minute.  The cloud based Nest home surveillance system is the way to go.

2338	464988855	lifestyle	4	"Overall it works well. For some reason it loses Wi-Fi connection frequently even though I have a router very close to it. 

I just wish the quality of the familar faces images were better. I love the theory of familiar faces but the cameos of people to be identified are small, blurry, and too pixilated to be easily identified and named. I have to go back at the date and time taken history to tell who it is. The quality of the facial images could definitely be improved. Lacking that, the ability to enlarge the cameos a little would help a lot. My work-around for that is to take a screenshot, blow it up and then identify who it is. And when it notifies that it sees a familar person it sometimes identifies who it is by name and sometimes only says familar face. If it's a familar face why doesn't it say who it is everytime?

Good app, could just used tweaked."	positive

2340	464988855	lifestyle	2	I use my Nest indoor camera for security when I‚Äôm not home, and since I work nights in a big new city it‚Äôs important for it to be functioning when I‚Äôm gone. I‚Äôve had issues with the app since I got the camera in July, but after merging with Google it‚Äôs gotten so much worse. When I‚Äôm not home the camera is constantly offline, even when my phone is at 5 bars, and all other apps are working perfectly. Since the merge, whenever this happens the app also automatically logs me out entirely. This defeats the purpose of having a security camera, since it only seems to work when I‚Äôm in the immediate vicinity of my home‚Äôs WiFi. I had the camera on the other day and was never notified of someone from my apartment‚Äôs maintenance inside my home.

The Tech got his supervisor‚Äôs approval to send the replacement overnight. After 3 or 4 days I received an email indicating the thermostat was shipped. In their email they had mentioned that I will get another email with return label for the defective thermostat. I finally received the replacement yesterday. However there is no email in sight with the return label! The technician did a good job pinpointing the problem. The company did a lousy job fulfilling what they promised!

2343	464988855	lifestyle	2	"I‚Äôve had a Nest home cam for some time, and recently added a doorbell, an outdoor camera, and a thermostat.

The Home/Away Assist feature is frustratingly unreliable. There are two of us in the household, each of us using our own Google ID to log into Nest and set up Home/Away assist. Every few days, one of us gets randomly logged out of Nest, even though we keep the app always running. The Nest can‚Äôt figure out if anyone is home or not. I then have to go into the app to manually set the status or turn a camera on or off. Sometimes I have to drill down deep in the settings to determine if it‚Äôs logged in or not, even as the app cheerfully streams live video. I have to look for a little yellow exclamation mark and the message that ‚Äúwe haven‚Äôt heard from your phone in awhile.‚Äù (The phone has been literally running the app continuously!)

Then after logging in, Nest acts like we‚Äôve never logged in before, asks everything about using the Google ID and setting up Home/Away for the same user that was previously logged in.

Finally, you can‚Äôt change the tone used for notifications from the iPhone default, which is ridiculous.

I‚Äôm willing to bet that the Nest app will eventually disappear into the Google Home app. I prefer the Nest home screen, so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll take that away."	positive

Could animals trigger it (nest thinks someone home if animal movement)? But my animals are cats and not at height of nest thermostat so?
Major issue, when looking back at energy use, it shows some days that heat/nest was operating for over 12 hours when I wasn‚Äôt home. My energy use has gone up since installing nest!

Once it actually loads the footage plays for maybe 2-3 seconds tops before it shuts off midway through. It‚Äôs a constant annoyance to have to mess around with this. Please fix this issue. Another thing that is a bother is not having the option to shut the light off. That feature should not have been removed. You can literally put a piece of black duct tape over the tiny light and never notice the dang difference so when the feature was removed and there was commotion over it I thought how dumb.

I would like to control the nest temperature from my phone when elderly people are home or pets or bump it up occasionally for kids who cannot do Nest on their own.  My Nest keeps reverting back to Away mode because I am not home.  This is extremely frustrating as people are extremely cold at my house.   As soon as I get home the Nest recognizes my phone but when I pop back out to the store the stupid Nest thinks I am Away and turns down the heat and I come back to a really cold environment.  I am totally onboard with conserving energy while the house is empty but this system is not friendly to those extra family members who can‚Äôt control the Nest without a phone.  Changing the dial hardwired to the wall is frustrating because if I am out of the house with my phone the dial reverts back to Away mode for my elderly Parents.	negative
2349	464988855	lifestyle	1	My dog is consistently recognized as a human and sets off the notification that a person is in my home whenever he stretches out, which is several times a day, creating a chicken little effect.  Additionally, the ability to turn off the status light indicator was removed several months ago.  Now the cameras I have setup in windows reflect a bright blue light in the video that I record on outward facing cameras.  Additionally, it draws attention to the cameras which makes them easily spotted and allows for blind spots in the setup to be identified and alerts any would be thieves that they should take care to cover their faces when entering their field of view.  For my purposes the status light indicators not being able to be turned off, except in connection or troubleshooting issues, is counter productive.  Being able to override these settings manually is a choice that I as an end user would like to maintain.	positive
2350	1462195529	lifestyle	3	Obviously making money is awesome and being able to do it with surveys on your free time is a plus, but this app feels like it's tugging your chain a lot of the time. Surveys have an estimated completion time and an amount of point you get for completing it shown to you when it lists all the available surveys, but the time doesn't seem to account for the starting questionnaire to each survey that determines whether you qualify to take the survey. This is an issue because you can spend 10 minutes going through the questionnaire on a survey that is supposedly supposed to take 5 minutes long just to have you finish the starting questionnaire and have it tell you that you don't qualify and are compensated with a measly 3 points. On top of this, I've noticed several bugs. Some surveys take a million years to load the next question which only wastes more time, sometimes a survey gets stuck on a question or loading screen or something totally random can happen. Some of these surveys have bugs that don't allow you to properly answer the question, and it's usually things that seem like common sense to get right, other times the survey will say it's redirecting you only to fail or get stuck loading something, so now all you can do is close the app and not be compensated for anything you had previously done. It seems like the developers of this app are consistently making changes to the app, so hopefully these issues do get fixed.	positive

I expect that I won‚Äôt qualify for most surveys and will only receive pennies for trying, but to complete surveys and get nothing is way more then frustrating. 
Completed a survey with ‚Äúpoints pending‚Äù for 7 days; and 15 days later, still waiting on points. Completed a second one with pending points 5 days ago and another one for 60 points this morning, but am doubting I‚Äôll get paid for any of these since it seems the ‚Äúpending‚Äù ones never pay out. (Probably because the companies are hoping you‚Äôll forget about them.)
But I think the most frustrating thing of all is when you complete a survey that tells you you‚Äôve earned 60 points and you don‚Äôt get those points either. (This is what happened with the first survey I completed today.) So all in all, in order to accumulate some points, you spend hours ‚Äúattempting‚Äù surveys to collect 2-3 points at a time.

This is insane that I‚Äôm providing the service that I promised I would while receiving nothing I was promised, these surveys are generally long and boring affairs that take time out of my short life and I‚Äôm already only getting (generally at best) 40 cents for it and either the app or the companies I‚Äôm answering for are robbing me of that little bit! I‚Äôve done these kinds of things at store front survey places where you at least get interesting surveys about movie trailer opinions or get to sample new foods and generally get between $5-$10 for 30 mins but most surveys here offer 40 points for 25-30 mins of your time and it takes 1000 points before you can even cash in for the $10!

You don‚Äôt qualify for this survey!‚Äù Then it gives you one or two points as a consolation. They get a lot of answers out of you and then you don‚Äôt get paid. The other message you get is ‚Äúthis survey is full‚Äù after you‚Äôve answered most of the questions. This is crap. Why have the survey available if it‚Äôs FULL? That tells me one thing- SCAM. You take the surveys and give the survey provider most, of not all, the info they need, and then you get kicked out of the survey. I answer all my questions honestly, it‚Äôs got nothing to do with my profile. It also ripped me off for 30 points when I completed a survey and then it only gave me 3 points. 

They state that people qualify for an average of 1 out 5 surveys. That‚Äôs a lie. It‚Äôs more like 1-50. But you‚Äôll waste your time being disqualified for hours, while only receiving 10 points for four hours of your time. That‚Äôs 10 cents. Sweatshops don‚Äôt even pay that poorly. This app is an absolute scam."	negative

I couldn‚Äôt have asked for anything better, however, there is one problem that suddenly started happening... I use survey junkie on a tablet and the layout one day, began to be a bit glitchy. It seems zoomed in enough that I can‚Äôt read all the words on the screen, and parts of pages are clipped off. I tried redownloading and resetting the app but nothing worked...I hope this is something that can be fixed in the near future because I really love this app!!

Also, sometimes when I complete a server, it does not give me the earned credits, ( usually a server that does not give a hefty amount of points; 15, 10, etc) and also when I am not suitable for completing the server sometimes it does not give me the small 2 or 3 points. I know it‚Äôs a small amount of points, but at the end of the week it really adds up!!"	positive
2355	1462195529	lifestyle	1	I wish I had read the reviews before, my fault for not doing that. Everyone who says it lures you in at first and then basically steals your survey answers for 15-20 minutes and then suddenly disqualified you is absolutely right! I‚Äôve been disqualified from plenty of surveys after a handful of questions and never complained because that just is what it is. But when I wasted 20 minutes answering a long survey only to be told I didn‚Äôt disqualify and without offering me at least a couple of points for my time, I emailed support. They were condescending, trying to blame me for not completing my profile (my profile is totally complete) and giving the old ‚Äúwe‚Äôre sorry and can understand it‚Äôs frustrating but you can be disqualified at any point for any reason and we can‚Äôt help that‚Äù - completely missing the point that I was booted off the survey after answering 100% of the questions and without being paid anything. It wasn‚Äôt just a matter of not fitting the demographic after a handful of questions. I literally FINISHED ANSWERING EVERY QUESTION. It clearly happens all the time (after you‚Äôve earned a few dollars of course, so you‚Äôll keep coming back). So not worth it.	negative
2356	1462195529	lifestyle	5	I personally really like SurveyJunkie.  As a 17 year old with no part time looking for some way to make a little extra money, I personally really liked the app overall.  The money obviously does not come fast and yes there are a few problems with the way they do surveys and occasionally it won‚Äôt pay you.  But it is possible to make a lot of money from this overtime.  Last month a was able to cash out $40 dollars over the course of the month and I was mostly doing the surveys in my free time.  I think it is completely possible to make more if you are the type of person that likes to grind for that extra money but I usually aim for about $1.5 to $2 dollars a day.   It obviously is not a perfect survey app but it is probably the best your going to get if you really want to make money from completing surveys.  And personally, I do not think it gets better than this for a survey app.	positive
2357	1462195529	lifestyle	5	"I have a qualm with this app; you take a survey that says it is anywhere from 35 to 120 points and will require a certain amount of minutes to complete. Then about 10 to 15 mins into taking the survey it shuts down and says you didn‚Äôt qualify but we will give you 1 to 3 points for trying. Then you go to the next one and the next one and end up with the same. Basically marketing companies are receiving your opinions in these surveys for free while the app makes excuses for why you can‚Äôt obtain the points you should be able to for the time it took you to fill it all out. You may get one or at most two surveys a day where you actually accumulate the points the survey is supposed to be worth. Then it will take a half an hour.
They definitely have things built in place so you cannot accumulate points by being more ambitious."	positive
2358	1462195529	lifestyle	5	"I‚Äôm liking this app so far. It‚Äôs clean and organized and you can see how much money is redeemable very easily. Today I have tried multiple survey rewards apps (Survey Monkey, Zap Surveys, and a couple more. This one you can take surveys kind of within the app itself. If you‚Äôve tried Zap Surveys, you‚Äôll know what I mean. In Zap, there‚Äôs a menu with a place to click on different things like tap survey, value survey, etc but it brings you over to a different survey thing online (and doesn‚Äôt connect rewards to Zap).

Survey Junkie is organized in that you know how much rewards you have, you take the surveys in the app, you can connect it to paypal and redeem as soon as you have $5.00 (5 dollars), which is 500 points. The points aren‚Äôt super hard to get, like most other survey rewards apps."	positive
2359	1462195529	lifestyle	2	When I first got the app I was able to complete a few surveys and I wouldn‚Äôt qualify for a few, but that is to be expected. However, just a few days in and I am not able to qualify for any surveys for almost 3 days now of nonstop searching. What is even worse is that I will be half way through a survey once I finally qualified and it kicks me out in the middle of my survey saying its full even though I was already in it and it gives me just 2 points when I was 15 minutes into a survey. Additionally some surveys just take you around in a never ending circle jumping from site to site and never actually landing on a survey. They try to get you to sign up for more services similar but I don‚Äôt want to because this one is so bad. The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not one is that of they actually customized your survey list like they say they do to show you surveys that you qualify for it would be a great app. I am very disappointed and sad to be writing this.	negative
2360	1462195529	lifestyle	2	Okay so the app isn‚Äôt horrible but their was multiple time I spent 25 mins plus on a 25 cent survey just for it to have trouble redirecting or it freezes and boom no point for me. Then their are multiple times I‚Äôm spending 25 mins plus for a 40 cent survey and when I‚Äôm almost done it says I wasn‚Äôt qualified after I already spent a while on the survey because I didn‚Äôt choose the answers they were looking for ... how is this supposed to be about my opinion if I was the curve my answers towards what I think the survey might want to go choose. Also ik ‚Äúmoney is money‚Äù and all but a lot of us are spending literally house answering all of these questions just to receive 20-50 cents just think it would be cool if the payout was at least a a dollar a survey which it really nothing because let‚Äôs face it, you‚Äôre company in benefiting 100 times more off of the information we give you I. These surveys than we EVER will ... just a lil food for thought alright folks !	negative
2361	1462195529	lifestyle	1	"Don‚Äôt get the app!  A lot of the surveys don‚Äôt give you the points if you do them in the app (gets stuck on the confirmation screen).

You can do the surveys on the website, but prepared to get screwed A LOT.  Somehow surveys ‚Äúfill up‚Äù even though you already got in and started it.  A lot of times you finish the survey and it says that you completed it, but Survey Junkie says you were disqualified or it filled up and you get 0-3¬¢.  Pretty sure the survey company is paying them and then SurveyJunkie just pocket the money and give you a lie about why you didn‚Äôt get paid. You can make money, but SurveyJunkie is not ethical or fair.

Even the surveys are troublesome.  You shouldn‚Äôt be able to get kicked out of a survey when you‚Äôve answered over half of the questions and spent 15 minutes doing so.  If they can‚Äôt determine whether you qualify before that length of time, something‚Äôs wrong. They‚Äôre basically getting your input, but then not rewarding you for it with the loophole of ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt qualify.‚Äù  These are like people who return a meal for being ‚Äúunsatisfactory‚Äù after they have eaten the majority of it.

Also some of the surveys have pre-qualifiers and they take way too long, with no rewards.  Just kind of a shady way to get people to answer questions without paying them for it, even though they are supposed to pay them.  Time is valuable, so please don‚Äôt waste people‚Äôs time if you don‚Äôt want to follow through with the agreed upon price"	negative
2362	1462195529	lifestyle	5	I downloaded this app because I had nothing to do and I wanted to give it a try. I did all surveys I could and next thing I almost had $5 for redemption. Tip: if you use a laptop it‚Äôll give you more options of surveys and more points! Anyways, after 3 days I accumulated $7.43 and I received a call to verify and I did and then they sent it to PayPal which then I transferred to my bank acc. I bought something online that was $1 and I was shocked when it worked!! This app truly works you just have to be patient. I also downloaded Eureka and I accumulated $10 and they said they would sent me the money in about 3-5 business days... it has been 3 days and NOTHING!! This app though sent me the money right away after I verified it was me. I would recommend this appüôåüèª	positive
2363	1462195529	lifestyle	4	Was doing well then out of the blue they locked me out.  No warning, no message why they did, and now I could not redeem my rewards.  Customer service is a joke, you send them a message and you only get an email saying they will get in touch in 48 hours and should not send another inquiry.  That was 4 days ago.  Since I could not redeem my rewards unless I talk to customer service, I thought there was a number I could call but noooooo... You have to get into a queue, without even knowing what place you are in the queue.  They don‚Äôt even tell you if you should ‚Äúre-queue‚Äù again if you don‚Äôt get a call from them.  I‚Äôm starting to think this is a scam where they let you think that you can earn money one or two times and then locks you out, unable to get your reward.  SMH	negative
2364	1462195529	lifestyle	1	I‚Äôve been using this app for a while now, and up until this point, it‚Äôs been kind of fun taking surveys and getting cash for it. After my first cash out though, it seems like the app has just gone downhill! I click on a survey, it immediately says ‚Äúsorry, this survey is filled up‚Äù. No biggy, refresh the page, make sure they‚Äôre fresh, click another one, BOOM, same thing! Plus, I finally got a 10 point survey to work, and when I clicked to do more surveys, I noticed my point balance was THE EXACT SAME AS BEFORE I TOOK THE SURVEY! Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed, but it‚Äôs been stuck there for so long due to a lack of surveys to do that I have my point balance tattooed on my brain! I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs an update needed or if the virus situation has affected the app (in which case there needs to be an announcement made), but I‚Äôm honestly just feeling like giving up! Guess I‚Äôll have to tell all the friends I recommended to this app that it‚Äôs just a waste of time after all.	positive

We travel for the holidays so I figured, instead of playing mindless games or just listening to music, why not earn money. I took a lot of surveys and cashed out. Some surveys are annoying and you get halfway through and stop or say you don‚Äôt qualify and give you 3 points. I‚Äôve had a good amount of success and it‚Äôs a good useful way to spend my time when I‚Äôm doing literally nothing. I recommend this app if you have a little patience, time, and good internet. 

I do see a lot of reviews saying it just kicks me out or the survey is a joke and I don‚Äôt qualify for any, do make sure to sort your surveys and it gets better results so you can earn more easy money."	positive
2366	1462195529	lifestyle	5	So i found this website online and was like hmm i need some extra money so... i started. i don‚Äôt have my computer with me all the time so i got it on my phone and have just been filling out/grinding surveys for like 2 days and then i reached 5 dollar point where you can cash out. I was like this better work so i cashed out it said wait up to 5 business days and then i waited like 3 days and BOOM the money was in my account it‚Äôs awesome now i can buy discord nitro :D. So if anyone is wondering if you actually get your money and if this is real then, it is. The only cons about it is surveys are a pain to go through and sometimes it will say sorry you are not fit for this survey take 3 points which eventually adds up but still!!! it‚Äôs great!!!!!!!!!	positive

2368	1462195529	lifestyle	1	I regret the time I invested in this app. It seemed okay at first but performed progressively worse as time went on. Surveys do freeze or kick you out after answering most of the questions. I‚Äôm and honest person and put effort into answering to the best of my ability but would get randomly disqualified after spending many minutes in a survey. I also had the experience of completing an entire survey for 15+ minutes and then being disqualified. I answered every single question. I also have had the experience of the surveys crashing and freezing after answering most or all of the questions and not even being paid the 3 cents you usually get if disqualified. Even without these issues the time you spend on it has very small reward that isn‚Äôt proportional to your effort and it isn‚Äôt justifiable to spend the time on it. Apple should probably not allow what are essentially scam apps on its platform either.	negative
2369	1462195529	lifestyle	4	"Update 1: I only get 3 survey options now and they all take like 20 min I prefer to take short surveys for less points so I hope they change this I get this on the website too so really hope I get more survey options besides just 20+ min surveys

Note: The website is better surveys are easier to complete since less likely to crash on you (almost never crash) they can still disqualified you at the end but at least you won‚Äôt crash as often

Update 2: Better. More options for surveys not forced to take only the long ones now which I love I honestly was pretty angry when I couldn‚Äôt redeem but now that I can this app is one of the better survey apps along with Qmee. Easy payout requirement I still give it a 4 star since the app crashes a bit or won‚Äôt let me into some surveys but when I can do surveys it usually goes smoothly

Note: Don‚Äôt be mad at survey junkie be mad at the survey makers if you get a survey from (?)sampleolish(?) don‚Äôt even bother they will string you on for hours and disqualify you it isn‚Äôt survey junkie fault they do this but I wish they didn‚Äôt accept their surveys offers for their company another reason this app is 4 stars"	positive
2370	1462195529	lifestyle	3	While I enjoy the app and being rewarded for taking survey. I keep running into a few issues consistently. The biggest being crashing when I‚Äôm at the end of a survey. I‚Äôll be taking one of the longer surveys and right as I finish I get the message ‚Äúthis survey has filled up‚Äù and don‚Äôt receive my points. How is that fair? I was actively in the survey for 15-20 minutes and once I finish I get 3 pity points because it ‚Äúfilled up‚Äù which feels like a scam. Two other big issues I have is the lack of surveys even loading or not qualifying for 10 surveys in a row sometimes. Countless times I‚Äôve clicked on a survey and it crashes and I have to completely close the app. I also think that SurveyJunkie should give one surveys based on the information they were given so they actually QUALIFY for some.	positive
2371	1462195529	lifestyle	5	Survey Junkie is one of the best if not the best to use to make some extra money! I‚Äôve made $110 in two weeks, which helped pay for my little trip recently. I would suggest using a laptop because there‚Äôs surveys that pay more and some surveys only operate using a laptop. Some of the surveys are fun to do. I get see new products coming out, I‚Äôve watched TV and ads from a lot of companies. Answering honestly will keep you in high demand and certain surveys will be recommended to you daily to earn quite a bit. You can make roughly $10 a day if you have the time and patience and cash out SAME day. Highly recommend!	positive
2372	1462195529	lifestyle	5	This is by far and away the best Survey rewards site there is. The most important thing to remember, YOU AREN‚ÄôT GONNA GET RICH BY DOING SURVEYS. You get a small reward for doing a small task. The way I use Survey Junkie, is I save up as many points as I possibly can for Steam sales. This app/site has probably paid for the vast majority of the steam games I‚Äôve gotten over the past 6-8 months. Saved me a ton of money on games. Like I said, it‚Äôs slow going, but it builds over time. Easily enough to buy you lunch a few times a week if you whip out your phone when you have a free moment. This is a great app and a great service. Just gotta know how to use it!	positive
2373	1462195529	lifestyle	1	"So contrary to the the previous reviews this app appears to be a scam. Maybe awhile back it was better, but basically almost every part about Survey Junkie is a scam. Some examples include, but are not limited to, Survey‚Äôs that collect info, but don‚Äôt complete, hence don‚Äôt give you rewards (a lot of the experience), the Survey‚Äôs that aren‚Äôt legit (claim to be finding other surveys), the rewards given for surveys aren‚Äôt actually given, etc. My hope is that someone will come up with a more honest app for this idea and eventually fade this one out, but as most companies don‚Äôt want to pay people for surveys that is very unlikely as is with the validity of this app.

What this comes down to is a lot of your info is given out to people who you do not know and most of the time you are not rewarded for it. Oh well, I thought it sounded to good to be true and that‚Äôs exactly what it is."	positive
2374	1462195529	lifestyle	1	So I downloaded this app hoping for a fun and easy way to make a bit of extra cash. I did not get what I was looking for. The surveys are long and obnoxious to fill out. They ask you the same question over and over and over until you want to scream. They also don‚Äôt even tell you what the survey is about before you start so you‚Äôre blindly stumbling into a survey that may not even apply to you. If the survey doesn‚Äôt apply to you they‚Äôll let you fill out the ENTIRE FOURTY MINUTE SURVEY before telling you that you don‚Äôt apply and giving you a few points out of pity. And on top of all of this the most you can earn for your trouble is $1. That‚Äôs right folks. A whole dollar! It‚Äôs not worth the effort unless you have an obscene about of time on your hands. You‚Äôll never make enough to make it worth it. Don‚Äôt waste your time.	negative
2375	1462195529	lifestyle	1	"I have played with this app for a few weeks, enough to get to the lowest cash out option. The surveys do not always work, sometimes crash without giving you any points or string you along before finally saying you are not qualified. But I kept playing with it to get to $10. 

However, you can‚Äôt cash out your rewards by any option by default except bank transfer. If you want to get an e-giftcard or PayPal you have to go through extra versification via phone call. However, there is no option on the website or the app to request a phone call. I have tried contacting support multiple times over the past few weeks and have either gotten no response or the same automated response with outdated or flat out wrong information. Customer support is awful and this app is a waste of time."	negative
2376	1462195529	lifestyle	1	The 5 star reviews are likely the ones the app tries to get you to make before you‚Äôve even tested it out! All the one star reviews are correct! You spend all this time doing a survey just to find out at the end that you don‚Äôt qualify or the survey filled. It doesn‚Äôt make sense that they allow to to pretty much take a survey in full, to then say it‚Äôs met the quota and give you a mere 2 points. Seems to me that they are scamming people out of their time to answer surveys for pretty much free. Here‚Äôs a suggestion: DONT MAKE SURVEYS AVAILABLE IF THEY ARE FILLED UP! Its as simple as that. The customer service tried to give me some excuse about how ‚Äúsurveys can fill while you are taking the survey‚Äù but that‚Äôs a load of crap. They can easily monitor the traffic within a survey and close it out before someone new joins. Do not waste your time with this app.	positive
2377	1462195529	lifestyle	1	How this works... you get surveys to take. Every survey has points and the time it‚Äôll take to do it. Most surveys are worth 10-50 points. Every point equals 1 penny. My experiences on these surveys are... you click on to take a 15 minute survey worth 20 cents. You spend 10 minutes answering questions and then are told you don‚Äôt qualify for the survey or that‚Äôs it‚Äôs filled up. Sometimes they‚Äôll give you a penny or two for your time.  Yes you spend time answering questions believing you are taking a survey only to find out that you‚Äôre answering questions for free. I wrote to the email address asking about one that I lost 10 minutes of my time for nothing and never got a response back. This is not worth you time unless you want to help them make money off of your time while you yourself are given a couple pennies.	positive
2378	1462195529	lifestyle	2	They give you a survey to do and halfway through or 3/4 way through after they‚Äôve got plenty of your information and responses all of a sudden it‚Äôll either freeze or see the survey is now all of a sudden full and you‚Äôll get no points but they‚Äôll have plenty of information from you. Also, I had finally gotten enough points to cash out and to my surprise it said PayPal wasn‚Äôt available for my account or a gift card wasn‚Äôt available for my account either after they advertised that these are the ways you can cash out but they only left me the option of using my bank account so I was supposed to give this random app my account and routing number I suppose also who even said I had a bank account???	positive
2379	1462195529	lifestyle	1	After spending several days trying to figure out this site I decided it was not worth my time. A 50 point survey may take you 15 minutes or more. At that rate I am maybe making $2 for an hour of my time. And you run the risk of getting partway through the survey and being told it is full or you‚Äôre not eligible. Multiple times I finished a survey and the points never showed up on my account. The app seemed to glitch quite often. I was not able to redeem my points through e-gift card and did not want to enter my personal bank information to get the $5 I earned. Most surveys asked for personal information like date of birth, if it‚Äôs anonymous why do I need to enter personal information? It seemed sketchy to me. Others may find it useful but it‚Äôs not worth my time and effort.	negative
2380	1462195529	lifestyle	3	I have only had this app for 2 days, BUT I am very used to survey apps and how surveys work (or are supposed to work). For the fourth time in only two days I have been forced to exit a survey that I had spent quite a bit of time trying to complete. I had to exit because the entire app glitches and freezes me out, I can‚Äôt type, and I can‚Äôt get out, I have to completely reload the app in order to get back to the home page. Also, I have a problem with the fact that I‚Äôm not told when a survey is full until I‚Äôm done taking the survey??? What a waste of time! I enjoy taking surveys, but this app is very flawed and needs to be fixed immediately.	negative
2381	1462195529	lifestyle	3	You CAN make money off this app however don‚Äôt expect much. This isn‚Äôt a side hustle worth your time and is certainly not a way to make a lot of money. I made about $16 in one month. You can take as many surveys as you want but the system shuts down after a certain amount of surveys and gives you 3¬¢ for ‚Äútrying‚Äù. At most you can make about $1 a day. Surveys that actually pay decently take about 20-30 minutes to complete and you still get less than $1. At this point, you might as well get a minimum wage job. You can only redeem your points for cash once you have at least 1000 points ($10). But good luck getting 1000 points in less than a week.	positive
2382	1462195529	lifestyle	5	"I was skeptical to use this app considering the negative reviews and it requiring more personal information than I was comfortable with but after getting through the identification process I‚Äôve cashed out over $30 already in just a few weeks. It obviously isn‚Äôt something you‚Äôll get rich off of but it does bring in some extra cash. 

I‚Äôve been doing surveys for many years and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I don‚Äôt qualify for everything but the more you try, the more opportunities start coming in."	positive
2383	1462195529	lifestyle	3	This app is great, until you realize that you spend 5 minutes answering prequestions just for the survey to fill up. Even when it says you are in, the page then goes to saying that it is filled up and you get a couple points. There has got to be a way to make sure that the survey doesn't drag you on because it looks hopefully every time. It is really difficult to qualify for a survey, and even when you do, no matter how fast you click it and answer (honestly, of course) it is filled up. I want to get the $10 so I can get the money I already earned, but it looks like it is going to take forever to do so.	positive
2384	1462195529	lifestyle	2	"You‚Äôll think you‚Äôve already started a survey but halfway through it will start you on a completely different survey, makes me think they‚Äôre completely honest. Also expect to get an email in all caps every 5 minutes. Estimated completion time is untruthful and the points system isn‚Äôt very straightforward.

Also some surveys limit your choices based off your previous selections even when they have no correlation  i.e ‚Äúhow do you feel about...‚Äù basically pigeon holding you into selecting the non-grayed out options.

They also usually revolve around weirdly personal info about your banking. I may be being too scrupulous but this app gives me a bad feeling."	negative
2385	1462195529	lifestyle	2	I don‚Äôt often write reviews. I decided it was worth it in this instance to potentially save someone from wasting their time. I have repeatedly done 15-20 minutes surveys only to get to the end and be told ‚ÄúI do not qualify‚Äù or ‚Äúthe survey filled up‚Äù and wasted my time getting 0 points in some instances. If the surveys actually gave you the promised reward more often I would give this app more stars and be much less frustrated. If you feel like you would be frustrated by this problem as well skip this app. If you still want to do whatever you can to try and get paid for answering surveys no matter how much time you waste then go for it.	negative
2386	1462195529	lifestyle	5	This app has been keeping me busy. I get to cash out at $10 . It‚Äôs really easy to get to the $10 if you do it consistently. The surveys aren‚Äôt bad some are the same so if you get 1 and then get that same one again later on you are guaranteed to get the points. I would also say mix it up sometimes , do some from the computer then some on your phone . Always check your emails to see if they sent you some surveys too , but be quick with it because the get filled up fast ..	neutral
2387	1462195529	lifestyle	5	You always have surveys to do... and the more points you make the more money you get... I made $10 in 2 days... How much can you make? This app challenges me everyday to see how many surveys I can do to see if I can make for points than yesterday just to get money transferred to my paypal and it‚Äôs real simple. You can cash out as soon as you hit 500 point which is $5.00.

Today I started out with a 4 min survey for 20 points and then it switches to another 15 min survey and then after finishing that survey it switches to another 30 min survey AND after finishing that survey it stops and says your not qualified for the survey and gives you 2 points.  AFTER doing 40 min of surveying on a 20 point/4 min survey it gives you 2 points. REALLY! This site mostly is a lot of questions for THEIR benefits, NOT yours.	negative

There are plenty of other surveys out there. But now they are refusing the release the $30 of earnings I had accumulated prior to bring suspended.

Go to Swagbucks instead. It‚Äôs a much better app without the scam factor you get with Survey Junkie."	negative

I think they just alert you so they can show traffic to their site.  When you start a survey that is short and has a decent payout. You get half way through it and it kicks you out or freezes.  And no payout then it refers you to a 25 minute survey for 35 points. I‚Äôm a little fed up with survey junkie and their B.S.
In all fairness when I first started I was able to get my first payout in just a couple days.  doing just a few surveys.  But since then it‚Äôs been a bunch of crap."	negative
2391	1462195529	lifestyle	3	"This app gave me some problems. First of all some of the surveys that I‚Äôve completed only give me 3 cents for my hard work. Second, one time i tried to take a survey and it wouldn‚Äôt work for some reason and I lost my prize. Third, sometimes if I was honest about my age it disqualifies me from a quiz for many reasons. Don‚Äôt try this app and also you need 500 points minimum to get a reward. So you need to take many surveys to even try to gain your reward.

3/20 Update: their customer service was helpful to me and they gave me some points which was great so thanks for that SurveyJunkie."	positive
2392	1462195529	lifestyle	1	"Like many others explained, who for some reason rate 5 stars instead of 1, this app is such a chore. I‚Äôve had survey apps that actually work, granted the payout Is always small for your time, but I‚Äôve never had a survey app like this one. 

If you‚Äôre lucky, you‚Äôll very rarely get 100+ point survey (100 = 1$) and if you‚Äôre extra lucky, you‚Äôll actually get to finish the big 30 minute survey and get the reward! 
9 times out of 10, you‚Äôll get 10 points (10¬¢) for a 20 minute survey, and half the time you ‚Äúdon‚Äôt qualify‚Äù for those, despite the fact you answered survey specific questions... and that surveys are suppose to catered to you... 

With this app you have to move extra slow, and be extra careful setting up your profile, or at least remember EXACTLY what you put when answering surveys, Because if you mess up one tiny detail (accidentally hitting the wrong annual income, or members of house) then you‚Äôll automatically be disqualified for ‚Äúdishonesty‚Äù or ‚Äúmoving too quickly.‚Äù

I swear you make more money (3 points = 3¬¢) than actually completing surveys!"	positive

2394	1462195529	lifestyle	5	So I will be honest lately I been a fan of swagbucks. I have tired survey junkie before but never really was committed to doing the surveys. Swagbucks was my go to survey. Just by comparing the two survey junkie is way better. Although swagbucks has more ways to earn points, it is really hard and time consuming to earn points. The fact that you can redeem money or e gift cards at 10 dollars is a great deal. With swagbucks you have to have 25 to redeem a paypal card. Survey junkie is the bestüòä	positive
2395	1462195529	lifestyle	1	I just spent 20 minutes doing a survey (excluding the qualifying questions which add an additional five). I have answered all questions and even gotten to the ‚Äúthank you for participating please click next to end the survey‚Äù screen. After all of my time wasted answering the questions truthfully and honestly, the ‚ÄúUH OH! LOOKS LIKE YOU DIDNT QUALIFY :0‚Äù message pops up. The funny thing is‚Äîthis message ONLY pops up with questionnaires that are worth 60 pts or more, or the surveys that are worth more in general. I‚Äôve used this app for several days and it is so frustrating because it always happens. I‚Äôve given all of my answers for a measly 3 cents when I was promised 26 times that (literally) upon completion (which I SAW was completed). Not cool.	positive
2396	1462195529	lifestyle	5	It‚Äôs not a scam people, I can tell you first hand that I‚Äôve cashed out many times onto my PayPal account, they really do pay you MONEY.  Some days it might be slow, but there are some days when you cash out really fast. If you have a day where your not getting any surveys; just log out and try again in an hour or two; you will get them. The points add up really fast, and if your using PayPal the money goes on your card immediately.	positive

And the kicker is most of the questions in the questionnaire are ones you‚Äôve already answered in your profile. So how about you match me to a survey for which I qualify? What a freaking waste of my time.

Also, it brought me all the way through to almost begin a survey, and then it said ‚Äúsorry, were not taking anymore responses at this time.‚Äù Not only was that an ENORMOUS waste of my time, but it didn‚Äôt even give me a back button or anything! I had to close out of the stupid piece of crap.

Don‚Äôt waste your time on this idiot app. The people who design and run this thing are not very smart."	negative

But I haven‚Äôt been able to do ANY surveys they‚Äôre either never available or there‚Äôs a mistake and I kept trying and trying and I haven‚Äôt been able to do a survey. It‚Äôs all a lie. You don‚Äôt really get to do surveys and in the middle of doing one it‚Äôll either freeze or close completely and be like ‚Äútry again later‚Äù after I‚Äôve wasted 10min if my time and got nothing in return.

This has happened 5 or 6 times now and I really am starting to feel I‚Äôm getting scammed to take surveys and not getting the real reward promised. They set you up thinking you‚Äôre gonna get higher points and be able to make money for taking surveys but it‚Äôs a lie you can never reach your cash out amount because it‚Äôs always like ‚Äúsorry this filled up‚Äù after you completed the survey.

2400	664575829	games	4	"Sometimes there bad updates, sometimes there are really good updates. I play daily, I‚Äôve spent my fair share of money because I wanted to, I did not need to. There are many difficult challenges- I‚Äôve seen ‚Äòem all. I‚Äôm on level 5239 - I have a family, a full time job, and this is my wake up & play and then relax & wind down game. One of challenges, fixing the submarine, hasn‚Äôt been available for quite awhile and that was one of my faves. The holiday events are ok, not my most liked challenge. I dislike the ones that are temporary that require collecting special items to ‚Äúpurchase‚Äù upgrades to the aquarium space. I wish the developers could just release like 100 levels instead 15 or 20 a week. But it‚Äôs acceptable. One of the best things in Fishdom is they aren‚Äôt any ads ruining the fun between levels or anything. You can watch ads if you want to by clicking the video icon, or not. No forcing. Awesome!

Another issue I see are the ads for Fishdom I keep seeing on other games I play occasionally- what‚Äôs up with those? They are seriously dumb. They do not represent the Fishdom game at all. They‚Äôre non-existent challenges not seen in this game anywhere (moving parts to allow water to flow so fish can escape, or outrunning a shark?!?!) Those are huge misconceived ads!"	positive
2401	664575829	games	2	After a year or so playing and on level 2024 I finally deleted this game. Enjoyed playing, didn‚Äôt spend money on it very often. Just got tired of the manipulative algorithm that would have you run out of moves or time with just one move to win. Also, annoyed when I still have a few moves but game won‚Äôt release the bubbles needed to finish level. So goodbye Fishdom, I won‚Äôt miss you and sure you won‚Äôt miss me. Also lowered my rating. The following is a previous review since I simply edited to say goodbye. Tiffer roll your eyes at this. Play this game as a way to unwind and mostly enjoy it. I spend some money on it from time to time but not much. A few times I‚Äôve almost deleted it because the game at times seems designed to make you spend money which I get, so I‚Äôm patient and stay stuck on a level at times for a few days. Really irritates me when the board is completely cleared and you have a few moves left and need only one more bubble but the game won‚Äôt release a bubble, grrr. Those are the times I nearly deleted. I also despise the new reward system of vouchers for designer fish. Yuck, those fish are ugly and I‚Äôd rather have the old reward system back where you get power ups. Another ploy to get players to spend. I‚Äôm in the 1700s on levels so been playing awhile. Maybe not much longer though if changes keep being made to squeeze me for money.	positive
2402	664575829	games	2	"An enjoyable match 3 game, but way too stingy with rewards; takes forever to earn enough to fill your fish tank, and so miserly with handing out gems you may as well forget about it. I hate the timed levels, you basically just have to keep playing them until you hit a turn that drops enough bombs to just randomly blow up all the tiles because there's just no time for studying the grid and planning a strategy. You need patience for this game, or else be prepared to spend lots of real coin in order to keep playing and advancing levels. GET RID OF THE TIMER!

Update: Now into the levels above 800. The game has only gotten worse. Now some levels have individual time bombs in the squares that you must take out before they count down and end the game before you're even out of turns. More and more it has become a matter of just taking turns until the level wins itself by dropping enough power-ups to complete the round. I'm getting very close to deleting the app entirely.

Another update: The game is actually CHEATING! For the last FIVE GAMES IN A ROW I have been left with nothing but one or two squid to capture, and the game simply stopped issuing new squid! I even used up my gems buying extra turns to clear this level, but still no squid popping up until after last turn has been played! That‚Äôs the last straw. Deleting now."	negative
2403	664575829	games	2	"I have Two issues with this game. First is if you lose and you can use nine diamonds to get five more moves it appears instantly and you can accidentally hit it. I have continued a level about 12 times. 10 of those were by accident when was absolutely no way to win the level in five moves. I think when you hit the button by five more moves the game should ask you if that‚Äôs what you really meant. 
Secondly, There is really no such thing as infinity play. They give it to you, yes, but you‚Äôre really only allowed to win one or two levels. When you get to your limit of levels you can win on an infinity play it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you are on an easy, hard or super hard level,  You‚Äôre simply not allowed to win. I was pretty sure that was the case but I tried it on my last infinity play. I was on the easy level and I played it for two hours of infinity play and never won. If I tried to use a booster they would place the booster in the absolutely worst possible place that would actually mess up what you have would have started with if you had not used a Booster. If you came very very close to winning, all Poseidon a lightning bolt would appear in the very spot you getting ready to do something with. Amazingly enough, as soon as infinity play had run out, I won the level.
I do not like games that are that contrived."	positive

We all live to work, and as we age, we slow down, we start forgetting simple things. I‚Äôm 60, I have never played a Video, or other Computer game. And, like lots of people my age, my memory, and focus isn‚Äôt what it use to be. I‚Äôm tired of hearing, and seeing bad things that have become a daily occurrence. My doctor suggested I try playing a challenging game, she said it will work but he brain, something involving strategy, focus, but fun. She suggested Fishdom. I have found it relieves stress, it‚Äôs very enjoyable and fun! Creative, adventurous, and everyone knows watching fish has a calming affect! It‚Äôs a blast! Not an identical aquarium anywhere, it‚Äôs interesting to create your own Aquarium World. I can‚Äôt wait to get home, and eDee use my brain! I‚Äôm almost at level 1300, and look forward to each new challenge. Plus, it‚Äôs great for any age group, and appropriate. Can‚Äôt wait for the next adventure!	positive
2405	664575829	games	2	Most ‚Äúfree‚Äù games have in app purchases available, and that is accepted. Fishdom makes it virtually impossible to complete levels (even if willing to wait for more lives) without spending ‚Äúdiamonds‚Äù which are pretty much (in any meaningful quantity) only available through purchase with real money. There are few chances otherwise. The advertised fun ‚Äúfigure out escape‚Äù games are virtually non-existent. They throw one in at the beginning to avoid lawsuits I suppose. You can ‚Äúwin‚Äù diamonds for your fishy bank which you must purchase with real money. There was a week time limit on this that I thought I could wait out and not pay. Nope, limit just resets. I admit I have spent money on this because it‚Äôs an easy game to play while sick (i.e. doesn‚Äôt take too much effort). You can win coins quite easily, but they are essentially worthless other than buying fish and decorations for your aquarium and giving you the occasional diamond or two. It‚Äôs entertaining enough, but not worth the cost to play. Even if you‚Äôre willing to stop and wait for new lives. Not enough rewards that aren‚Äôt worthless coins. When you do earn rewards such as infinite lives for a # of hours you are forced to claim them immediately rather than choose when you‚Äôre willing to spend another 2+ hours playing an iPad game. Just my opinion.	positive
2406	664575829	games	1	After playing 930 some rounds I‚Äôve noticed that the controls start to become real sloppy ... example when you go to swap to the emblems it will actually go the other way so you have to mainly click on each an individual item to swap instead of putting your finger on one emblem and move it to another when you try that it actually goes the other way so if you‚Äôre trying to connect the corner emblem to say to make a line of five it will sometimes go the other way and connect only three...... when you start using the explosive the mines the dynamite the firecrackers and so on it shows up in a meter .... you must fill up this meter and then it gives you this triangle looking lightning bolt the problem is every time you use those explosive they don‚Äôt really power up the meter like they‚Äôre supposed to which doesn‚Äôt give you those extra power ups so you got a watch out for that..... and there‚Äôs also the challenges select you‚Äôre supposed to clear out 24 bubble emblems well you‚Äôll have to spend six or 10 of your moves before any of those ones that you‚Äôre supposed to clear out will drop down hence you can‚Äôt win on the first round unless you spend money to buy these power ups...... it‚Äôs sad that they have to rip the game like this not only could‚Äôve been extremely fun but like a lot of Game Developers their greed has outweighed their talent for making a game fun	positive
2407	664575829	games	4	I originally downloaded Fishdom early of this year, however after a few hundred levels it finally clicked in my brain that I‚Äôve been playing similar (almost identical) games for years now. Fishdom has become my favorite go-to game hands down. The levels are challenging and can be incredibly aggravating at times. Especially when the levels cheat you. :/ Unfortunately this happens all too often to me, for instance I just finished a level that I should‚Äôve beat on the 1st try had it not cheat me out of my turns. It‚Äôs aggregating and not fair to advid players like myself who love the game. I wish this would stop happening and that I could be compensated some diamonds considering I‚Äôve beaten over a thousand levels. So I can only imagine how many times that‚Äôs happened to me. I wish there wasn‚Äôt a limit on the number of fish per aquarium or possibly joint-aquariums with friends! Maybe one day there will be a way to highlight our favorite aquarium overall in the profile section? And why isn‚Äôt there any additional ways of earing diamonds quicker other than purchasing them? All in all, thanks Fishdom for all of your wonderful underwater adventures! Can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs going to come out next! :)	positive
2408	664575829	games	4	"I like the game a lot.  I have the same complaint as others. You get stuck on levels and sometimes they are impossible to beat until the level gives you cheats. Don‚Äôt spend money often because you don‚Äôt get much for spending money. Maybe I just don‚Äôt have the skills to beat some levels but I chose this game for that reason. I like puzzles but don‚Äôt like spending a lot of time figuring them out if that makes sense. I‚Äôm on level 1300 so I guess I can‚Äôt be that bad at puzzles.  My point is a lot of days I can‚Äôt really enjoy the game because I can‚Äôt spent a lot of money on it and won‚Äôt but miss being able to enjoy mindless playing and fun decorating.

Maybe they could make a playing mode for people who want a big challenge.  Then again if it‚Äôs random and or the developer has made levels unbeatable until you have no lives or cheats I think they should reconsider that. I‚Äôd probably pay if I got more for what I‚Äôm buying because I‚Äôll play for hours sometimes when it‚Äôs easy. I‚Äôm having a good time! My bank won‚Äôt let me go down that dark road if I‚Äôm not going to win after paying.  Actually come to think of it as I write this I am pretty frustrated with the game lol."	positive
2409	664575829	games	3	"I have been playing this game for almost a year. I enjoy it very much, but I get caught up and to keep moving forward a lot of time after many tries , you need to make purchases which I think are way to expensive for what you get. I think you need to get more for your money. If you are not careful it almost becomes like gambling. I have spent way to much money on this game. Some of the boards are really not possible unless less you use diamonds you need to purchase. They do few offer some if select the diamonds on the daily bonus, but they aren‚Äôt even enough to continue on a game with a couple more moves or time.
Also right now it won‚Äôt let me play on regularly without a credit card to make purchases until I do an update and put in a credit card that it can charge. I dont want to buy anything now, I really want to challenge myself and stop spending money on this but I can‚Äôt even start a new game. I have been stupid and spent at least hundreds of dollars on this addictive game. So careful and also you are charged more than what you think you are paying.
I normally am really good at a game after all this time, but the boards do change as well, even if it‚Äôs the same board. So it won‚Äôt always start the same each time."	positive
2410	664575829	games	5	"Nice game; addictive üòÉ The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because you try a level over and over and end up buying or using gems for the extra moves to beat it; meanwhile you earn the bombs you needed (in the first place) when you continue playing that level (with gems) and you can't save those bombs when you finish the level. These bombs would have been nice having in the first place (maybe you wouldn't have needed those extra moves); so you actually spend gems and forfeit bombs that you just bought or earned just at the end when you lost the level BUT you can't use for the next level to win and you're right back where you started... you need bombs & you're not going to pass that next level unless you gems to get those few extra moves needed to win.
It would also be nice if we could replay previous levels for coins to buy new items or fish for our aquariums and earn experience points.
The levels shouldn‚Äôt be based solely on difficulty but on repetition to beat a level. There‚Äôs no where to go from here where I‚Äôm stuck. No more $$ out of my pocket. What are you guys going to do to keep your loyal players!?!"	positive
2411	664575829	games	3	"It's a fun game but sometimes challenging. I think it should take less time to get lives but maybe that's cause it's addictive. What is the deal with asking for lives, you get them and then they disappear? If I have the lives from friends then I should be able to use them, it‚Äôll keep me playing longer and then I‚Äôd wait the time for the new lives. For example, my thing just said I had 8 lives I believe, could‚Äôve been 4 (but I have had where it said 8) and it only let me have 2 of them, it took the rest away. That irks me and then I won‚Äôt play for a day or 2 cause I‚Äôm agitated.  Also, I think when you beat the ""event"" levels and receive an infinity lives for 2 hours, you should be able to start it when you're ready. Once you start you can't stop it, but if I beat a level and then get the unlimited lives for 2 hours, I end up losing it if I can't keep playing for that time period. It's a reward and you can make it to where you can't earn another one until that one is used but, it seems rather unfair that if I beat it and earn that at, let's say 10pm, I can't always stay up until midnight to use it. Or if I beat it at 8am and start work at 8:30am, I can't use it and therefore I lose it. That bothers me quite a bit."	positive
2412	664575829	games	1	Greed!!! The further you progress the more deliberate it gets requiring money to proceed. My Christmas tank is pathetic only because I wouldn't spend anymore money on extras so that I could proceed. I've spent a lot of money on this game & I was ok with it because it was a great game & worth the fun I was getting out of it. The higher I got the more I noticed the deliberate ways it was obviously not going to let me advance. When you have to pop the bubbles to complete the level & I had 10 or more moves left to get my last bubble yet there weren't any bubbles on the board until I reached my last 2 moves left & one drops not giving me any chance to get it. This has happened to me many times not just with bubbles, but the sqiuds as well. So how can people higher up the ladder get the needed levels completed to earn the bells & dress up our holiday tanks when it takes hours if not days to complete the harder levels as you progress into the levels 200 & higher. So yes this used to be a great game, now however I have no interest when all I can do is play 5 times before having to close it down & wait it out for 5 more unless I spend more money for another 5 minutes of play. It's sad because I really did enjoy playing it an even spending money on it until I realized I was spending more then the pleasure I was getting out of it.	positive
2413	664575829	games	2	"I‚Äôm now at level 4621 after having ‚Äúrun out of levels‚Äù once already, I saw a refresh and woo-hoo more levels (so now I can generate coins to decorate my tank).  And then ... in less than an hour ... I ran out of levels AGAIN and am expected AGAIN to play for keys or some team bs which is really playing the same levels but now they are harder (eg no lightning now less effective alternative) and NO COINS.  

This is a scam - it costs more to beat these non level ‚Äúlevels‚Äù which are otherwise the same as normal levels, but I dont make any progress in the game. Which seems to be what the developers had in mind?  I just want to work towards decorating my tanks and finish up my current tanks AT MY PACE - not yours!!! It‚Äôs ok if I have to wait for more tanks, but this situation is infuriating as there is no sound reason to stall my progress in tank star achievement without coins for winning these ‚Äúlevels‚Äù and this is a waste my boosters.  Really super disappointed.  I‚Äôm not spending another dime on this game!

I‚Äôve already spent a lot of money and time on this game and I‚Äôm THIS close to just walking away permanently.  Stop trying to manipulate the players - if you have unlimited key/treasure ‚Äúlevels‚Äù (with no treasure mind you) then you can give us coins for them -no excuses for removing the coins.  üò§"	negative

Another reason why I like this game is because all the fish that are there they all have a nice names and you can change them if you don‚Äôt like their names sometimes you can help other teammates that you have on your team like if they don‚Äôt have enough hearts and you can give them hearts to help them win their games and every time and you guys all like let‚Äôs say if it asked you to join a team game and you won the whole game you get to add up to the leaderboard it‚Äôs really fun and I think when you get this game you will be so happy that you bought the game

2415	664575829	games	5	I love this game and do play everyday. It is definitely my escape.  I don‚Äôt understand how people are complaining about having to spend money to beat certain levels. I do all the extras so that I can get the rewards which are coins and diamonds.  I have not spent one penny on this game and I‚Äôm on level 1685!!  All my fish tanks have 3 gold stars and I do not move on until they do even when the next tank is unlocked.  I also have most trophies and am on my way to achieving the others, those just take time.  My only complaint is I do not like when it asks if you want to continue on for 9 diamonds at the end of a game and I accidentally hit it while I‚Äôm still swiping on my game when it pops up before I can stop myself. So sometimes I end up losing 9 diamonds because I‚Äôm already committed to my move and it‚Äôs too late to stop. It‚Äôs frustrating when you are on a game and you know you have  no chance to beat it with 5 additional moves and that‚Äôs when it seems to only happen!!  Can that option be moved so that it pops up more to the corners or side other than same place as the try again spot?	positive
2416	664575829	games	1	On more than one occasion I have spent money to buy gems and boosters. The process went through and said enjoy your game with your purchases, but then the purchases were never received. I wrote to who I thought I should, giving them the date and time and nothing was done. A couple of times, a purchase didn‚Äôt go through, so I tried again, then I was charged double. Because Buthelezi time I bought it again, all of a sudden the first purchase, which said no money was taken from my account corrected itself. Literally for I g me to ha e paid twice for a purchase. I love this game, but someone needs to look into my account and see what happened. Especially for the purchases I made but didn‚Äôt receive at all. Why is it so hard getting in contact with someone who can handle these problems immediately? I went where I was supposed to go, then was told to boot another link, which would never open up. If this happens again, I will fervently find who I need to talk to and get some type of satisfaction. I‚Äôll also bash this game on social media with all my will and energy. I love this game, but I will not be ripped off. Especially when I do and have made a considerable amount of purchases. No other gamer has ever given me this particular problem. Make it right please. Thank you.	positive
2417	664575829	games	1	I love playing this game.  I have spent much more money than I ever should have on it to try to win challenges and aqua tasks. I have reached the higher levels now. My biggest issue is when I have to ‚Äúwait for new level‚Äù and can only ‚Äúlook for treasure‚Äù.  I do not like it because I can‚Äôt gain ticket and any bombs or extra lightning boosters are voided as soon as I clear the board. This amazingly seems to happen when I‚Äôm close to winning the challenges against other players (collect pearls, lightning bolts etc..). If the makers of this game want us to keep playing, levels should be available or at least allow us to use up remaining boosters and collect tickets after clearing a board.  It takes a ridiculously long time to collect the tickets that we need to purchase special fish.  I also do not like that we can only win gems with completion of challenges. I can purchase the highest amount of gems won cheaper than paying to win the challenges!! I have deleted this app before.  If I delete again, I will not reinstall it!  I have deleted this game again. It costs too much for a ‚Äúfree‚Äù game. You cannot win in higher levels without buying boosts.  What‚Äôs more, I removed my credit card profile and won‚Äôt let me play this ‚Äúfree game‚Äù without one being on file!  If it‚Äôs ‚Äúfree‚Äù, why do I need a credit card on file to play it?!?!	positive

     Fishdom is another take on bejeweled. I don‚Äôt even understand how Bejeweled is so popular. I personally never really got into the game and after a while they are all the same. But ups to you on the effort. I would pick Fishdom over Cookie Jam, but not over the Family Guy version of Bejeweled. The fish talk so that‚Äôs kind of cool. Quit trying to connect me to Facebook! Facebook, does not take care for its users and as long as it doesn‚Äôt I will continue my personal boycott. Thank you again, I appreciate your time. Keep up the good work.
      I am unfortunately going to be leaving the game, after a while it seems impossible to win without purchasing boosters. While I appreciate the fact that you don‚Äôt have ads, I would rather watch an ad than pay real life money. I have limited funds and I also realize limited time. Spending money on a game that truly only occupies time is just not worth it for me. The concept and the design while very cool, just encourages one to buy more things you don‚Äôt need. I am assuming buying decorations for your fishbowl is just another way to program a person to purchase unnecessary items in real life. Thank you for your time, and take care. ‚ù§Ô∏èü§óüòú."	positive

Now.....I really do not mind if weeks go by before I set to play again. Every game I have ever played has been ruined by trying to put too much in, and this is one of those games. I am not one of those people that don‚Äôt like change either....if it‚Äôs needed. I do believe you need to stay relevant, but at any cost? That‚Äôs where I draw the line. Most of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù is just stupid. Most people are looking for a game that they can play at their own luxury......to actually set and relax, but after all the changes I have a hard time combing the two. It is not all that relaxing anymore. I haven‚Äôt figured out the ‚Äúgroup‚Äù thing works. I tried to start my own, but no one bit. I don‚Äôt know how to get to know the people, what THEIR rules are or going to be (whoever starts the group gets to set their own rules?....what level you have to be at, etc...). There are too many issues to go into now because my review would look like a book, lol. But just a few months ago, I still would have given at least a three star (some changes weren‚Äôt too bad, yet), but just not happy with at this point. I do hope that changes and I can start to enjoy my game again.	positive
2420	664575829	games	1	After playing Fishdom off and on for years, I decided to try again.  To my dismay, the booster rewards are not plentiful, nor frequent. I‚Äôve been playing the same level, which is identified as hard, for the past week!  I don‚Äôt know how to get out of this level without buying additional boosters.  There isn‚Äôt a way to continue the game without finishing the level.  I‚Äôve completed all but one task multiple times and must purchase additional lives to continue.  If you don‚Äôt have extra money to play this game, I can testify you won‚Äôt get very far.  I‚Äôm amazed at the rating this game gets, with it being touted as a game for ages 4 and up.  I‚Äôm an adult, with a masters degree, and I guess younger players are more capable than me.  My message is player beware.  Purchasing additional lives are the only way to reach the higher levels.  Unless, of course, you have unlimited time to continuously play the same level week after week.  Even when additional rewards are awarded throughout play, they drop in randomly and take away moves that are beneficial to the player.  So, money and frustration are the outcome of playing this game.  I don‚Äôt know how other ratings can indicate this game as relaxing.  Very disappointed with this newer version of play since the game‚Äôs origination.	positive
2421	664575829	games	5	"Used to be enjoyable.  Nice graphics.  Cute concept.  We all like challenges....if it were too easy we would lose interest.  But recent update (????) added a squid rescue feature.  The squid themselves are cute, and added a nice challenge and twist to the game.  Level 331 however has a feature, or maybe glitch???, where a window pops up randomly in the game that effectively ends the game.  The box says the squid are in danger and you MUST call in the dolphin requesters.  Which requires 18 gems.  If you do not pay the gems, the game abruptly ends and you lose a life.   I've been on this level for over a week now.   I've used all of my gems, all of my bonus items like bombs and hammers.  I actually broke down and spent 0.99 just now to ""finally"" pass the level since I had already cleared 7 of the 9 dolphins and all of the pearls when it popped up.  Guess what?  Still lost the level.   I refuse to spend any more money.   And losing the same level approximately 150 times in the last week and a half isn't fun.   I'm done.  Way to lose customers Playrix."	positive
2422	664575829	games	5	You should have gotten a bigger rating but you make it so hard to even move up with the hard level some of the hard levels is easier to beat them the regular levels I hate the ones that you are on a time limit but the sad part about this game is to be able to move to different aquariums and you decorate them the way that they are to be decorated to make them beautiful to make other people want to look at your aquarium and want yours to look as beautiful as there‚Äôs the new fish with the tickets are awesome but you never can get enough tickets to even be able to get a beautiful fish that would match your aquarium Nuts that you have up can make it aquarium look really nice but there again you don‚Äôt even get enough not to be able to buy anything of any day since it is a shame that this is such a fun game and could be a much better game and get more people to play if you were able to purchase the items to make your aquariums look nicer and to be able to move up to the next aquariums without it taking you weeks to do so	positive
2423	664575829	games	2	"This review is my first ever of an app. I downloaded this game after being barraged by adds in another game I play. The ad had cute life-saving opportunities for a fish caught in a maze. So I downloaded the game to save the fish! Well, that's not the game at all!!! In two weeks I've been given one chance to play a short 5 second maze. That's it. 
I do like the aquarium and it's fun to decorate. The fish you can acquire through points are cute too... until they make you feel bad for not being able to go up a level. 
However, THE TIC TAC TOE TYPE GAMES ARE UNWINNABLE and then when you loose 1-5 games in a row... you're given a time 25+ mins to return and lose again and again and again. It's just no fun to loose over and over. I won't pay for coins, gems or anything to help me win ever. I don't mind watching ads like in WORDSCAPES for bonuses but I will not ever pay! 
Hope this helps someone who likes to win because you won't win this game without paying! 
2nd Post ... After the post above I won... a lot! So weird it was right after I posted... now I'm stuck again. Never getting the bombs needed to win. Never able to pick the right daily shell. Never being able to win is infuriating... the aquarium is cute... NEXT!"	positive
2424	664575829	games	2	The fish are adorable. However, I‚Äôve played several match 3 games in my time, and I‚Äôve never seen one that is this difficult to progress in, even during early levels. I‚Äôm only on level 34 and have encountered many levels that seemed impossible to complete without boosters (which you can earn in game, but can also be bought with real money). I‚Äôd love to continue playing, but the levels are very frustrating, and I‚Äôm unwilling to constantly feed the game money to progress. I‚Äôm only at the beginning, I don‚Äôt even want to think about how ridiculous levels must get later on. Also, it takes far too long to unlock the regular fish and it takes so many tickets to unlock the special fish that I doubt I‚Äôll ever be able to unlock any. If the game were rebalanced to be more playable, and released for $5-$10 (with no micro-transactions) I‚Äôd probably love it. In the state it‚Äôs in now, I‚Äôll be deleting it. If the devs ever decide to rebalance the game, or introduce an easy mode that‚Äôs more geared towards those who just want to collect cute fish and decorate their tanks, I‚Äôll re-download. But for now I‚Äôll stick with Cats Atelier, which also has adorable graphics and characters, but is actually fun instead of frustrating.	positive

I do not have the money to spend on games so I get to enjoy the freebies only. Sometimes I have to play the games for several day before I can win. My best chance on the hard ones is to wait until the next morning when I get the daily bonus. There have been several times that I have just walked away for several days because I get so frustrated. I don‚Äôt like clams and not fond of the oil slicks. I would like a way to terminate a game if I can‚Äôt get through it even it if cost me my earned points. I have trouble with timed games. When I can‚Äôt get thru a game, I wait until my grandson comes to visit and he usually gets it on the first try!! 
All in all, I love my fish! Sometimes I get online just to feed them and see them talk to me! It is a really good game for me but wish it were less stressful! I know the games are meant to challenge us but some of us seniors can‚Äôt meet the challenge, give us a way to retire from those we can‚Äôt win."	positive
2426	664575829	games	4	"I rarely review apps. I got this one and Angry Birds match at the same time. They are both visually lovely and fun to play. I prefer this one because you can, with patients and strategy, beat the levels without actually having to buy anything.  The game gives you gems which you can trade in for power ups or more turns if you run out on a level.  That‚Äôs always been enough for me. I haven‚Äôt actually had to spend any money. There are no ads, so that‚Äôs nice. As a levels get harder, I may actually spend money to buy gems‚Äî but it will be worth it for the gameplay so far.  I‚Äôm at level 154 currently.  I even got into decorating my aquarium, which at first I thought was lame. This is a good one!

UPDATE:  Eventually this game is too hard to win without buying gems or using power ups. Even the regular levels. It‚Äôs annoying. And it‚Äôs totally rigged. It‚Äôs all about the ratio of pieces. And I have bought gems, but now I‚Äôm at the point where I have to use something at every level.  Frustrating. Annoying. 

DEVELOPERS:  Don‚Äôt annoy your loyal players and purchasers with impossible levels. Not fun. Not satisfying. üôÑüôÑüôÑ"	negative
2427	664575829	games	5	I am addicted and obsessed with FISHDOM!!!  I play almost everyday, but I am bummed that ALL my fish don‚Äôt get fed and ALL my aquariums don‚Äôt get cleaned.  It‚Äôs also a drag that new aquariums aren‚Äôt opened quicker.  I‚Äôve got almost a million coins I want to spend!!!  Come on developers, I need your help.  Some new fish would be welcomed too.  I love the last two you added but I want more.  I also wish there was a way to temporarily disable the fish activity.  They seriously impede me when I‚Äôm trying to rearrange my aquariums (which I do alot). Same goes for Sir Goldflipper and Herman and his bathescape.  While I have your attention I have to mention how much I hated the recent Christmas event.  I was so relieved that you returned to the format that allows us to buy what we want!!  I have a crazy amount of Christmas ‚Äústuff‚Äù in storage.  I need a special Christmas snow globe aquarium for all of it. One more thing, when I visited my friend‚Äôs aquarium today it was empty.  What‚Äôs up with that?!?  I hope you‚Äôll consider my suggestions and complaints.  Thank you for your time.‚ô•Ô∏è	positive
2428	664575829	games	5	The different themes are enjoyable, the seasonal quests are quite nice and there are great prizes and the end, The Aquarist Club above ground is nice although it doesn‚Äôt come with anything; kinda hoping they collab with whoever controls the Sims Mobile (if you know the difference between Mobile and FreePlay, you‚Äôll see where I‚Äôm going) so that fellow aquarists can, actually, play out the storyline of the club as a family heirloom....hoping. Otherwise; it‚Äôs a great game! There‚Äôs always some type of event or competition going in order to win boosters and life which helps with those hard and super hard levels. Aside from that, there‚Äôs a news panel to keep up with Fishdom on all platforms. You can chat within your team as well. All the tanks and items are very diverse especially the animated decorations. For those who can‚Äôt afford Tanked tanks, for those who just live in small houses although they can bank an exotic aquarium, for those who just simply love the game and the various themes such as Space, Beach, Tropica, et cetera, this is a HIGHLY recommended game!	positive
2429	664575829	games	5	I have been enjoying this game for well over a year. When I first started playing it was fun but had a few problems ie some puzzles too hard, required me to spend too much cash. HoweverI stuck with the game as I really did enjoy decorating my aquariums and it was fun to try and beat the tough puzzles. The really great thing is that the creator of the game kept working on the game, making it better and better. If you are persistent you can eventually beat all the puzzles (even if you don‚Äôt have much money to throw at it.) also the creator has added so many other activities and events that there are always a ton of different things to do. And he/she has figured out how to make joining a team with members from around the world an option. It seems like there is a new feature all the time! Thank you Playdom for trusting your team of creators of this game. Thank you for giving them the time to work the bugs out of this gam. It really is getting to be a great game! Gotta quit now and get back to playing. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. üòÅüëçüòÉüëå	positive
2430	664575829	games	4	I love this game. I love how you can buy fishes, decorate your own aquariums, how easy it is to get coins and also some of the levels are fun. The only reason why I give it four stars is because the amount of moves you get on some levels are just too short and ridiculous. I get that this is one of the many ways the programmers gain their money off on, but there would be levels I would be stuck on about 15- 20 times in a roll until I finally had enough and decided to buy with real money more diamonds and power ups. And my diamonds would get used up easily where I would be without any diamonds and power ups the next 5-10 rounds. I would say I‚Äôm a sucky player if this was the case, but I can even go all the way on level 300+ on similar games like these without having to use my real money to buy the stuff I need in order to ‚Äúdesperately‚Äù get to the next level. I love this game but I just wish they‚Äôd continued to give us power ups when we keep defeating levels non stop, because that really helped a lot.	positive
2431	664575829	games	5	I like the fact the you can open one shell on a daily basic and win and item from diamonds to bombs.  Also the trophies and cleaning your fish tank earns rewards.  I don‚Äôt spend money on this game at all, but it is slow going to advance.  Some levels are so hard it takes several days to complete , that frustrating. I would like to see some changes like 1) when you win infinity it automatically goes into it, I think you should be able to choose when you use that, 2 ) if you use your diamonds for additional chances or time and it only takes one to complete the level you should only use one and get the rest back, 3) you recently offer complete levels and fill whale with diamonds to win but then at the end I‚Äôve completed levels and filled the whale Now you want me to pay for the diamonds in the whale.  That‚Äôs. Not right as I completed the levels already so the whale diamond should be mine as I already finished the task I should not have to pay fo4 them now.  That seems underhanded and greedy .	positive
2432	664575829	games	5	I love the Fish but if you choose to play this game, you don‚Äôt want to be in too much of a hurry to be in the upper levels (1ks). This is where Fishdom never plays fair to us for our customer loyalty. For every special holiday feature where we upper levelers play to earn the unique fish WE get cheated out of it! The lower you are the easier the games your playing, so you can win them but if you are higher up forget it! The games are mostly ‚ÄòHard‚Äô Levels and it takes forever (plus your ‚Äòhard‚Äô earned cash) to win a level, so you can‚Äôt earn what you need to win those special fish. Fishdom makes it so you can‚Äôt even ‚Äòbuy‚Äô them if you purchase coins. They cater to you when you‚Äôre a low level bottom feeder only. They don‚Äôt give everyone the same opportunity to win the games and earn those special features. They only make it easy for the much easier lower level people to win them. I‚Äôve complained here before to no avail..they simply don‚Äôt care. Fishdom does not play a fair game in that respect.	positive
2433	664575829	games	1	"Why is it that you are fooled to click on the game that shows up on the screen for advertisements but when u download the game it‚Äôs totally different. In the ads your to either save the fish by pulling these knobs to either release what looks like lava and/or water. Figure the puzzle out to save the fish. The other games are two people, a man and a woman, are walking in the freezing ice cold and you have to save their lives by tapping on a three choice selection at the bottom of the screen. If u get the sequence wrong then a person falls in the water and the phone/device takes you to the App Store for a download. You try to download the game and it‚Äôs some match up BS. Why not advertise that part of the game? Or that the match up is included in the game. I have try to play along to see how long it would take me to reach what I started to call ‚Äúspecial parts‚Äù of the game and I dang near reached level 25 didn't get to play what is advertised at all. 

Is this what I think it is or am I not playin LONG enough? Is it cut screens. Like if I had to pay money, I would be requesting my money back. Please someone let me know what the deal is. I may be wrong, have no problem admitting it. So keep bashing to yourself. It looks like it to me."	positive
2434	664575829	games	5	I have to admit I‚Äôve never spent a penny on the game and I‚Äôm on level 2376. I love it. I just play it to relax myself.  Some boards are hard and will make you want to quit, but most are beatable in a turn or 2.there are levels that make you want to quit. I quit playing for about a week, then started again and beat the level. I use to play candy crush and got frustrated with it and decided to find a new game. This game. I like the game better because: 1. Feed the fish. It‚Äôs fun and you get new ones every week or two. 2. Free gems for feeding fish ( this is why I haven‚Äôt had to spend any money. 3. The holiday tanks. 4. Free rewards Daly, and bonus rewards or help throughout the week. 5. I‚Äôve never have to look at an add. This game could be total free if you choose. This is one of the best games out there, so give it a try. Relax, feed you fish and blow up some boxes with you bombs. Word of advise. Save your gems until you are absolutely frustrated with a level, and a a piece or 2 from finishing, or you will waste you gems. Enjoy	positive
2435	664575829	games	3	"I‚Äôve been playing for a while and generally like the game but there are a few things I do not like. The last couple of updates created a ""keep playing"" pop up window that shows up after each failed turn and is extremely annoying. In most games there is 'do not show again' option but not in this game, at least not any more. Another issue, when I try to pause the game it quits the game automatically and I lose my turn. It does not show any pause option, just quits. I don‚Äôt think it was like that when I started this game. Sometimes I forget and try to pause at the beginning, big mistake, am very unhappy. Like what others have said, I‚Äôm on some levels for days. Even using boosters doesn‚Äôt work until I‚Äôve used 10 or more. Lastly, Playrix likes to bombard the games with a lot of extra challenges. Sometimes it's just too many, one after another. I don‚Äôt mind them occasionally but do not participate in some of them because there is too much going on. In spite of the super hard levels, losing my turn, the extra challenges and that annoying pop up window, I still enjoy the game."	negative
2436	664575829	games	4	This has been my fav game from day one of playing, no other game gives as much extra stuff and creativity. I am however having one problem right now. Levels have run out and while I completely understand needing time to develop more, I‚Äôm loosing I interest in playing for the first time ever because the ‚Äútreasure‚Äô levels given while waiting for more levels are WAY to difficult. I don‚Äôt want to spending money, bonus lives or bonus explosives on levels that give me such a small reward that I can‚Äôt increase coins, get new aquariums or win competitions while waiting on regular levels to be created. If we have made it so far in your game to be at this level we have stuck with you Fishdom....so make the treasure levels while we wait rewarding enough to help us stick around. I am earning some bonuses but can‚Äôt win the treasure levels and when I do, there isn‚Äôt much reward. I‚Äôm also not sure why levels have run out when there are still 4 more aquariums showing as having been developed. I‚Äôm on ‚ÄúCrime Scene‚Äù, 1 start, at around level 4270 (approx).	positive
2437	664575829	games	4	"I get that the app needs to make money, so my gripe likely falls on deaf ears. It‚Äôs just that I think there would be plenty of people willing to spend their money for the diamonds and boosters, but there should be another way to purchase those things, too ie with the coins you earn like a nice old fashioned video game. I‚Äôm more stubborn than most but have even succumbed to spending my own actual money on the game so I can keep playing in my downtime. On that note it‚Äôs so aggravating to earn 1 or 2 hours of limitless life and not be able to choose when to use it. It seems I always acquire those when I‚Äôm ready to put the phone down, but c‚Äôest la vie. 

I do like that you don‚Äôt have to decorate the aquariums any certain way as some of the decor is hideous! The fish are cute and it‚Äôs always rewarding to buy a new buddy, I really wish they were a little more unique! At first I thought there was waaau too much going on, but now I love the deep dive and the seahorse booster challenges. Overall, this game is addictive and a fun time-waster. I play all the time."	positive
2438	664575829	games	4	***Update - Game is STILL too Expensive... Almost impossible to win games the higher up you get without paying extra for Time, Bombs, etc.  (1). Timer appears to be inconsistent from one game to the next!  There needs to be a physical TIMER that you can look at to see how much (or how little) time you have left.  (2). Also about 80% of time it is physically impossible to win the game without having to spend $$$ to have enough of a power advantage to win.  I hate playing the same game 20 or 30 (or 300+++times! - yeah, I must be VERY gullible) times over and over never winning - It quickly becomes BORING.  I usually am a dedicated player with these games, but I don't think I can afford to play this game for much longer.  The graphics are cute, but not worth what this costs to play long term. They need to create more room to encourage faithful players to stick around,enthusiastically even if they can only afford to pay to play occasionally.  The fish and Swag are well done and it is fun to design each new tank.  Wish I could afford to play more often.	positive
2439	664575829	games	5	"This is a great time-waster game.  I‚Äôve played it for the last couple of years now and it‚Äôs been one of the staple apps on my phone.  The gameplay itself falls in line with other Match-3 games, but there are also in-puzzle mechanics that challenge you in unique ways and fit the ‚Äúaquatic‚Äù theme (e.g. oil canisters, frozen pieces, coral that can only be broken with bombs or matching the same color next to them, etc.).

However (and this is a big one for me), I have recently stopped playing this game.

The devs have pushed out an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù where they redesigned all of the game board pieces.  Pieces that were once clear, distinct, and cleanly drawn have been ‚Äúimproved‚Äù with a more childish and blurred design.  It LITERALLY gives me headaches trying to focus on those pieces.  I simply can‚Äôt play this game anymore.  For others, this update might be fine and it might be for you as well (especially if you are new and not used to the ‚Äúold‚Äù way), but for me, I‚Äôm done until this change is reverted, if ever."	positive
2440	664575829	games	4	"Don‚Äôt let the impatient people fool you. You do not need to spend all your money. I‚Äôm on a team. I‚Äôm in the gold league whatever that means. I have 3 aquariums already. And I haven‚Äôt spent a dime. Sure you might be stuck on a level for 2-3 days sometimes. But that‚Äôs video games. You used to play video games for 2-3 months and wouldn‚Äôt think twice about it. Nowadays if you can‚Äôt beat it in 24 hours everyone says you have to pay to win. Which isn‚Äôt true unless you‚Äôre one of those that had to have every available item and advance to the top tiers right away. Then sure, go ahead and pay. But it‚Äôs not necessary. 

Honestly, the biggest frustration with this game is that, when you‚Äôve been away for awhile it says your tank is dirty and needs cleaning. They hand you a sponge and tell you to wipe the ‚Äúscreen‚Äù clean like you‚Äôre cleaning the tank. But then they say it‚Äôs ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù after like 3-4 swipes and the sponge goes away and you‚Äôre rewarded. Uhh tf it is not! Either let me clean the whole thing or take it out of the game.

You can name each of your fish whatever you want, and to make things even better, they know how to make you feel good! YES, the fish talk to you and it‚Äôs all compliments. 
You can  hook it to your FB account and play with all your friends. Then once I get bored and/or it's gets frustratingly hard I just delete the app, stay away for awhile then re-download right back where I left off. Easy-peasy.
BTW... you don‚Äôt have to spend real money. If you get aggravated and can‚Äôt seem to beat a level, STOP! Play something else for awhile. Really. I‚Äôve collected extra boosters and diamonds over time and don‚Äôt use them unless I absolutely have to. I get 1hr here and an hour there to play and so I just don‚Äôt use any boosters. So anyone that complains that they need to pay their bills and buy food and this game is unfair seriously need to re-evaluate their lives! Seriously!"	positive
2443	664575829	games	3	The game is enjoyable and there are a lot of perks to the game. I love buying stuff for the aquarium. I say that the game is rigged because once you get to the second set of aquariums they make some of the levels impossible to win UNLESS you pay for boosters. It does not matter how good you are if the game does not provide the moves they just are not there. I understand that the game has to make money and that is the whole point for the developers however what they fail to realize is that I will spend money on it when I get paid but on the days that I don‚Äôt have the cash they should not make them unbeatable because people will loose interest because then you realize the only reason your even getting passed certain levels is because you paid for it. Plus I‚Äôm not gonna play the same level constantly until I spend money on it. I will loose interest in the game altogether and then the game REALLY won‚Äôt get my money. Also major false advertising. When I first downloaded the app it was because what was advertised was a COMPLETELY different game set up!!!!!	positive

Just like the casino slots they know how to line up every move when you think your so close and you just have to complete the level, however surprise surprise your out of moves! Oh $.99 no big deal to stay in the game when only need to move one piece. (Rarely happens that you clear it at the higher level without paying a lot more) nothing is free! Hahaha yes the psychology of it all. I keep falling for it $10 $20 later...I have coins to decorate the fish tank but have to spend another $2.99 to open the Purple Heart lives I‚Äôve accumulated over the days. It‚Äôs a rip off. Can‚Äôt change your coins in for lives. They keep you hanging onto the reel like a Vegas slot machine. Have fun. Addicting as always. No one to blame but myself to continue to support these ‚Äúhouse always win games‚Äù üòÇnot worth it honestly. You can spend $10 on something much more lasting. And I‚Äôm sure other players spend more then $10 or $20. Check out other games! Going to write the same review for housescapes! I will say housescapes is even worse! Funny thing is downloaded the app for my nieces and I am the one that got sucked into it! Have fun however beware!	positive

As if that‚Äôs gonna help. Face it, developers. Everyone here hates your game. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the good reviews are fake. Instead of luring in everyone with fake ads, advertise your game as it is. Or if you don‚Äôt wanna change your ads, change your game. It‚Äôs just so cruel to attract people with innovative ideas only to then be jerks and reveal that your game is just a poorly made version of Candy Crush. While I do admire y‚Äôall for showing the world your innovative ideas, you‚Äôre being jerks by pretending to be unique when in reality, your game is just candy crush with fish. Instead of receiving all this hate, either delete your game, change your ads, or change your game. Maybe then people would admire Playrix instead of identifying it as a group of frauds that trick people into downloading their apps, luring everyone into their ripoffs of candy crush, force people indirectly to spend all their money on power ups until they‚Äôre broke, and finally delete this dumb app because they finally realize what it really is: a scam.	negative
2446	664575829	games	3	Changes in the game never seem to be in the best interest of the player, but only to increase revenue. The game is fun and artwork is excellent, but over the years, changes never seemed to improve our gaming experience. A few years ago they introduced aquatasks, which were the best thing to happen. But back in December they did away with them and replaced them with the ‚Äòseasons‚Äô event. Similar to aquatasks, but not quite the same. I figured it was OK, and I dealt with it. Until the event ended, and I thought ti would start again. There were a certain number of challenges you had to meet, and when they were done, you had to wait until that event was over and a new one would begin - or so we thought! So far it‚Äôs been close to a month, and nothing. I am afraid with the event called ‚Äòseasons‚Äô there will only be 4 a year, and each one only lasts a little over a month. So I‚Äôve lowered my rating again. There have been a lot of complaints, so I‚Äôm hoping they will rethink this. I‚Äôm not playing as much, as many people have said, and that‚Äôs probably a good thing on my end.	positive

2448	664575829	games	3	This game probably has the cutest graphics but once you get to the higher levels it is impossible to get through unless you spend 2.99 twice a day.   I unfortunately found it to get too hard and unenjoyable in the upper levels.   It‚Äôs a shame that the game got too greedy.  Update: so now I‚Äôm over a year into the game.   I have spent a lot of money.     It is a fun game and I‚Äôm at the highest level now and I feel with the exception of a few levels that are really hard and make you lose interest, that overall new additional levels seem to be reasonable.  The game will eventually allow to beat each level.  You just need to have patience.   The fishies are adorable and fun and their little personalities are precious. Just know this:   These games are set up by an algorithm that are meant to generate money.  Just like any other game.   Further update:   I‚Äôm done.  Out. Once you get to the highest level that the game has, you only have the option to to play their special levels which are impossible unless you pay approximately 2 to 3 dollars per level.	positive
2449	664575829	games	1	I was having fun with this game until I got to the level where you cannot play the game without spending money. I don‚Äôt mind running out of chances and having to wait, but in this case you open the game board and all squares are basically blocked one way or another. Even if you purchase to get special tools, you have to buy a lot of tools and even then may not make it to the finish. It is a matching type game where all but 3 - 4 squares on the whole board are accessible. The ‚Äòspecial‚Äô icons are unusable as they have to be used in conjunction with a regular square, but you have no access to a regular square next to them unless you use a purchased tool and even using that tool does not insure you will get a square you can use. There is no way to skip the level, and you get to the point you cannot even play the level even if you use the special tools as you will get a message there are no more moves and the game is over. I will be deleting this game and make sure I don‚Äôt load other games by this company on my iPad. Thankfully I learned this lesson for $1, but still angry about it. Please be careful and don‚Äôt spend money on this.	positive
2450	1494449873	games	3	So first when I was getting this app I thought it was going to be ad-free. But nope I was so wrong. I love the game and all and it's extremely pleasing, but well it's just the advertisements that run it. So here is the big problem here; I just hate advertisements in the middle of gameplay. It's just annoying and disturbing in my opinion, I know there are subscriptions that you can take to remove advertisements in some games, but sometimes when you need to save budget because of hard times or something, it's going to be very annoying. My family has a budget that we have since we lost money because of Covid 19. (The worldwide coronavirus.)  And I absolutely hate advertisements, so I'd like this app more without advertisements regularly. I do know advertisements are very common in apps. If I use the app a lot I‚Äôd not really care that much. But if I just got it or don't use it often I would care A-LOT. So it would just be better if you remove the advertisements (ads). Well, thank you for putting this time into reading my short review. You could read this if you wanted to get the game (I suggest you do.) or if you're a developer of the app. (Also I strongly suggest you do too.) Many thanks from Navi.	positive
2451	1494449873	games	4	It is so satisfying, especially the vibrations when the cream comes out. I love that you get different cremes, different valves, different toppings, and different foods. I have three problems but they‚Äôre not big. Once I collected all the foods, at the end the only food they ever use are Swiss rolls, so I hope they switch it up or add more foods. Also there are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY too many ads. Also sometime the videos don‚Äôt work and it never stops loading. I also have suggestions to add on. Like there could be a way to customize customers as an add on maybe or you should have more than one customer. There could be a way to drag the food over to the customer so they eat it instead of just clapping. There could also be something that lets the client/gamer to pick what they want to be boxed in the end. I love this game so much!!!! Also the bonus games are awesome!!!! Lol üòÇ! I hope you enjoy it! And sry for the long review if anyone reads this! ü§£	positive
2452	1494449873	games	5	Wow I‚Äôm very shocked. I did not know what to expect with this game. I thought it was going to be like a dumb cream game I wouldn‚Äôt play. But I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised to say Immensely enjoy this game. It‚Äôs extremely good and I feel a lot of satisfaction when I play this especially when I unlock different colors of cream that add even more satisfaction. The sound affects are also surprisingly good and make it feel like your actually there. I like how you really never lose at this game. I wound give it 10 stars if I could. By far my favorite game. The only complaint that across the board most other reviewers have is just there is way to many ads and sometimes the videos don‚Äôt work even if I have WiFi it‚Äôs Monotony and very tedious even though the game is great that is just a little constructive criticism.	positive
2453	1494449873	games	3	Ok so this game is soooo awesome!!!There is lots of levels and so much stuff to satisfy you!!!But there is 2 bugs...one of them is that why so many ads?!Well ok...this doesn‚Äôt really bother me as much as other people find it super annoying but every time you finish a level there is an ad!!!I don‚Äôt find this annoying because ads help us find new game experiences so I don‚Äôt really mind and without ads I would not have found this game so I‚Äôm not that angry with that one...then there is number two which is that I have gotten all the frosting different fruits and more stuff...but yet I still don‚Äôt feel satisfied that there is enough!!!Like in the food section there is only like like 16 things!!!Ok that might seem like 16 is enough but when you actually download the game you see what I mean!!!Anyways other than that awesome game and good luck to those who decide to download!!!!	positive
2454	1494449873	games	5	The game itself is pretty fun, but the ads are extremely excessive. Each round of gameplay is rather short, and ads play after every single one. You only spend 20 seconds, at the most, actually playing the game, then after that you get twice that time or more of watching ads and receiving coins and stuff. It‚Äôs really annoying to play a game for maybe 15-20 seconds, then having almost a minute of just waiting before you can play again. I played a couple rounds and counted, and on average you only frost 5 or 6 items, and around 10-12 on bonus rounds. If the ads where less frequent, or even if the levels lasted a little bit longer, the game would be much more enjoyable.	positive
2455	1494449873	games	3	So this game is very nice. I love the soothing way they made the cream look like. I really don‚Äôt have any issues with this game. The only thing is that I would love if there was like an endless mode that just keeps on going or maybe longer levels. I know you can play different levels, but sometimes it feels like the level ends quick. All I want is either longer levels or an endless mode. Other than that, I love this game. Keep up the good work! So this is a day later from my first review and I‚Äôve found a big glitch. So when I got to level 80 or 86, if I pressed the cake icon,where you can select the creams and stuff, it would just shut down the game every time I pressed it. Also when you finish a level, it automatically shuts down too! I really need this to be fixed. Once they do I will give this game the five stars it deserves.	positive
2456	1494449873	games	4	So I downloaded this app cause my cousin told me a satisfying asmr game so I did. I started playing it for awhile but there is a small issues here. First of all it would give the option to watch an ad for a chest to get more coins. But if I press ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù it still gives me an ad. It‚Äôs kind of annoying but that‚Äôs really the only problem is that. So overall I recommend downloading this app if your into asmr. It‚Äôs a really good game. It also doesn‚Äôt take internet to play it. Another thing is I love the bonus round. The game is creative and free. Nothing cost money in this game from what I‚Äôve heard and experienced. Definitely going to play after this. I would check out more about this developer. Thanks for reading this review, sorry it was long. I hope this was useful!	positive
2457	1494449873	games	4	Now I love this game a lot. When ever I‚Äôm stressed this is definitely the game I would go to. I have a lot of fun with chests and all of the things you can buy. But somethings really bother me. One there is a add every 5 seconds. Other games don‚Äôt have much adds. Every time I am done there always like 3 adds. I just want to play the game!!! One other thing is why can‚Äôt it keep going? I hate the end where you put all the decorations on I just want all of the desserts to keep going and going... there is always something at the bottom of my screen and when I press the ex a new game thumbnail comes on. I am not trying to throw this game under the bus or anything, it‚Äôs a really fun and simple game. I just think this game can use a couple changes and a lot more people will play!!!	positive
2458	1494449873	games	5	Perfect cream. An outstanding name for the perfect game. Creaming is my favorite task as a pastry chef, I love creaming but as of our day and age being consumed by the carona virus I am unable to cream. Not only is his game satisfying but very entertaining and is a great escape from my uncreaming lifestyle. The perfect cream helps me practice my precision whale I cream and gives me beautiful sound effects and visuals that I wouldn‚Äôt normally get walst I cream. I love this game so much! I named my pet hermit crab creamy cream in its honor. This game provides the perfect cream, it gives you a variety of colors and objects to cream on. People need to see this amazing app, it really brings you to reality, a life changing experience is within the perfect cream, don‚Äôt you ever forget it.	positive
2459	1494449873	games	1	When I saw my friend play this game I asked what was it called so I can get it on my phone. Well at first I was excited to get the game and to play. When i started the game it was a good intro into the game. It teaches you haw to play and it very good. Right after the intro there was an add. Witch is ok bc I know that all games have adds. Then I began the next level. Right after I finished there was another addü§®. I was ok with is but not so satisfied. I started the next level ok kinda upset but still wanted to check it out. I no longer then 5 seconds of the add when I finished level 2 there was another add. I could not even get the chance to start a new level without an another annoying add. This is very upsetting do to how satisfying the game is. I do not like that at all. Therefore the game will be removed from my phone and hope that it gets better. Well that was a big let down for me hope you understand what I am talking about. (ü•±üòí)	positive
2460	1494449873	games	4	I really like this game. My mom got it for me and it is super satisfying. But I have a few complaints. Every level is very very short. There is an ad after each one and I feel like playing this game is wasting my time. Also, the game can sometimes get very glitchy. I think that this game is satisfying, but it is very repetitive. You do the same thing over and over, and there isn‚Äôt any way to fail a level. All you do is put cream on things. I think that there should be more obstacles. Make it at least a little harder and make levels a little longer. Other than that it is a great game. I gave it four stars because it is very satisfying and oddly calming. Thanks for the great game, but please stop wasting all of my time with all of the ads!	positive
2461	1494449873	games	5	"Don‚Äôt get me wrong- I play this game daily and i love it!!! I‚Äôve had to delete it twice because of one issue- whenever I get past level 30 or something around that, and I go to change my icing or my pump, it glitches and I‚Äôm kicked back to my home screen. Now, this may be because I‚Äôm still iOS 12.4.1, but it does happen a lot on an iOS 13 device I own. (That is up to the latest software.) 
Also, just a suggestion- add an endless mode! I love the game, its just that the levels are too short. I would love to play without any interruptions that aren‚Äôt ads, as in, getting kicked out when I change my pump or my icing in that little menu."	positive
2462	1494449873	games	3	I downloaded this because I thought it looked satisfying and like something I could do when I was bored. I do play this game a lot, but it‚Äôs getting kind of boring. It‚Äôs the same levels over and over and over again. Also, THERE ARE SO MANY ADS!!!!! And a tip: if you don‚Äôt want any ads, when you‚Äôre playing the game, turn off WiFi and turn on airplane mode. This works for any app/game with ads. And if you want the cream sound, turn on your ringer or check the game settings. Anyways, it‚Äôs fun when you don‚Äôt have anything to do, but when you‚Äôre looking for something thrilling and exciting, don‚Äôt open this app. There are more ads than those super short levels and there‚Äôs not much to do. Overall, I rate Perfect Cream 3 stars because of this.	positive
2463	1494449873	games	3	I liked this game more than I thought I would. It was satisfying watching the cream come out and I enjoyed being able to upgrade items in my shop. There are a lot of ads, but for the most part you don‚Äôt even have to watch the whole ad. However, this is where the game falls short. I am bored now, and almost thinking about deleting. I go through the levels and I am earning coins for nothing. There is no more upgrades for the shop, no new colors of cream or new valves. I‚Äôm literally putting the cream on food and earning coins to just sit there because there is nothing to purchase. I am on level 220, which may seem like a lot but it takes nothing to get to. I just downloaded this game a week ago and didn‚Äôt play it daily.	positive
2464	1494449873	games	5	Ok so i know people are picky about games and get impatient when ads come on and stuff but honestly ads are like 20 seconds of your time who cares. this game is fun it‚Äôs like super satisfying just putting the cream on the foods. i know people complain about the ads and stuff but they aren‚Äôt as bad as they seem. plus you can always skip them so what are y‚Äôall fussing about? the only little complaint that i got is i wish the levels were longer like they are so short i got this game like three days ago and i‚Äôm already pass level 100. so i just wish the levels were longer and more challenging. that‚Äôs all üôÇüôÉ	positive
2465	1494449873	games	4	I like this app. Getting new frosting colors and new valves and stuff is SO fun, i like renovating the bakery and the satisfying sound effects are just icing on the cake! (Sorry. Bad punüòä) i DO have a few complaints though. I just got all the icing colors and tubes and finished renovating and I ha so EVERYTHING. But I keep getting coins! I mean what‚Äôs the point?! Also when I get 3 keys it still offers me a prize, but all I get is coins! My recommendation is making infinite renovations and icing colors and stuff. Or making the levels harder so it doesn‚Äôt get boring. Also I still don‚Äôt know how you go back and do other levels. Ya know, so you can get more stars on them. But otherwise I love your game just keep doing great y‚Äôall üòò.	positive
2466	1494449873	games	4	It‚Äôs honestly a fun and easy game to play when you‚Äôre bored and need something quick to play. It has a good style and it‚Äôs very smooth and natural with not too many weird physics. Also the ads all come at the same time and don‚Äôt pop up out of nowhere like most other ad-promoting games. One problem though, once you get to around the 80th level or so, it kinda glitches out. If kicks you out of the app when you try to open the little items menu or when you finish a level. Also the levels have become a lot shorter than they‚Äôve been. But once that glitch gets fixed, it‚Äôll be the perfect quicky game in my opinion	positive
2467	1494449873	games	5	As they say time goes fast when you‚Äôre having fun! And that‚Äôs exactly what this game does. People are always complaining UGH the levels are SOO short. But anyways who likes a long level? This game is amazing and I highly suggest it. Toppings and other stuff are SOO cute I wish I could eat it! And people have said UGH Why so many ads!? But there aren‚Äôt really that many ads unless you press the mystery box or get more keys! If your like me and always read the reviews before you download the app don‚Äôt listen to the people who say those things about this app. I almost didn‚Äôt download Perfect Cream & now I‚Äôm glad I did!	positive
2468	1494449873	games	4	This app is really really good but there were a few things that made me rate it a four star rather than a five. First of all, the ads! I can‚Äôt even play one round without an ad coming up. When it‚Äôs the end of a level and I try to just leave the game and come back in to get rid of the ad, I lose all my progress from the last round. Now I would buy free ads, but that‚Äôs leads us into my second problem. IT‚ÄôS SO EASY! Don‚Äôt even bother buys no free ads. I beat the game in a day. The levels don‚Äôt get more challenging and it‚Äôs just kinda boring after unlocking everything. Please consider all of this before downloading ‚ÄúPerfect Cream‚Äù	positive
2469	1494449873	games	4	"Ok, so this game is extremely mouthwatering and the minute I saw the ad for this game I said, ‚ÄúYOU NEED TO BUY THIS!!!‚Äù It‚Äôs really good stress relief and I play it when I feel upset. 
But, like every other game, this one has its flaws. First of all-this isn‚Äôt the first time-there is an ad after EVERY. LEVEL. See, I was hoping for an ad after, y‚Äôknow, 2-3 levels. Because that‚Äôs your average ad amount, at least for me. And, I‚Äôm sure you can all agree that consistent ads are a big pet peeve.
Second-the music when you‚Äôre creaming things is a bit annoying. So if you could change it, that‚Äôd be great, but seriously no pressure on this, but I think it distracts from the skill needed.
But there are many good parts about this game too, so I‚Äôm tryna focus on the positive now. For a first, the sounnnnnnds... 
are amazing.
And second, I love the variety of creams and valves! I can mix and match all I want. You‚Äôve done an excellent job with that, for sure. This is getting lengthy now, but take my suggestions into consideration!"	positive
2470	1494449873	games	4	I love this game and it is extremely addicting and satisfying. I love the features you can choose from: cream color, foods, and valves. And I love the animation and I think Playgendary Limited did an amazing job ü§©üòÅüíØ Although there is one problem. So, after every level of the game, it says watch an add to open this chest. And you can choose to watch the add or click ‚Äúno thanks‚Äù and if u click no thanks it makes u watch an add anyway so yeah that is my only complaint but other than that it is an awesome game. (And I read other reviews and other peeps are complaining about it so if u don‚Äôt want the adds, BUY THE FREAKING GAME like I did) üò§	positive
2471	1494449873	games	4	I downloaded perfect cream about two days ago and I am addicted! My suggestions for this game is that I just finished getting all of the valves, confitures, and foods and I feel like there should be more of them added and also more bonus levels should be added because the same two are getting a bit boring. Also, having the same lady customer each time is also boring and there should be different customers coming in. I really hope that these suggestions can be taken into consideration because it would make the game much more fun than it already is. Thank you!	positive
2472	1494449873	games	2	"First of all to many adds! And the levels are like SECONDS long, and u just shake a bottle to get the toppings. I wish you could choose topping and buy them with coins. And mix your own cream 
And choose your own chef and dress them up. And same for the shop I wish you could level up the shops. I got this game because 
It looked satisfying and fun and cute. These are the changes I would like the people who made this game make: make the levels harder and longer.  Make it too were you can make and mix your cream and toppings. Also to we‚Äôre you can choose your chef and store. And to were you can race against others. Last but not least, at least make it to we‚Äôre you can buy no more adds."	positive
2473	1494449873	games	5	"This game is probably one of my favorite phone games. It‚Äôs so relaxing and satisfying. 

There‚Äôs just a level problem. 
The levels are way to short and bonus levels show up way to often. I really like the normal levels and they give some variety to what you‚Äôre creaming, but they definitely aren‚Äôt as long as the bonus levels, and the bonus levels down have any variety to the stuff you‚Äôre putting cream on. And what I mean by the bonus levels coming too often is a bonus level is supposed to make you excited. Like, you played ten to twenty levels and you finally get to play a bonus level. But in this game, it seems like every fifth level is a bonus level.  

Again, I love this game, but the shortness of the normal levels and how often you see a bonus level kills me and sometimes makes me put the game down for a while."	positive
2474	1494449873	games	4	"OK, so i WOULD give this game 5 stars, because it's addicting, fun, and worth the download wait, BUT, there is ONE THING about it that DRIVES. ME. CRAZY. its the Open Now button, and it's in the most INCONVINIENT PLACE EVER! so, in the bottom left hand corner of your screen, you assume that the Open Now button is the back button, so you ""accidentally"" click it, and spend 500 coins on a food, a valve, a cream, or a topping, and it's SUPER ANNOYING when you finally realize that the back button is thet miniscule ""x"" at the top right hand corner of the screen. please fix this problem! üíóüßÅ"	positive
2475	1494449873	games	4	What I mean by that is there are at least 2 glitches I spotted in the game so far. One of the is whenever you get the macaroon, at the very end of the level it has the candy cane/cherry floating! Shouldn‚Äôt it be in the middle? That one didn‚Äôt really get in the way though. There is another glitch where I really wanted a new confiture, but it gave me a new creme instead! And whenever I wanted a new creme, it gave me a confiture! Please fix this to make me and probably most people happy! Thank you developers for your hard work! Keep it up! üòâ	positive
2476	1494449873	games	1	Okay so I hate when your icing the cake and then it just automatically think Tom your done and will take you to the smoother, it‚Äôs very annoying because sometimes I‚Äôm really not done, another thing is that even if you space out the icing it will still mix up the color, so when I try to put on less icing it still makes me put on more. And there‚Äôs an ad after every level and I wish they would try to cut down on some of them, unless these things get fixed I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. I don‚Äôt even  know why they have this many stars because this app needs a lot of work. Sorry I didn‚Äôt have anything good to say about the app but it‚Äôs the truth Have a great, day and stay safe.	positive
2477	1494449873	games	3	"I really enjoy playing this game, I was addicted to it. I installed it yesterday and kept playing and playing. I watched adds to get things, even if I didn‚Äôt HAVE too. I only had one more topping to get before I saved up coins to make the place look nice. I was like
   ‚ÄúYay!‚Äù I WAS going to keep playing until I finished the game...Then after I got the second to last topping I went to change my frosted thingy. When I clicked on the place where you change your stuff. The game glitched me out and it kicked me out of the game. I can play but I really want to change my thing. 
Please fix this, I‚Äôm begging you guys. :(
    -A sad player"	positive
2478	1494449873	games	1	I like this game. At first it looks really satisfying and simple. When I first went on it said Subscribe now! I didn‚Äôt want to waste my money so I didn‚Äôt. OH MY LANTA it‚Äôs add after add after add! The game also rates your cream with eMoJiS which is not their eMoJiS it‚Äôs the eMoJiS from your keyboard! üò≠üòÅüòé ) some emojis from it ) they can get sued by google and not to mention its 8 dollars a week for no adds! That would be.. 428 DOLLARS A YEAR FOR NO ADDS! Don‚Äôt waste your hard earned money and time on this stupid game! If they lowered it I would get it like 1 dollar. So many more people would get it = more money for them. There are better games out their that give you fuzzy feelings like this like fancy slime or bubble tea just to name a few. DONT GET THIS ITS A SCAM MONEY GAME	negative
2479	1494449873	games	5	I get this I gave this game five stars this because I love it it's perfect for me I wanna be a cook when I grow up so this is a perfect game for you if you want to be a cook when you go up to that you can make all types of desserts with frosting it's so looks so yummy and I love it because you can just like do you like a cook stuff like if you want to be like a dessert or dessert maker when you grow up so that's why I love it it's perfect and I love I love it because it has no add's.üòªüò∫üê¨üê©	positive

Don‚Äôt bother downloading. I tried it because even though people were complaining about the ADS it sounded like a fun game. It‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm not kidding when I say the ADS are longer than the levels. You play for maybe a few seconds and then the level is over and an AD immediately follows afterwards. It‚Äôs also pretty repetitive... this would get old quick regardless. There‚Äôs no real skill required to play, either. You can just hold down the button and spray cream everywhere and you‚Äôll still pass the level. 

The game also tries to force you to do the three-day free trial/subscription and pay $7.99 to go AD free. Upon downloading and opening the app for the first time you are presented with the option to pay to go AD free‚Äî it immediately pops up for you to purchase and input your password even without clicking anything! 

This game is money hungry and ridiculous. It has no redeeming qualities. Steer clear of it and don‚Äôt be pulled in by the pretty colors you see in the advertisements."	positive
2481	1494449873	games	3	"The only issue I have with this game is how an ad will randomly pop up in the middle of the level, and it doesn‚Äôt pause the game, so you miss most of the level. 

I don‚Äôt mind ads on free games, but having Radom pop up games mid level is definitely a huge mood killer for me. 

Maybe consider only using ads before or after the levels? Because if I keep getting mid level ad pop ups, I‚Äôll just uninstall since the ad break doesn‚Äôt actually cause the level to pause. I don‚Äôt wanna play half a level, I want to play the game the way it‚Äôs meant to be played."	positive
2482	1494449873	games	3	Ok, so what‚Äôs with the inappropriate ads? I don‚Äôt get it! This is such a good game, why? Ads in the first place are annoying but these ads are just plain inappropriate! Fix this slight problem and maybe I will play the game! Please! I‚Äôve been wanting this game, and the ads ruin it!!! Ok I‚Äôm back again! Listen after 2 days if you don‚Äôt fix this ad thing then I will delete!!!!! Listen to these reviews, during the covid 19 thing people are bored.

2483	1494449873	games	4	"This app is lovely and the graphics are my much better than I would have thought. The game relieves anxiety and calms you down. I love how you can unlock knew desserts to cream. However, this app has many ads. After every round you have an ad. Ad. Ad. Ad. Too many ads.
Also, there are many interruptions. With a calming game like this one, it is good to keep it rolling. The rounds or levels are short and really I just want to keep playing. The prizes are cool I guess, but all I want is to pipe the cream. Please take this into account."	positive
2484	1494449873	games	5	I love this game and can‚Äôt stop playing it, it‚Äôs a lot of fun and I love all of the cream, valves, toppings, and food I can collect. However, I‚Äôve already collected every single item. All the creams, all the valves, all the toppings, and all the food that are available in the game. Now, since I‚Äôve already collected everything, it‚Äôs a bit boring now. I want more of everything added so I can keep getting more and more stuff. Please.	positive
2485	1494449873	games	5	Soooo relaxing!

That is the only thing and I hope you will update so it doesn‚Äôt do that. But, a good game overall. Edit: thank you for updating and removing the glitch.	positive
2486	1494449873	games	4	Overall I enjoy the game. Obviously the Free version is inundated with ads to make the user want to pay the $2.99 to upgrade. My only complaints would be that I cannot go back and play previous levels from the beginning where I didn‚Äôt get 3 stars. Also the bonus levels are way longer (therefore more fun/challenging) than the actual game play levels. If the levels were longer I‚Äôd probably be more likely to pay for ad free.	positive
2487	1494449873	games	3	"First of all, this game is AWESOME!! It‚Äôs so satisfying. I personally enjoy messing it up! I have a few suggestions and a complaint. My suggestion is, at the end of your ‚Äòdream session‚Äô (I literally just made that name btw), you have a end cream thingy and you put cream on the eclair. My only problem with this is it‚Äôs not free hand like the rest before it. It kinda makes it boring, Just my opinion. 

My final topic: ADS. There is way too many ads. Some even interrupt game play. I find this very ridiculous to be honest. At the tend of the round, to double your coins, etc. This is completely normal, but I think that‚Äôs slightly over doing it. Also, when it gives me the option to double my coins or get a new item- sometimes I doesn‚Äôt give me the ‚Äòno thank you‚Äô option. Just some things to think about.

2488	1494449873	games	4	One day I saw my mom playing this game and I asked if I could buy it and she said yes so I started playing and then there was 2 adds before I could play the first level, then after I played the first level there was 3 more adds and I was like ‚Äò‚Äô what the heck ‚Äò‚Äô then I    played the next level and before I could play the next level there was once again there was 3 more adds, so I hope you understand what I‚Äôm saying so byyyyyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee	positive
2489	1494449873	games	3	I downloaded this because someone told me it was a good game, it‚Äôs a nice game overall, and I like the fact that it gives you different creme to choose from and new things to unlock. My only complaint is, why so many ads? There‚Äôs way too many ads, you finish one level, there‚Äôs an ad. As soon as you finish the next level, there goes another ad! I wouldn‚Äôt usually mind that, but the levels are so short you‚Äôre really spending more time watching ads than playing the actual game üôÑ.	positive
2490	1494449873	games	5	This is a great game, don‚Äôt get me wrong. But when people are starting to collect all the food, what happens next? I know you can upgrade your home screen, and get more cremes, configures, and valves, but more features, please? For example, I would like a PRO mode after when you collect all the food. And then like different stages. Beginner creamer, intermediate creamer, and master dreamer? I like a challenge! But overall this game is really good!	positive
2491	1494449873	games	3	"What I would really like from this game is for the levels to be more than 5 seconds long. And then an add longer than the levels come up! I would just want a long level, I just want to dispense cream interrupted! I don‚Äôt mind adds that much, except that they come up every minute. Once I got whammed with a double add, one after the other. I also don‚Äôt find the desert at the end of the level very necessary as you don‚Äôt even control it, you just press and hold. 

In short, I just want longer levels, please!"	positive
2492	1494449873	games	5	"This game is ver satisfying to me. I like the levels and the noise when the frosting comes out of the nozzle.
You should definitely get this game! It makes you feel accomplished and is very relaxing! Plus, as far as I have played, there aren‚Äôt to many adds.

2493	1494449873	games	4	When I got the game it was really fun. But the levels ended way to quick. That made it less enjoyable for everyone. Also there are so many ads. After every level there is an ad. Another thing is I can only find spikes in bonus levels. If you put spikes in the real levels it will make it more challenging and fun. Overall the game is great but I would like these things to be added to the game.

2496	1494449873	games	4	At first I thought that it would just be a boring game where you just press and it puts down cream. But it is so much more you can unlock different creams and different pastries. You can also give them to a costumer which I like a lot. I think to make it better they could have the customer order and rate you when you are done. And they could have more  ingredients to put down. Overall I think this game is amazing! I recommend it to everyone!üòä	positive
2497	1494449873	games	4	"It‚Äôs a great game, I‚Äôll recommend it to all my friends! But I got some ideas üí° to make it more fun. 
#1. To quick. The levels are very quick and I want them to be a little longer and more challenging but not too challenging. Like, if the cream doesn‚Äôt finish all the way you‚Äôll lose a few coins like 10 maybe? 

#2. More ideas üí° for challenging. If the cream hits the ground, couldn‚Äôt that be a ‚Äúfail‚Äù and start over. I feel like it‚Äôs very silly üôÉ to not include that. 

#3. Always the same person. When your in the lobby thing and there‚Äôs a man behind the counter then a woman üë© as a costumer. Why always her? And why can‚Äôt they pay üí∞ for what you made them? Why can‚Äôt you buy your own cream and toppings? 

Just some suggestions."	positive
2498	1494449873	games	4	So I just got this game but I have been noticing that the ads are not that good I think u should give us better ads I‚Äôm not trying to sound damanding or any thing but I think these ads are boring but other than that I think you should play this game it is very fun and relaxing üòé and if u have depression it will really make you calm and happy well thank you for reading my short message and I highly recommend this game	positive
2499	1494449873	games	4	This game is satisfying. When I first downloaded the app there are a few things you might not like about it. After finishing a lvl you get so many ads, and it gets annoying. Also when you tap to add cream, you might actually click on a advertisement, and everybody might not like advertisements. The game is really fun though. Trust you‚Äôd be addicted to it. I had this game for just a week, and now I‚Äôm better at it. I hope you üòâ it.	positive
2500	1500564080	games	4	"This game is absolutely amazing! It lets me change the floors, clean appliances, fix walls, change neighborhoods, and more!! It is very fun. I have only had this game for two days and I already know that this will be my new favorite game. It has kept me occupied for the time that I have had it. You might be thinking, ‚ÄúIf you loved the game so much why didn‚Äôt you give the game five stars?‚Äù Well, the reason for this is because there are so many ads. Whenever I complete one task it gives me an ad. This is frustrating because I love the game so much and I want to play it without being interrupted. Sure I could turn on airplane mode and not have to worry about this, but then I wouldn‚Äôt be able to receive new texts and I also wouldn‚Äôt be able to watch videos to increase the money I receive. I understand that the creators/company wants to earn more money by having a lot of ads, but I wish there weren‚Äôt as many. The thing that makes up for this is that a few seconds into some of the ads you can ‚Äúx out‚Äù, meaning you can get out of the ad. Otherwise, I love this game with all my heart and I recommend you buy it! ‚òªÔ∏éÔ£ø

2501	1500564080	games	2	"I would rate this a 5-star game, it‚Äôs amazing! But.. Why do you think I did not rate it 5-star? Because.. it has too many ads? Because it is not appropriate for ages 4+ though it said it is? Both of those, either way are correct. The ads are ùïãùïÜùïÜ inappropriate!! The ads contain the following mild/intense sexual dating, and nudity! I would say that is 17+!! Each time you try to build something or restore it, AN AD POPS UP. The ad doesn‚Äôt let you get out of it, so you get out of the app, (home restoration) come back, and you start ALL over again, not saying this game is bad, it‚Äôs great, I would give it a 3 - star, but no, it contains in-app purchases and it MAKES you pay!! It adds it to your credit card! No, I would not recommend this game. (So sorry for any spelling errors, or wrong punctuation. I am writing this from a teenager‚Äôs perspective.)Thank you for taking your time to read this. 
It is greatly appreciated."	positive
2502	1500564080	games	4	First of all, I think this game is pretty well made and it has some concepts that other games of this genre don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve found after awhile that it gets kinda boring because you‚Äôre just doing the same things over and over. Maybe in a future update the developers could make it so that you can upgrade a whole house. It would also be cool to have more upgrading options such as a leaky roof, or a pest infestation. The last thing I would like to see is more furniture options. You‚Äôre really limited to how you can style your house and what it will look like. Maybe there could be some sort of store to be able to buy cool items or even a competition to get people more involved. Sorry for this long review, but I hope the developers are able to add these things!üòå	positive
2503	1500564080	games	3	"I am literally ready to chuck my phone game developers. Please don‚Äôt take this harshly but this is only because I have no patience. This game is incredible it‚Äôs simple and looks cute. It‚Äôs satisfying and causes a person to think ahead. It has real life mechanics to the tools and is very interesting. As soon as I saw the ad I had to get it then I got it. Ad after ad after ad! After anything you do there is a 30 second ad! And the skip button disappears or glitches! It makes me come to this App Store again and again! Great game but can you ad like an ad block please! It‚Äôs so frustrating! I never write reviews but I love this game and rlly wanna keep it but at this rate I have no patience for this crap! So please please do something it‚Äôd mean the world to me!

2504	1500564080	games	1	I loved this game but really there are ad after ad after ad and at this point it‚Äôs very very annoying. There is an ad even after I watched an ad, and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs only me or not but the ad is the same exact 30 sec ad every single time! The ad does not even change it is the same ad! That is just frustrating and just every time you even press anything there is an ad. I literally clean the floor, there‚Äôs an ad, I put a design on the floor, there‚Äôs an ad, after that ad there‚Äôs another ad just to go to the other furniture! It is very annoying and I do not have the patience to play a game that is basically watching ad more than actually even playing the game. And to warn anyone who would just buy the no ad thing, there isn‚Äôt one. At this point I just deleted the app because it was very stressful and just annoying but overall without the ads it would be a much better game.	negative
2505	1500564080	games	4	"I really love this game!!! I‚Äôve searched for so long trying to find a real house renovation game. This is exactly the game I‚Äôve wanted to play. You can clean the furniture and fix up the walls just like a real life remodel.
The only annoying part is that the game lags A LOT. It‚Äôs really disappointing because I‚Äôm really into the game but then it just freezes. Also, there are never enough ads that you can watch to get the free furniture. 
I know that this seems really negative but I really do like this game. Please don‚Äôt change the idea because I love it so much!! Just a couple minor fixes could make this one of my favorite games! I really hope that you guys can do a couple fixes as soon as possible to make the play time more enjoyable. Thanks so much!"	positive
2506	1500564080	games	4	"Okay, first off overall amazing game. Fun process and satisfying tactics. The only issue I have is the ads. It is really annoying to have to get things using ads then thirty seconds later an ad that you did not decide to watch comes up. 
    It gets really irritating when the same exact ads pop up as well. And sometimes while I am renovating the houses I might have an ad pop up right when I‚Äôm in the middle of painting a wall or cleaning the floor. It gets very irritating because they come out at random times. Other times I might even guess when an ad is about to pop up. 
   So overall, good game. Just please fix the ads, it would do all of us a favor."	positive
2507	1500564080	games	5	"I absolutely love this game! It is so satisfying to watch the tools fix the problems in the house and how the furniture is so perfect for the design of your house. As soon as I had seen the add I thought it was going to be one of those adds that really want to promote there game so they make it look better than it actually is, but NO! It is 100 times better. 
I especially love how when you fix the broken walls or scratches paint you do the work and you don‚Äôt just do one swipe with the tool and it automatically fixes. 

This game is a must have. I have fallen in love with it since I got it 30 minutes ago."	positive
2508	1500564080	games	4	This game is really fun and is a really good time killer. I could play it for hours on end and never get bored. You can design the houses you fix and everything, it is a very creative game. The only thing about this amazing game is the amount of ads. There are so many ads in this game that it is very frustrating. I could go on and on about how the large amount of ads makes the game very annoying and irritating, but I do understand that the company that made the game wants to make money off of showing ads. I just wish that there were less ads. I do very much love this game though and I very much recommend it to my friends.	positive
2509	1500564080	games	3	"I thought I had finally found a game like this that i was interested in and that was fun, but no. This one has the potential of keeping my interest for longer than a day, but there are so many ads that it's not even worth it. I was 3 minutes into the game and I couldn't even get through restoring 1 
""project"" without at least 3 ads popping up, not before or after but during. i looked for the button to pay for it with no ads, but sadly, there wasn't one. I deleted it within the 5 minutes of it being on my phone, the ads are too much and the game isn't worth the annoyance of all the ads."	positive
2510	1500564080	games	5	I love this app. I‚Äôve had it for about three days and I have 50 mil. I have two problems with the app though. One, there are wayyy to many adds. I turn it on airplane mode and it works fine, but if I go to the end of the offers to gain money and it‚Äôs red and I turn the WiFi back on it rlly doesn‚Äôt work so I lose money. This brings me to my second problem. On the offers I think you should be able to go back through them and choose the best one. All in all it is a wonderful game. I strongly suggest downloading it.	positive
2511	1500564080	games	2	Normally I don‚Äôt complain about free to play games having ads, BUT this game is quite a bit over the top.. most level based games let you finish one maybe two levels if you are lucky, with this game I had 6 ads before completing one house.. now this house had 6 different things to do, each taking less than 10 seconds to complete, so why were there 6 5-30 seconds ads for maybe 60 second of game time? Anyways.. the game is fun to play and WOULD be playable if the ads were tuned down a bit, giving an ad every house maybe 2 would be acceptable and would make me want to play the game. For this reason I have given the game 2 stars and deleted it.	positive
2512	1500564080	games	3	"Ok so ya I love this game and all but first there aren‚Äôt that  many adds so people stop saying there are and second maybe developers if you tried you could maybe make it a little more in depth ( the game play that is) so one way you could do that is maybe have a whole house you have to fix with walls and windows to fix not just wiping off furniture and fixing floors and wiping windows and patching walls
Another thing is maybe not having a whole house but you can put the rooms together to make a whole house
Another way is maybe show the streets when your done with a street
Also maybe let us decorate a little more 
Ok so basically if you did that with the game I would never ever delete it but currently I might so maybe it‚Äôs a three star review ok not just four because of how shallow the game play is
So developers just do what I say and you‚Äôll make the game way better because let‚Äôs face it I‚Äôm almost positive you can make it better"	positive
2513	1500564080	games	2	This game is very satisfying and addictive. But I have a big issue. There are so many adds. Every time you finish one task, there is an add. Every time you finish anything, there is an add. Yes, I know that games that are free need funding from adds, but this is very annoying. I just wish that there was a game like this, without all the annoying adds. I would say download this game if you enjoy watching the same add for the 100th time in a row after you complete anything. Sorry if you really enjoy this game. ( To loosen that up, I really do like this game, just hate the adds.) If you read that whole thing for a honest review, you came to the right place. Thanks, and please, get rid of the adds. üòäüëçüèª	positive
2514	1500564080	games	1	This game is great, but the ads make it nearly unplayable.  I get that free games like this need ads to survive, and I‚Äôd be fine with that, if there was one after every level or so. But when each task only takes 10-30 seconds and there is a 45 second ad between each task, it‚Äôs not really worth my time as a player is it?  Each level can have up to 5 ads in it.  Ad to play time shouldn‚Äôt be equal, but that‚Äôs what it is in this game. Which is too bad, because it‚Äôs a fun game!  I could really just relax and chill with this app if the ads were properly balanced.  I hope this is something that gets fixed at some point, maybe I‚Äôll come back to the game then.	positive
2515	1500564080	games	3	I love the game. I like perfectionist type games. They‚Äôre great stress relievers. Unless there are so many ads that you quit playing. Seriously, I get an add after every single action. Fill the wall - ad. Plaster the wall - ad. Paint the wall -ad. Then to get the best furniture options you have to watch an ad for each piece. I would be fine with watching an ad voluntarily for better items and in between rooms, but to have one after every action is excessive. I would absolutely reinstall the game if the ads were cut down considerably. Until then, I have to say goodbye.	positive
2516	1500564080	games	1	This game is really good, but the only way to continue threw out the game is by watching a lot of ads. Like you would finish one part of the house then it goes to an ad. After the ad is done you do another part of the house then  another ad. It would be very lucky to not get an add after doing something. Then when the room is done and you can add furniture it goes to another ad but the ads get longer over time. Yes some ads are from getting higher free furniture. But this game could be really good with out all the ads. There isn‚Äôt even an option to pay the game to get no more ads. I am just saying that I would rate this game higher if there was not so many ads.	positive
2517	1500564080	games	4	I downloaded this app 2 days ago and I absolutely love it but a few things seem of to me. When you move through different levels I have noticed that the LEVELS REPEAT THEMSELVES! Also there are a lot of ads which I know your company wants to make money but don‚Äôt put an ad after every task. Another thing is that if I finish putting in the furniture then I click done THEN it adds more furniture. I feel that I should be able to put all the furniture that the game puts in for me instead.	positive
2518	1500564080	games	5	This game is for starters very good but the only thing is that there is a add after every single thing, if you clean something for like a minuet there will be add for two minuets fight after that. That continues for all of the steps of the process. They need to make one change to make this game better. No adds except for maybe one or two throughout the course you play the game	positive
2519	1500564080	games	4	"Dear makers of this game,

I love this game so much, it‚Äôs the most exciting game on my device! I love it because the game lets you design other people‚Äôs homes for them! But the thing is that there is so many ads. I mean I get the the makers of this game want money from the ads, but when I finish a task going on to the next, there‚Äôs an ad and it keeps on doing that. It‚Äôs kind of annoying. But otherwise I really recommend this game and I hope you will buy itüòÅ"	positive
2520	1500564080	games	3	I would honestly give this game a 5 star rating if there weren‚Äôt so many ads. Seriously! After every task you guys have an ad, I‚Äôve almost deleted the game like 6 times in the past two days because you can barely play it. It‚Äôs not even worth it if you‚Äôre going to jam ads don‚Äôt my throat every four seconds. I understand that a certain amount of ads is necessary so that the app can stay running, but this is way over the top. Just tone it down with the quantity of ads.	positive
2521	1500564080	games	2	The game itself is fun. But I get tired of watching ads after every small little task that you complete. It slows it way down. I understand that they‚Äôre trying to make money and don‚Äôt blame them. However the moment you say on the floor you have to watch an app but we can do the second part and then you watch an ad. On the times you can opt to watch an ad for something extra doesn‚Äôt hardly work but an ad pops up after you‚Äôre done excepting that you can‚Äôt. Would be a higher ranking game in my view if there wasn‚Äôt so many ads.	negative
2522	1500564080	games	5	Ok I never Write a review but this game is so fun I downloaded it not to long ago and after 2 seconds I was hooked it is so fun but then here‚Äôs the problem after you‚Äôve swiped out the okay and bad offers you CANNOT go back to the other offers it just really FRUSTRATES me please fix that so I can have FUN again then there‚Äôs the ads I haven‚Äôt seen many ads but they‚Äôre really ANOYING	positive
2523	1500564080	games	1	Now, I was playing a different game and saw one of your commercials, thought nothing of it and just watched. When the character was sanding the floor, they carved the shape of a penis, which wouldn‚Äôt be very pleasant for others to see. Other than that, you have waaaaaaaaaay to many apps for one to handle. I recommend that you take down the noted ad, and cut down on the in-game ads. Other than that, the graphics are horrible and often lags of my Apple Device. I will be deleting the app until I get what I want, and that is better quality, a few less ads, and that specific ad gone.	positive
2524	1500564080	games	5	OK, now that I have played the game, it absolutely AWESOME! I think it if I had to choose on a scale between 1 & 10, I would ignore that and give it a 1,000,000,000! AWSOME GAME. It is also really satisfying and fun. I love the graphics. Even my sister plays this game, and she usually does not play most of the games I do...üòÇüòÇ FUN GAME. You should think of making a few adjustments with the ads, but other that that, this is a five star rate game.üòÉ	positive
2525	1500564080	games	2	This game is truly amazing !! The cleaning furniture and fixing walls is exactly what I was looking for. The only annoying part is that there are a lot of adds, I finish fixing a wall, an add, I put a piece of furniture, an add. Also it really does freeze a lot and I have to get out of the app for it to work. Again this game is truly amazing but it could use a little fix and after this will be my favorite game. When I got this game I got sucked in, it‚Äôs so realistic in a way. I know this might seem mean but those are really not my intentions in this review. Thank you	positive
2526	1500564080	games	4	"This game is actually super fun and enjoyable. But like with most games, I‚Äôm seeing that after every renovation that it plays an ad. And the renovating part doesn‚Äôt take a lot of time, so it‚Äôs like 65% and the rest is ads. Now, understandable, they have to make their money especially on a free game, but still. At least tone down the ads to one every like two or three renovations.

Otherwise, amazing game!"	positive
2527	1500564080	games	3	Guys I love this app and totally think you should get it. But this game has a lot of ads, which to some weird people, that is great news. I however as a person have no interest in ads whatsoever! In which if you could play the game anywhere I would recommend a place with no WiFi or service.  And if the creator is seeing this, please take down some of the ads. It is like ad apocalypse every time I open the app. Thank you for listening to my review on the app.	positive
2528	1500564080	games	4	"This game is one of my faves but I need to report my opinion on some things and share my ideas that I think could make this better. 

One: When I go to buy a ‚Äúhouse‚Äù, I am most of the time disappointed. Only one room. I would like all of the houses to at least have two rooms and a bathroom. That would be more realistic.

Two: The insides of the houses I‚Äôve made all look pretty much the same. That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs only three options on furniture, appliances, etc. Could that please be improved??

Last: The buyers of the houses are the same six people. They also are just pics of them. Maybe the people could actually come and SEE the open house before they buy?? 

Please consider my feedback!

Thx"	positive
2529	1500564080	games	4	I really enjoy playing this game! When I saw the add I was excited to design and restore houses! To keep this quick, I‚Äôm just going to get into what I think this game needs. More furniture would be a good update! I feel like we just have to use the same furniture over and over! Maybe we could also be able to do apartments or hotels instead of always just a few rooms in a basic house.	positive
2530	1500564080	games	5	I love it so much but a lot of adds I have to turn my internet off so I can play it and I wish there were more to do like do plug in the tv when you place it screw things down and hook stuff up but if you have a add problem turn your internet off your phone and play turn back on when your done you‚Äôll love it ü•∞.	positive
2531	1500564080	games	4	I adore this game, but I have one big dislike about it... every time I do/restore something it takes me straight to an ad. When entering the game I click the room I want to restore then it takes me to an ad. I just want to be able to do a bit more before I get removed from the game itself and to a useless ad. But over all, I love the game, very well quality graphics, addicting, and FUN TO PLAY!!	positive
2532	1500564080	games	4	"I want to start out by saying I love this game. It is just so fun! It lets me fix floors, fix walls, clean appliances, furnish, and change neighborhoods. I definitely recommend this app. I only started playing this a few weeks ago and now, it‚Äôs one of my favorites.
But.....
There are just To. Many. Ads. It feels like after everything you do there is an ad. Please lower the amount of ads other then that it is great."	positive
2533	1500564080	games	4	This game is awesome, I can clean floors, clean windows, choose the flooring and furniture, fix walls and many more.  There is one problem there is too much ads! It would make sense to put a ad after every house you clean and furnish.  But after every action is outrageous, clean this couch,ad, fill in the wall, ad, paint the walls,ad, everything is advertisement!! I would‚Äôve given a 5 stars if it didn‚Äôt have so much ads!!!!	positive
2534	1500564080	games	1	This games relies insanely on ads. You can tell from the very first property they give you. To have the best furniture you have to watch (3) 30 second ads. They game isn‚Äôt very customizable as people would have you believe, everything cost money or ofcourse more ads. I highly recommend you don‚Äôt waste your time on this app as I did. It was literally the worst game I‚Äôve ever downloaded, usually I don‚Äôt even write reviews, but this game was so bad I didn‚Äôt want anyone else to go through that like I did. If there was a rating for less than 1 star I promise I‚Äôd give this game that.	negative
2535	1500564080	games	4	I love this game soo much. It‚Äôs one of my faves, but I don‚Äôt like how the luxury is furniture is free you just have to watch an ad. Well that is not the problem what I don‚Äôt like is almost all the time the ads are not a available at the time so I just spend my money from the game. I would have better sales if I used luxury so maybe you could just put a price in luxury instead of having an ad.	positive
2536	1500564080	games	4	I love the game idea and playing it. I spend so much time on the game every day. The only thing is that after every single thing I do I get an ad. I‚Äôve started putting my phone on airplane mode to stop the ads. Even tho I love it I say I don‚Äôt want to play a game with ads in it too much. In conclusion, I would recommend this game to a friend but give a warning that there are wayyy to many ads coming their way.	positive
2537	1500564080	games	2	The game itself is a lot of fun. It‚Äôs basically House Flipper but in quick form. You can repair walls, paint, sand floors, choose decor, and field offers from potential buyers. However, I‚Äôm deleting the app because of the relentless ads. At first, I was able to complete a house and then get an ad. But the further I progressed, the more ads I got. Now I get an ad after every single action I complete. Nothing turns me off of a game faster than a constant barrage of ads. An ad every five minutes or so I can tolerate. But not every thirty seconds.	positive
2538	1500564080	games	4	I love this game but there are a few problems for me  i want the game to get harder as I finish a certain amount of houses and there are a lot of ads every time I finish a house I need to watch an ad and it gets really annoying but this game is over all fun and I love I get to make over houses and design them the way I like  this game is good over all thank you for reading this	positive
2539	1500564080	games	2	The style is cute and it‚Äôs a clever little home renovation game, but there are too many ads between each action. Ads don‚Äôt usually bother me but it‚Äôs every other finished action. Just finished cleaning? Ad. Just finished adding furniture? Ad. Just finished painting? Ad. Finished selling? Ad. I get it‚Äôs a free game and you need ads for revenue but if you want people to continue playing the game you spent time making? Maybe take the ads down a notch so it‚Äôs actually playable and not a massive annoyance. Just a suggestion.	positive
2540	1500564080	games	5	I think this game is super fun although I just got it yesterday. It is short and quick but also addictive to keep playing. Next, I think you should take the designing to the next level to make it even better. You should also add the ability to design a full house instead of just one room.	positive
2541	1500564080	games	1	The only things you can do are fix floors, clean windows, and walls. You can‚Äôt actually choose how you want the room to look because you can only maybe fix the floor or one wall. You don‚Äôt have control over how you actually want anything to look. You can also not fix anything and people still bid on the house so nothing matters. Also every two seconds there‚Äôs adds, the same adds over and over. Make the game more customizable and the adds less repetitive and then it might be good.	positive
2542	1500564080	games	3	I like that you get to clean up and fix up things but an ad pops up too much even for me and I usually like ads as they tell you about other games. An ad after every thing you do is too much!!! If you make after every 3 things, then this will be worth continuing with but I‚Äôm already going to delete it in frustration. Maybe I‚Äôll download later and see if it‚Äôs any better.	positive
2543	1500564080	games	3	I enjoy this game, I really do, but it gets on my nerves just a little. I love the different floors, wall colors, and furniture but when I try to watch a video to get a luxury item, 80% of the time it‚Äôll say ‚Äúad not ready yet‚Äù or something. I though it was an internet problem at first. But then I started getting ads all the time! I don‚Äôt know what is happening. I hope whatever it is gets fixed soon. Great game otherwise! Keep it up.üëç	positive
2544	1500564080	games	2	"After doing one small task you get a 10 second ad. Then you can go back to the game; until you do another small task - which then is a two per task and the game is like ‚Äúoh hey, want another ad? Here ya go!‚Äù 

I understand this is a free game, and most of the revenue comes from those ads but if I can‚Äôt get through even just one task without getting interrupted by two ads (beginning of task, then after) what‚Äôs the point in the game? There‚Äôs basically no game and just ads."	positive
2545	1500564080	games	2	Most of the complaints are about the ads. I paid the $2.99 and just nixed the ads. Because well the ads were insane. I will say that I really liked the game but I‚Äôm on level 105 and I‚Äôm bored. I‚Äôve been bored. It‚Äôs the same tasks with the same furniture that don‚Äôt make sense. This is a very high rated game. You‚Äôd think they add some more projects the higher the level. If the difficulty doesn‚Äôt change then why have anything g that resembles a level?	negative
2546	1500564080	games	3	This game is fun but it needs to be changed. They should add more rooms not just kitchens, bathrooms etc. They should also let us customize everything and not just what was damaged. And more options for colors, wood, and furniture. It would also be cool to do a whole house not just a room. Lastly the adds are just way too much. You can‚Äôt even get through one room without three adds.	positive
2547	1500564080	games	3	Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love this game it‚Äôs very entertaining and fun to play but there is SO MANY ADS when ever I was about to clean something like a fridge an ad just had to pop up right when I was about to clean it. Another reason why it‚Äôs annoying some times is because it glitches a lot and is very annoying. But overall it‚Äôs a good game and very fun to play if there is nothing else to do :D	positive
2548	1500564080	games	4	I love this game now don‚Äôt get me wrong but there about two things that need to get fixed now the first thing is a very small thing that needs to get fixed and that is that when u out on the sauce on the pizza it misses one stop and that kinda bothered me. Second there is WAY too many ad like once I‚Äôm done with a pizza boom ad while I‚Äôm making the pizza BOOM ADS AFTER ADS	negative
2549	1500564080	games	5	This game is amazing! The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is that it has too many adds. It‚Äôs like, every time I finish doing ONE THING, there‚Äôs an add. I know that adds are how you make money from the game, but I would suggest to have less adds. It‚Äôs fine if you have some though.	positive
2550	623592465	games	1	I used to love this game. It was a weekly game night activity with my family. However, one day, the app would not even open before it crashed. So, as many people do when troubleshooting, I deleted and again downloaded the app. When downloading, it gave me the ‚Äòfamily download‚Äô message, and being the only option, I of course used it. When I opened the new app, I could not restore purchases because I ‚Äúdo not own the app.‚Äù I have tried everything I could, and having done so, I did what the app said and contacted them about the error. I have emailed probably around six times with no response in about a month. I have purchased 9 decks, some on one account and some from the phone I am trying to get them back on. I understand that they don‚Äôt family share, which is kind of dumb but not the issue. The issue is I spent money on decks to get on my phone. I cannot get them back and the ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù won‚Äôt even respond. I just want my decks back. I spent money on them and I am VERY disappointed in the app service department because they are NOT doing their job. IF YOU HAVE FAMILY SHARING DO NOT BUY DECKS OR YOU WILL LOSE YOUR MONEY	negative
2551	623592465	games	4	I LOVE LOVE LOOOVE this app! I have bought all the extra decks they have offered and tried to get all the free ones when they are offering them. Unfortunately this last time when I was trying to get the free Summertime by Halo Top deck it was not working and then it disappeared :( Also there is a deck that showed up one day that is purple with a yellow question mark. When I select that deck it freezes my app to where I have to completely quit out of the app and reload it to make it work again. I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else is dealing with the same issue? I LOVE this game with all my heart and my goal is to own all of the decks! The only reason why I did not give this app 5 stars is because of the disappearing decks. It makes me very sad when I miss out on a deck. üò≠ Other then that, I highly recommend this app because I doubt the missing decks doesn‚Äôt bother anyone else besides myself.	positive
2552	623592465	games	5	Me and my family are constantly bored and can never find a game we all agree on. Whenever we introduced something into the house one person always says something negative about it and we end up abandoning it. Yesterday when I purchased this game, I had to entice the whole family to even get together to play this game. When I finally succeed in doing so we tried out the accent card list and we immediately all agreed this was the best game ever! This game really brought our family together after 3 years of complete utter boredom! Thank you! I really recommend getting the game, it‚Äôs not only good for family but it‚Äôs also a great game to play with freinds!	positive
2553	623592465	games	3	"This is a fantastic game, very fun; however, the battery life usage is OFF the charts! I have had the app since yesterday and it's already in the last 24 hours has used 75% of my battery, with, get this, 1.1 HOURS on screen, with Audio! If this seems normal, my second most used app in the last 24 hours is Pinterest; I have used it for 1.3 hours on screen and only used up 9%!!! This app uses up battery WAY too fast. If you going to download the app I would ATLEAST recommend using it on an iPad Air or iPad Pro. (Something that actually has the battery power for this game.) An iPhone is NOT powerful enough for this. (I use an iPhone 6.)

I hope you heed my warnings when you choose to download this."	positive
2554	623592465	games	4	"This is a fantastic game! A pull-out-whenever-and-have-fun-with-family-and-friends kind of game.  Everything looks and sounds very polished.

A couple suggestions that would make the experience even better for me:
- it would be great to be able to archive the sets I have not yet purchased and do not want to purchase in the future. Tired of seeing the pretty little liars deck for example that I know I will never purchase.
- would be great if the user could customize the UI a bit. For example it would be cool if I could turn the Christmas theme off, or turn it back on in late October if I‚Äôm in the Christmas mood."	positive
2555	623592465	games	4	After playing it for two nights straight with the same people, we‚Äôve been through all the free decks and can easily give clues to achieve correct guesses. Gets boring quickly. Now of course, there are lots of other decks that can be purchased, but for .99¬¢ each and with no option to just purchase all decks for a ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù rate, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be playing for much longer unless something changes. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, we had lots of fun the first night, but come on. Had to purchase the app and now I‚Äôm supposed to purchase each add-on as well. Sorry Ellen. Im not that rich. Wanna help us out?	positive
2556	623592465	games	4	"I love this game and its very addictive.i am a social worker in the foster care field and to alleviate our day my colleagues and I spend our lunch time playing this game. This definitely gives us a good laugh after  stressful events. My only issue with app is that on my iPad once ""it's times up"" it automatically kicks me off the game which is very annoying. I have been using my iPhone but the iPad is better for the amount of people that are playing. Another issue the purchases don't sync the same in me iPad or iPhone don't know why. I hope this issue can be fixed. Other than that its an amazing game."	positive
2557	623592465	games	5	I‚Äôll start by saying my spouse and I LIVE (went to type love, autocorrected to live, that also works, I‚Äôm going with it) this game, and we were super stoked to have the 90 second time limit! My suggestion would be to have the option to have a longer time limit...I‚Äôm absolutely certain that a chunk of your users smoke marijuana (legally, of course.....üòë), and to be honest, the longer time limit is pretty darn necessary.  I (I mean they...) would probably pay for it in an in app purchase, $1.99 sounds pretty good, just sayin‚Äô	positive
2558	623592465	games	1	I‚Äôve purchased many MANY decks over the years. I‚Äôve tried downloading/redownloading & ‚ÄúRestoring My Deck Purchases‚Äù countless times on the App but nearly all my purchased decks are gone. They dissappeared, were wiped clean. The only option is to keep re-buying everything I‚Äôve already paid for over & over to get it to stick. I‚Äôve tried emailing Head‚Äôs Up App support numerous times w/ no response. They can continue to add new seasonal decks & do updates but they don‚Äôt have the decency to reply to paying customers who‚Äôve helped contribute to this game‚Äôs profittable success. Can someone from support please kindly contact me!? I just want the game decks I paid for back (I have my iTunes receipt emails as proof!). Thank you.	positive
2559	623592465	games	1	"I purchased this app for my son in order for him to play with his friends as well as our family when waiting in various lines.  It is rather annoying to have to buy additional decks, but I was shocked when I found out that the decks cannot be accessed by my own family members on their respective phones.  I had downloaded the Harry Potter, Marvel bundle and Star Wars decks onto my phone with the reasonable expectation that my wife, son and daughter would be able to use them as well.  

It is understandable that Ellen DeGeneres would want to make money, but it is terribly petty and unbecoming to be this greedy.  As I stated above, it is reasonable to charge money for specialty decks, but unscrupulous to not be transparent wherein these decks cannot be shared whilst the actual app can be shared."	negative
2560	623592465	games	4	I just recently bought the game and personally I think it is amazing. I bought a few of the packs and one of them was the write your own deck. It was working well but when we started to play after we got the word it wouldn‚Äôt go to the next card it was stuck on that card and we couldn‚Äôt get it to go to the next. That needs to be fixed whenever you can or we just do t know how to play heheh. Other than that amazing game I‚Äôd recommend this to everyone I know but pls fixed this asap or I would like a refund	positive
2561	623592465	games	4	This game is soooo much fun and it‚Äôs great for playing with friends, there is only one drawback to the costume decks (which are ¬¢99 each), there is no way to reset them! I have bought 3 costume decks already and created about 600+ cards on each but they‚Äôve gotten boring since they‚Äôre quite old, and the only way to reset them is to swipe left on each card which would take forever. I just hope they add a costume deck reset button because it would be very useful and would compensate better the ¬¢99 we pay for each.	positive
2562	623592465	games	4	All is great in this game except the 1 minute limit on the game. I wish it was something you can alter, as in one minute you get only few answers. Especially if you take a deck where you have to act it out without words. That takes longer and the game is over after just a few questions. Also the one we play with kids. Same thing. They need more time to think about it and get really upset that it‚Äôs over so soon. It discourages then and they don‚Äôt feel like playing again cuz they feel like failures.	positive
2563	623592465	games	5	I've had this app on my phone for 2 years now and have had lots of fun playing it w/family & friends. I've used it while waiting in line for concerts and it definitely makes the time fly in a very enjoyable way. The only problem I'm now experiencing is the inability to make my own cards. I've enjoyed that feature a lot and have written to the developers for help, but I have yet to hear from them. I will update this review when/if this problem is taken care of.	positive
2564	623592465	games	4	This game is really a lot of fun and it‚Äôs easy for families to play anywhere at anytime as long as you have your phone,table,laptop or whatever your may be playing on. I saw a lot of people saying that it‚Äôs a rip off or it‚Äôs not fun and boring, but my family gets bored of games quickly, but we have been playing ‚ÄúHeads Up‚Äù for over 3 months now and we‚Äôre not bored! I do have one suggestion for you, if maybe you could make some more topics like celebrities and popular shoes\clothing brands. Thank you guys so much for making such a fun game!	positive
2565	623592465	games	5	I like this game because it is where if it is game night or something like that it is where you and your family can play it is like one person has the phone on there four head and then the other people have to acted it out then with the person who has the phone and if they did not get it right then it is on to the nexts persons turn also if you get one right you would put your face down then put it back up.	positive
2566	623592465	games	3	Ok say my Moms friends birthday was coming up so we had a party we were thinking fun games to play so my mom got the app and this is where it all started going down hill so we discussed to get the karaoke pack it was 1.99 so my mom said what the heck sure she bought and it was all songs that nobody knew so then we saw an Avengers one so we were like ohh okay so my mom but it for 3.99 and some of the questions was from D.C sand some of them didn‚Äôt even make sense so I wrote review to just tell y‚Äôall don‚Äôt buy and of the packs unless you like not common songs. P.s the game branded is amazing on the app and it‚Äôs free.	positive
2567	623592465	games	4	Ok there is just a few things to adjust for one I‚Äôm a kid so I can only pretty much play the animal one ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and I‚Äôm not buying the kid one because that one is just meh. So maybe add another version and also i would like to be able to set the amount of time and adjust some things but overall if you don‚Äôt have anything to do and you want to kill time with friends then buy this. It still is great even without my recommendations  because I play this when waiting for lines in six flags and it is just perfect.	positive
2568	623592465	games	1	I first downloaded this game 6 months ago, and my boyfriend and I loved it. I wound up deleting it because we stopped using it as often, and just recently brought it back. I had purchased several decks and now they won't re download. Also, the constant ads before each round are ridiculous. Having to sit through a 30 second ad every time I play a round led me to just deleting the app again. Also, since it won't let me re download my decks, we've just been playing the free rounds, and more than a couple times I've sat through the ad, and then the app dies. When I bring it back, it says I already used my free round. Overall, very unhappy with how it's changed	positive
2569	623592465	games	5	"This is a very great game and when I played it with my friends and family, we were all cracking UP!!!

And also when I wanna do another deck, you have to pay. I‚Äôm not getting mad or frustrated, it‚Äôs just I wanna play the decks that you need to buy that you won‚Äôt get to play. thank you for listening inventor of this app.

2572	623592465	games	1	I bought this app awhile ago and didn‚Äôt have any problems with it. I just downloaded it again (had removed it off my old phone awhile back) and for some reason, keep getting an ‚ÄúSKERROR DOMAIN‚Äù message whenever I want to restore my purchases or try to download a free deck. I‚Äôve tried deleting and re-downloading the app itself throughout the day but I still get the same message. It says to contact them if it keeps happening but the developer website link just goes to the ellentube page??? I didn‚Äôt see anything about how to connect with someone other than to appear on the show, etc. Does anyone know how to fix this?	positive
2573	623592465	games	2	I played this game when it first came out, it was an awesome family game and we had a lot of fun playing it. After a while the limited amount of cards got boring and repetitive, sadly the content included in the price feels more like a free to play game not a game you actually have to buy. It‚Äôs extremely annoying to want to play but have to purchase everything separately. There are plenty of apps like this one that are almost exactly the same but include more content and allow you to unlock other packs without paying money, and those apps are free.	positive
2574	623592465	games	3	I played this game when it first came out and it was a fun, and the new packs have definitely made it even better. I also love that you can play a free round of a pack you don‚Äôt own if you watch an ad, but every time the ad ends, the app shuts down, and the option for a free round is no longer available for that pack so I just have to buy the pack to know how it is. Hope this gets fixed and I somehow get my free rounds back because I never got to play them. For that I have to take off two stars	positive
2575	623592465	games	2	My family and I play this game all the time together and never had an issue. That is until I upgraded my phone. It says that you can restore all of the packs you purchase in the app but that is not entirely true. You can only restore the individual ones you purchase. If you purchase one of their sale pack sets you will not restore those. I have emailed support numerous time and there has been 0 response. If you are going to buy things in this game make sure you buy each one individually so that you don‚Äôt have this problem.	positive
2576	623592465	games	5	We have such a great time playing. There is a deck for everyone including each of our favorite shows. We play at dinner, we play at Disneyland while in line, we play for family game night. It‚Äôs so much fun and we always look for new decks. And for just adults it‚Äôs fun to see us all try to guess, just add alcohol and the silliness quadruples. Get this app, you won‚Äôt regret it.	positive
2577	623592465	games	4	Love the game.  Tons of free content if you pay attention.  Would leave as five stars but I have to remove half a star since my Transformers Deck was removed (and i guess i have to round up since there are no half stars).  Last time I was in the game, my Bumblebee deck ‚ÄúDynamic Duos‚Äù was glitched and wouldn‚Äôt open.  It was off to the side at the bottom of my archive and I couldn‚Äôt move it.  Now it is missing.  Was this deck removed from everyone that had it in their collection?	negative
2578	623592465	games	3	I like this game but the biggest problem I have with it is just how hard it is to play with people who aren't just millennials or super on top of current entertainment and stuff. So few decks can be played by a wide spread of generations. Ive played with teenagers and they don't get most of the references. And Ive played with my parents and they don't get all the other references. Its too ‚Äúpop culture-ey‚Äù.... I wish there were more decks that could be topics everyone might know... like more educational decks or something like that.	positive
2579	623592465	games	5	I just downloaded this app and I love it so much! My cousin was just visiting for 2 weeks and when we were bored we would just play this. It comes with a good amount of free decks and the ones that aren‚Äôt free are only 99 cents. I do have a suggestion for a new deck though. You could make one of the greatest showman. It would be so fun to try to act out and guess the scenes. So everyone that reads this... download this app!	positive
2580	623592465	games	3	A nice game but what annoys me is that you have to pay for like all of the categories! You already have to pay a dollar for the game do they really think that I am going to spend another ten dollars to get what seven more categories?!? It is really frustrating because when you first get the game you only get nine sets to choose from and the only way to get more is to pay. It is a good game and enjoy playing in but am constantly annoyed with the fact that I will only be able to play certain ones	positive
2581	623592465	games	5	Great game for kids and kids in their family they have fun with their own food and they will have to complete their work for me and I will have them come back and get them done for sure thanks again and have fun coming here again thanks buddy for coming back in town and for me to pick them I‚Äôll pay to pick him up for lunch thanks buddy thanks again thanks for coming	positive
2582	623592465	games	3	"My family and I have loved playing Heads Up but I was a little annoyed to see that the app had bundled a lot of the games.  So the games that were already downloaded were gone.  Many of the games I had already purchased were now bundled and I had to purchase them again!  

The developer should‚Äôve allowed previous purchases to remain and also have provided  bundled offers.  Now I have purchased some titles twice but will not purchase more.  This is a money grab!"	negative
2583	623592465	games	3	I use this game when we have some extra time to kill and it‚Äôs always a hit. Recently I bought a custom deck and added a long list. But now if I scroll through the list I accidentally delete items from the list. It says to to swipe left to delete, but the slightest touch on the left of the item and suddenly it‚Äôs gone, with no way to recover or even to know what it was so I could add it back. I‚Äôd give it a 5-star except for that.	negative
2584	623592465	games	4	SUPER FUN AND ADDICTING GAME! My only concern is with the weekly changing mystery deck. I have had the same mystery deck for over a month know and don‚Äôt get me wrong I LOVE branded it is actually my favorite deck but I would love to try some new ones. Please let me know if I miss understood what the ‚Äúmystery deck‚Äù does and I will be happy to give y‚Äôall 5 stars! If I was correct I hope you are able to fix it! Again love this game...I just want it to be the best, most functional, and fun it can be! Thanks!	positive
2585	623592465	games	3	"Love it! I would give this app 5 stars if I could ignore the battery drainage. 
As with others, it is a great way to pass the time. 
The only problem is that it absolutely eats up your battery. I played it for 50 mins yesterday with over 60% battery to begin. My iPhone 7 got extremely hot and shut off bc the game used all of my battery power.
This is the only app on my phone that does this and I use Facebook regularly. 
It would be great if there was some improvement in this."	positive
2586	623592465	games	1	"This game would be great if free. However, it isn‚Äôt free, and the algorithms are very poor. While playing we frequently had entire sections repeat and a very limited number of themes to choose from ‚Äî of course, more were available for extra fees. 

As is, if you‚Äôre having a customer pay for an app, it would be great to have more themes available OR more choice options/better algorithms so games don‚Äôt repeat. The app is only useful to play for about 20 minutes with the available features. Even though the game is $1, this version really should be free based on its current quality."	positive
2587	623592465	games	3	Although the game is super fun and exciting, unfortunately almost every game gets stuck on the ‚ÄúPass‚Äù screen when we pass and runs down our time from whatever time was left. For example if we had 40 seconds left the Pass screen stays put until the 40 seconds run off. Initially I thought it was a penalty for passing but then I realized this was almost every game were a question was passed. It truly interrupts the momentum and any possible achievements.	positive
2588	623592465	games	1	I purchased Heads Up for .99 and the additional categories for 4.99. However, the app is not working and every time I try to open it, the screen turns black and I get kicked out of the app. I deleted it and installed it again, only to find that the additional categories were missing and had to be purchased a second time. I then reinstalled and repurchased the app and the additional categories, only for the same thing to happen again. I emailed the app developer a week ago but haven‚Äôt received a response. So frustrated and disappointed!! Wasted $11!!!	negative
2589	623592465	games	4	"Since the new update the game is freezing at the times up screen. I have tried restarting my phone and restarting the app multiple times. I have enjoyed this game for years now and hope this can be fixed.

Just had another update and the same issues freezing at the times up screen. Please make sure that stops happening after updates."	positive
2590	623592465	games	5	This is a good app to play when you‚Äôre waiting in a long line for something, cause it will help pass the time! I saw people play this game while waiting for a ride in Cedar Point! This really helped pass the time because one ride broke down for an hour! So, I‚Äôm giving this game five stars because of this. I mean, how could you not play it?	positive
2591	623592465	games	1	"I heard about the new mystery deck where it chooses a random deck and it‚Äôs a new deck every week. I have checked every week but for the past 2 or 3 weeks, the mystery deck is still the F‚Ä¢R‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢E‚Ä¢N‚Ä¢D‚Ä¢S deck. I don‚Äôt even watch that show. Please change the mystery deck every week. It‚Äôs getting on my nerves to still see F‚Ä¢R‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢E‚Ä¢N‚Ä¢D‚Ä¢S as the mystery deck every day.

Update: It‚Äôs May 2019 and the mystery is still F‚Ä¢R‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢E‚Ä¢N‚Ä¢D‚Ä¢S! I don‚Äôt understand why they are too lazy to change it. It may be glitch or something on my phone because I do have an old iPhone 6SE but that mystery deck needs to changed. I don‚Äôt watch F‚Ä¢R‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢E‚Ä¢N‚Ä¢D‚Ä¢S so don‚Äôt expect me to do that deck."	negative
2592	623592465	games	5	I bought this as a drinking game for my girlfriend and I when we were bored or entertaining guests. It has turned out to be one of the funnest games we've ever played. I really like the free deck. I got the Star Wars force awakens deck as my gift. Congratulations heads up on 1 billion decks sold and I hope you sell 1 billion more. Or was it 1 million? I can't remember either way congratulations	positive
2593	623592465	games	5	This is definitely a great game night game especially when everyone playing gets really into it! It was also great to play with the kids who were learning English (even though they didn't always know what everything was) I would definitely recommend if you like to have fun with friends!	positive
2594	623592465	games	1	This app has been nothing but trouble for me and I would like attention brought to this. I purchased your holiday bundle and my app has been laggy ever since. I have reported this issue and have gotten no feedback. I started searching to see if I could resolve the issue my self and your site said to delete the app and reinstall it to probably fix some problems. When I reinstalled it my holiday bundle is not there. I have proof I did purchase the holiday bundle. PLEASE help me fix this or at least give me a refund for the holiday bundle and the app I purchased. I AM VERY UNSATISFIED WITH THIS!!	positive
2595	623592465	games	1	The app keeps freezing on the ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs Up‚Äù screen. The only way to get the ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs Up‚Äù screen to go away is to close the app and reopen it, which definitely puts a damper on game play. I‚Äôve tried restarting my phone, checked for all updates including my phone software, and deleting and redownloading the app, none of which has fixed this problem. My mom and I love playing this game while we wait in line rides at Disney World so it‚Äôs very disappointing that it‚Äôs currently having this problem. When the app is working, it‚Äôs great!	positive
2596	623592465	games	5	It used to be free but I‚Äôm assuming that there are more games and more categories on this amazing app. I rate this app a 100 out of 10 . Besides 99‚Ç¨ isn‚Äôt even that much I love it soo much I play it almost every day . I love it soooooooo much I recommend it to everyone who wants to play a fun family game at game night or when your bored!!!	positive
2597	623592465	games	4	I enjoy playing this game but it is bonkers that it won‚Äôt restore the Disney parks deck, when you received it by checking in at park, when you get a new phone. I don‚Äôt have a trip planned anytime soon and am not about to drop 3 dollars on a deck I already owned. When I hit restore purchases it doesn‚Äôt restore that one. This was the deck I played the most so I‚Äôm very disappointed	positive
2598	623592465	games	5	Heads-up is the perfect game for kids or even the family when your traveling, family game night, or even waiting in line at a theme park. Yes, my family and I did play while waiting in line and it was fun, we weren‚Äôt complaining about our feet hurting or being hungry either. It‚Äôs a good laugh and family friendly.	positive
2599	623592465	games	4	I love this game! It‚Äôs a lot of fun to play with my family but we end up having to pass a lot because me and my brother don‚Äôt often know all of the things. If I‚Äôm remembering correctly this game used to have a lot of kid packs. It could use an update with new, free packs such as 2000 celebs, guess the lullaby could be fun, 2000 movies, etc.  The animal pack, and the acting ones are our favorites so far.	positive
2600	406889139	games	5	I love this game a lot and when started playing it I just loved it more and more but the more I played it I felt like the spins are rigged in a way or I feel like i just get unlucky every time but then I notice it happens every time to where if there is something going on and you can get a Raid or an attack and get 2 for per a hit attack and 3 for a block and then 4 for a raid and 5 for a perfect and it‚Äôs X‚Äôs what ever you bet soon as you get both it‚Äôs like impossible to get another one of either I was betting X10 and had 1200 spins from the tournament I won and I only got I believe two attacks and one raid out of all the spins and I understand it‚Äôs probably set up a way but I feel like if stuff like that happens it makes the game not as fun because you put in the time to get all theses spins but when you use them you barley get anything and then the second thing is when your playing and say I have 55 spins and and I‚Äôm betting 30 then I don‚Äôt win any thing so now I have 25 spins every thing to get more spins pops up and it does it every time and it get frustrating when you just wanna play I would understand if it did it when you completely run out but every time is just over kill and also makes me not as interested in play as much but besides the two things I love the game and I feel like if it weren‚Äôt for these things it be by far my favorite game	positive
2601	406889139	games	3	If you can overcome the frustration of the constant repetitive, loud, pop up notifications within each opening of the app, zeroing out spins or coins, or at any possible point they can sneak one in- it‚Äôs the sort of game that keeps you coming back to throughout the day and has interesting challenges that rotate on a regular basis keeping it challenging and fun. Just enough strategy needed to keep me hooked and just enough opportunity to take some harmless revenge out on siblings and cousins who I am not around enough to pick on like I can with repeated attacks and raids. Love ya sis but you better not let your guard down!! For the developers -Please, please, please - find a way to minimize the number of pop up screens!!  Their repetitive nature is only motivating to keep the app closed, not purchase a package. I hate to run out of spins, not because they are gone but because the punishment is between two and six pop ups every single time. That‚Äôs overkill on the marketing. I will happily read through a screen of messages once daily and am fully aware of all the options for buying, earning or sharing more spins. You are beating a dead horse and it‚Äôs gonna be what ultimately will lose my business. My other favorite game keeps a screen available of all that pertinent information available at all times on a list in an INBOX. It doesn‚Äôt require me close a hundred screens a day to get to the fun part. It‚Äôs a much preferable option. Thanks	positive
2602	406889139	games	3	I like the game, gets addicting but after a while it is ridiculous. Ads are WAY, WAY too many. You would think that after a purchase of a pack or whatever, you would have less or no ads at all? Nope, ads just continue and get worse in frequency to the point that it isn‚Äôt even fun because I‚Äôm closing ads more than playing. 1hr wait for 5 spins is a little ridiculous, maybe like 30minutes but an hour is way too long. Contests seem to be rigged or something because a contest can like JUST start and two or three players will be well over the any rational number, like 200+. However even with over 500 spins, doing 3 or 5x per spin, I may get three or five of the Thor Hammer/helmet or whatever is the required prize to get the contests stuff so how others have enough spins to get well over like 1000, even betting more than 5 spins is ridiculous. On top of it, it seems that it is rigged because during non-tournament things, I get a massive amount of attacks with little addition of more spins/raids/etc. however, like the tournament that is on now, some guy has like 10k+ emeralds and no matter what I spin, I‚Äôm not getting any attacks? I had 1000 spins from the last tournament and out of that 1000 spins, I got five attacks. I was doing the 5x bet through the whole thing too! It‚Äôs getting ridiculous and it seems that the more you play, the more you‚Äôre going to pay to keep playing!	positive
2603	406889139	games	5	My thing is that I have a problem I absolutely don‚Äôt have a friend playing the game üòû I have try to get them to join but they don‚Äôt play games like I do  . I love the game but it is getting real hard for me right now because I have just took the extra cards I have had & just trade them into the game for extra coins or spins!! Spins r the most important things to me I cannot get the spins. I have with on the game page things and try so I could get spins because I need them , but I was asking about what to  on do on here they was a couple of them thinking I was trying to lie about not knowing all about it they was saying that I was a was a spam what so I just when out of the page I didn‚Äôt think ü§î it was funny at all !! So I have been trying to get signed into it right with out help & not asking nobody on there . I will get it worked out & I‚Äôm going to show those who didn‚Äôt believe me about not knowing  about where I could get spins on your page they will see . Also my grandson I take to school and go pick him up he has my phone a lot when he is here . I love the game because I‚Äôm still here!!!!

2604	406889139	games	2	Recently I have been going through my bank stuff, wondering where my budget could have been off, and noticed many, and I mean MANY double charges, and sometimes even triple charges.. VERY FRUSTRATING. I love this game, and still play it! This game has all the intricacies to be something great! A casino slot style interface with the addictive village building, upgrade platform. I loved this game when I first started playing! But as I progressed I realized that the game is rigged to be a cash cow for the developers. I will try to keep this short, although I have many things I‚Äôd like to say. 5 spins an hour? Absolutely rediculous.. Gold cards? Try trading them. Literally impossible unless they unlock two, that‚Äôs right, two cards to be traded. This only happens once a weekend, or even every other weekend. Out of spins and have some extra real money to throw at them? Don‚Äôt worry, the slot machine becomes even more rigged when you were playing with the spins the game provides. The reels will be sure to literally land on the same 5 things and you‚Äôll maybe receive one ‚Äúraid‚Äù, ‚Äúattack‚Äù, or any other objective in the game. Also, if you have a complaint about something that has happened in the game, for instance, I had thousands of spins disappear one day when I multitasked to another application, they will not provide any response, compensation, explanation, or even a breath in your direction.	negative
2605	406889139	games	3	"I‚Äôm 50/50 on this game I enjoy playing coin master but, it‚Äôs a game that was created to attack your friends which some take too seriously , it becomes a competition. It‚Äôs very competitive and frustrating. My issue is that they don‚Äôt raise the daily spin amount based on the level you are on which is ridiculous when you have amounts in your village that costs close to 1 billion for a PIECE OF IT and while you spin the wheel you risk someone raiding you because you‚Äôre not protected but desperate to spin that wheel regardless hoping for a huge amount to fulfill whatever earning you made for that one piece of the village. 
Another complaint is the actual spins - what the hell???? How do expect us to choose your options of 10x20x30x40x50 x100x200 with 60 spins? If you as an app developer cared about the ones that are actually playing your game for WHILE and want to keep us playing RAISE THE SPINS BASED ON LEVELS  - I don‚Äôt get it!!!!!!! 
You do it for the XP‚Äôs (the higher the XP‚Äôs the higher the  percentage of winnings) Do it for the spins as well....it‚Äôs only logical. You took over a year to add 2 more attack shields and you‚Äôve seen a hike of the amount of people who are playing now. BASICALLY RAISE THE BAR BASED ON LEVELS FOR ALL CATEGORIES. 

And please don‚Äôt reply by telling me to call or reach out to a department. Just send the message to the developer and make this happen."	positive
2606	406889139	games	2	"I enjoy playing this game and am around village 20+ so I've played for a bit of time. This game will spam the crap out of you with purchase prompts, ads and more. I'll breakdown the spam here: Load game- get attacked with 2 event pop ups and a package pop up. While playing, your screen may get a random ad out of nowhere you'll need to close (4 pop ups so far). Now while doing your spins if you dare increase bet past 1 and your spins is not evenly divisible by your bet (spin 2x for 11 spins, this happens at 1 spin left while spinning at 2x), the game will give you 3 pop ups, one to buy more spins, then a package, then a prompt to watch and add for A SINGLE spin. But if you got to this point by not doing 1 spin, you have probably 1 or 2 spins left, you need to use them so when you run out, now you get THREE MORE POPUPS!! This totals 10 pop ups.

For the issue of this game: Cards are massively flawed. I have like 12 sets I have not fully collected, yet ever super rare chest (you barely get them besides upgrading village) I receive literally the same card duplicate. I have over 5 copies of the same card when there are over 10 more 1 stars I could get that I don't have!!! Nope here is a duplicate! If you play, an event to trade duplicates for chests to get cards appear but if you do this, you simply removed your 5 copies to get 1 of the same copy because the randomness is not random for cards!!"	positive
2607	406889139	games	2	"As I got to higher levels in the game, (I‚Äôm on 30) it seems that the shields to protect my even more expensive villages, are harder to get! Each item for the village is more expensive, but it‚Äôs next to impossible to earn enough to pay for them because you are constantly being raided. I‚Äôve paid for ‚Äúsnacks‚Äù to keep my two low level pets ‚Äúworking‚Äù and I‚Äôve had little protection from attacks. And by the way, I really don‚Äôt want to attack my FB friends. That‚Äôs a great way to lose real friends!!
Then there‚Äôs the whole ‚Äúcard collection‚Äù ridiculousness. I now have EIGHT sets of cards, where all I need is a gold card. Most of them, only ONE card! You cannot be gifted gold cards from anyone, you have to find them. They had some sort of a gold card exchange, but those two were cards I had neither of. Didn‚Äôt help me ONE bit. I‚Äôve spun for coins and ‚Äúbought‚Äù chests, even bought the magical chests when I won extra coins, but the cards in them are the same low level junk that I‚Äôve been getting since the first level. If I keep buying chests, I have no village. With no village, I earn no stars for my pets, etc. Whatever the developers did to tighten up the wheel when they crashed a week or so ago, it seems to have effected the ability to get shields. And the whole ‚Äúmultiplier‚Äù of spins to win jackpots ALL the time, has gotten REALLY, REALLY old. I‚Äôm soooo ready to delete this AP!!"	positive
2608	406889139	games	3	The concept of the game is fun but the way the game is created you will not get very far in the game. I don‚Äôt understand why you would make the game that way it makes your players lose interest. Spinning you can have full 50 spins and still won‚Äôt get a shield, raid or attack. This happens for days. Next issue when building your village it‚Äôs hard to complete when you have to fix an item multiple times after it was completed because you keep getting attacked. It will be really great if once an item is completed that item can not be hit. Maybe add ‚ÄúMiss Attack‚Äù option for picking an item that was completed and the reward can be the amount of Blocked Attack. Another BIG ISSUE is the cards. What‚Äôs the point of still getting cards from sets that you have already completed, you can‚Äôt get the rewards twice. If the set is completed you should not continue to get those same cards. For Gold Card event why all gold cards are not trade able. Again you can only use 1 card for your set what‚Äôs the point of having 15+ of the same card. I really hope you start listening to your game players and all that I have said has been a problem for most players. There are many villages to complete so those few changes will not stop players from playing I‚Äôm sure you will get players back.	positive
2609	406889139	games	5	This game is the free simple wheel spinning game, but the graphics and bonuses keep it very exciting. I play and keep up with the fan Facebook page several times a day. The Fb page is a nice way to grab free gifts. I also like this new daily gift thing. The daily bonus wheel is a jerk around. The levels are so detailed and visual nice to watch as I level up.  I do spend money on some of the packages from time to time as a well worth it gift to myself.  I enjoy looking at the leader board to watch my friends progress, and the map of knowing what‚Äôs up next. I also like being able to send gifts to multiple ppl and not just one at a time. I‚Äôm really not a fan of the card bonus feature because completing a set is so far and few in between its kinda a waste of space, plus they take away from perfect raids. I‚Äôve been paying for months, on the card Fb page, spend money on packages, and buy chest with spare coins and I‚Äôm only 4 or so completed sets in. The quest feature is dull as well, I go there to loose coins so others won‚Äôt get them in a raid or to get a couple breathe minutes where I won‚Äôt get raided. Other than that this game rocks and the other version of this style of game does not compare.	positive
2610	406889139	games	1	Getting more a more frustrated with this game. Customer service repeats the FAQ to you in all of their replies instead of actually looking into the problem you‚Äôre having. I have gone back and forth with them 3 times about not receiving spins when a friend joined the game through my link (YES, he did all the steps in one sitting like I have reiterated over and over) and I get the same automated looking message just outlining the steps he needed to have taken for me to get the spins with no actual help. The daily wheel spin almost always never works for me, it‚Äôll get stuck between two numbers and I don‚Äôt get any money out of it. And the game always loses connection while I‚Äôm doing a spin and it takes those spins and doesn‚Äôt give them back to me when it reconnects! I can never play on WiFi, doesn‚Äôt matter where I am or what WiFi I am on, it always loses connection midway through playing and steals my spins‚Äî or I‚Äôll be raiding someone‚Äôs village and it‚Äôll dig forever and then take me back to the home screen without getting any coins. I‚Äôm almost to level 100 and it‚Äôs getting too difficult to advance to new levels, the amount of money needed is insane and the amount of spins and rewards given don‚Äôt reflect that. I have someone raid my village every time I‚Äôm in the middle of spinning trying to get something crazy like 200 million for one village piece.	negative
2611	406889139	games	5	"Up until this past week I would have given this game 5 stars! But things change when you get cheated out of coins and spins. Twice this week now. I was first cheated out of spins. I won 1500 spins from one of the either attacks or raids, can‚Äôt remember which one. Well, I was continuing to play and had to go do a couple of things and was not able to get back to the game until the next morning, I still had about 800 spins left when I stopped and when I came back the next morning they were all gone! All I had was the 50 spins you get. That was very upsetting I haven‚Äôt seen anywhere that I know of where it says that you lose your spins if you don‚Äôt use them the same day! 

The second thing was today, I did a raid and stole about $6,000,000+ coins and I had been betting 5 with my spins so that $6,000,000+ should have been multiplied by 5. That was not the case and as a matter of fact, I didn‚Äôt get any coins at all!! 

For these reasons I‚Äôm really starting to dislike this game!!! Prior to this, like I said, I would have given it 5 starts. I have spent a lot of time and money playing it to be cheated out of my coins and spins like that!!! üò°"	negative

I question whether the slot machine is truly random or if the game keeps an eye on where you are in the game and intentionally holds you short of achieving goals in an attempt to get you to purchase more coins.
I guess it is fun, just to keep you busy doing something, like while waiting for the state workers at the DMV. 
After playing this game for several months now, it is strangely satisfying in the sense that you can play it without having to concentrate and I agree with my earlier evaluation that it is something to do when you find yourself somewhere that you don‚Äôt want to be.  I did notice that the response from a game support person to another review that stated they felt the spins were not random. The game support responded and apologized that the person felt that way, lol!  It is my favorite thing to say to people that are upset with me for something I said or did and I do not feel an apology is necessary.  I merely say, I‚Äôm sorry that you feel that way, and the person usually fakes it as an apology, when it is nothing of the kind. I take the game support‚Äôs response as an admission that they have an algorithm that does affect the spin‚Äôs outcome."	positive
2613	406889139	games	5	I actually really love this game I play pretty much everyday, I‚Äôve even purchased a few spins before but, yesterday for some odd reason I had made it to collect my 600 spins even had millions in coins and then the game froze. I thought it was my phone at first so I shut my phone off and turned it back on went back to the game and I didn‚Äôt have my 600 spins are coins. I just chalked it up as being my phone fault but it happen again last night it wasn‚Äôt as many spins are coins but still I didn‚Äôt get what I won. Another thing why do you place these offers on FB that all you have to do is like, share and comment and you can receive spins but in order to get those spins you have to complete a survey are get whatever that‚Äôs not fair if I‚Äôve done what you‚Äôve asked as far as the like share and comment then I should just be able to get the spins. Like I said I love the game but it need just a few bugs worked out and I won‚Äôt be sharing are commenting on fb cause I really don‚Äôt feel like I should have to complete a whole extra survey to get spins I‚Äôll just wait on the ones to fill back up. Thank you!	positive
2614	406889139	games	2	"I enjoy the game but out of 50 spins at least 5-7 don‚Äôt pay out and I have had raids and revenge attacks that don‚Äôt pay either, it also didn‚Äôt pay out my snack either.   At first it only happening only 1-2 times but it‚Äôs ruining the game.  It‚Äôs sad because before this I played all the time, now I only play 2 times a day to ‚Äúeat up‚Äù my spins and see what damage has been done to my village. Is this the was it‚Äôs setup that some spins don‚Äôt pay out the further up you go?  
You should be able to purchase pet snacks. Since I have been playing I have only gotten them 3 times. I realize you need the revenue and getting people to pay for such items is necessary but make the available maybe a little more often ‚Äúspecial‚Äù the chest or when you raid. Offer them in a special once in a while on spins for 1 hour make them 2 hour snacks. Offer them in the ballon pops in 15 minute increments.  The villages are so expensive as you go further up the line too.  I understand that it should be harder the further you go but the cost is exorbitant. There should be a trade off for getting that far, the expense, being able to protect your village. Maybe offer additional spins or shields in exchange for added cost or having to meet some challenge. Just a thought."	negative
2615	406889139	games	2	I only got this game because of another app I have. It has it‚Äôs times when it‚Äôs frustrating because I don‚Äôt get shields and I‚Äôm close to finishing my village but then I get attacked until I don‚Äôt have much of a village left so now I have to build it back up again, which usually takes days if not weeks. Now to make matters worse, I was gifted over 100 spins by the app and about 20 million coins (which had never happened to me before). After getting through a few spins and accumulating over 90 million coins, my game has been frozen for 4 days straight. I can get the annoying ads off the screen but I can‚Äôt click anything on the actual game screen. I‚Äôm trying to prevent deleting this app but if the game is going to be frozen, I will delete it and I will not get it back because when I finally get a good amount of coins and spins, I‚Äôm just going to think the same thing will happen, so I hope you fix things soon or I will not be playing the game anymore. And I‚Äôve checked millions of times to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss an update for the game and I didn‚Äôt, so if you do decide to respond to me please don‚Äôt say that because it is updated to the most current version. Don‚Äôt tell me to go to the help center either because I can‚Äôt get to it at all.	positive
2616	406889139	games	1	The game is a good time killer and bank account depleter. I have spent hundreds of dollars ‚Äúmy fault entirely‚Äù been double and triple charged at times ‚Äúnot my fault. Have reach level 123 and spend billions spin billions of coins with no progression. No VIP status even though I have played 9 months daily. I do have nearly 3000 Trick or Treats yay me. You get the same Bet Blast and Village Master which are useless when you can not build spins and close sets. I have also sent in 3 help tickets over the last 9 months without a response from any of them. So do not seek help there is none out there. I belong to several CM groups and am admin in one. Help other players as much as possible considering my game is stuck in dried cement and has been for 4 months. Gold trade is usually a card everyone has copious amounts of and the other very few have them so they are traded for ridiculous values or people buy of EBAY. I refuse to buy cards of EBAY. Let‚Äôs not forget the 6 to 8 pop ups every time I go into my game. Not good. You can go on main CM page and get a few spins daily or coins, but big celebrations they hipe up are not different than daily giveaways after 1-2 days. To the readers of this review do not build villages buy chests with coins and keep open sets to a bare minimum or you will be dead in the water as well and no hope ton progress.	negative
2617	406889139	games	3	The game is interesting with different twists. I would like it even more if my screen would not go to black when I‚Äôm acquiring free spins when a video comes on or when I‚Äôm getting free coins for watching a free demo/ video. Sometimes the screen even goes to  a blank white screen when I‚Äôm about to watch a demo/ game to get free extra coins or extra spins. When this happens most times I have to close out the game and then click on the icon to reactivate the game and it‚Äôll usually pick up where I left off, however I may not get the free spin or free coins. If the video showed then I would get the free coins or spins when it‚Äôs reactivated and it shows up on the screen but there‚Äôs been a few times when it had not given it to me (literally just a few times). The worst time the screen went to black or just just went to a blank white screen is when I had a raid with triple points and it didn‚Äôt allow me to continue to the raid when I reactivated the game nor did it just give me the points ü§Ø.Due to those mishaps I cannot give a higher rating. There are some more draw backs but that‚Äôs what makes it a game. Everything can‚Äôt be just easy without a few catches, that‚Äôs the challenge. Overall I like the game.	positive
2618	406889139	games	3	I started playing coin master because my whole family was raiding and attacking while I played other games on my phone and I wanted to join them. So I downloaded the game when I first started playing a had fun attacking others. It was not until I noticed that it was so hard to beat new levels because every time you finished an item in your village and your out of spins then while your waiting for more spins someone will come and destroy what you just finished upgrading. It got too frustrating so I decided to stop working on villages and started working on collecting cards. With that being said I literally spent all my money on chests. Every coin I received went straight towards a chest and man that whole finishing card sets thing is impossible. Even though I have spent all my coins for the past 2 months on chest I still have yet to finished a set because all the chest they give you are cards that you already have. So you can‚Äôt finish card sets and it‚Äôs hard to complete villages. Also you can‚Äôt trade gold cards. All these factors makes the game boring at times but I still play because my whole household does and it‚Äôs funny when you see their reactions after a raid or attacküòÇüòÇ	positive

2620	406889139	games	5	I‚Äôm about annoyed with CM. Three times I have purchased chest then I get crashed out. My coins are not refunded and I don‚Äôt get the chest when I start the app again. Also I notice that when there‚Äôs an event I‚Äôm not getting any spins coins or anything when I‚Äôm in the middle of building my village. This is beyond annoying. I know it‚Äôs a game but come on you telling me out of 2000 spins I can‚Äôt get anything but a couple of thousand here and there.  Not even enough to do any building. I submitted a ticket weeks ago with proof and I never got it resolved. Then there are not enough spins to start out with. Even if you win 600 during their events they are gone in less than 2 minutes. This game is so rigged. During events they give you more hammers if it‚Äôs a raid event and vice versa.  I feel for people to enjoy this game way more we should start out with 500 spins and 25 each hour.  Also this card situation needs to change why give out so many of the same cards.  I have so many like over 500 of a basic card. Please make this game more enjoyable	positive
2621	406889139	games	1	"I really like coin master game. For me it‚Äôs a stress reliever. It allows me to escape from day to day adulting. The game is a card collection, destroyer game with a casino twist. You would not think those got together but it does. When you start the game they tell you about cards they invite you to join a community of other coin master players. Some cards are rare and hard to get so you use this community to trade cards get tips and friends that play the game like you. There a chat rooms where people communicate about strategy game play events. They event invite you to add friends for spins. 

This is where it gets bad. So before in the game you could play with 20 people and they would rotate as your coin master. You steal coins from your coin master. Recently for some reason they stop the rotation and leave it on the same two coins masters for months. So that means you are stealing from the same person over and over and over again. Which defeats the purpose of the coin master community. So now I have all these friends I cannot play with these people that I have join a group with. I have reached out to support to get this resolve and it has not changed. Therefore I have to change my rating of this once great game. I hope they resolve this small issue just give people more that the same to coin masters."	positive
2622	406889139	games	1	"I have literally let loose things in the toilet that have a better customer response than the support of this game. They are just plain arrogant and rude. I inquired about 5 ‚Äúhammers‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt awarded when in fact I should have been, and within 8 minutes of my submitting my complaint I received a message that nothing was wrong on their end. It was literally my last spin that I had made, so I figured they could possibly check somehow. 

Even though you can tell the spins are rigged, and a 10 year old can figure out exactly how they are rigged via a simple algebraic equation, Its a fun game. Even though you can almost guarantee how the remainder of your last 30 spins will position you for the next time you play, it‚Äôs still a little entertaining. 

I spend money on many other games, and I would have spent it on this one too, but for them to basically call me a liar over 5 hammers which would have net me nothing is beyond absurd. If their goal is to scare away people who don‚Äôt drop money immediately, then they are doing a great job. Customer retention through properly answered concerns will build a bigger paying fan base, rather than curt rude answers. You already spent the time and money building the game, take that last step and your profits will be ten fold what they currently are."	positive
2623	406889139	games	3	"I don‚Äôt play games too much but, I came across this one and decided to try it. It‚Äôs really fun. However, I have become so addicted to it that I‚Äôve spent WAY too much money just to keep playing and stay in competition with others in tournaments. If you want to reach the goals to win spins and coins, you have to buy packages, otherwise, you will never reach the larger prizes. Yes, it‚Äôs my fault for buying so much. Additionally, I‚Äôm someone that has NEVER purchased anything in app before. 

I will no longer be purchasing anything because I have noticed that the higher the levels, the less you seem to get on your spins and raids and attacks don‚Äôt come up as much. And also, when you do get a raid, you don‚Äôt get as much. Even when you are playing x100. I went out of the game the other night, I had over 1,000 spins. When I went on the next day, it showed I only had the standard 50 plus 35 spins. I contacted them about it. While they got back with me pretty quick, they said I used them. Which I know I didn‚Äôt because i went straight to bed. I guess I‚Äôm playing it in my sleep. Couldn‚Äôt give five stars because the packages are too expensive for what you get."	positive
2624	406889139	games	1	"WARNING: DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS TERRIBLE GAME. DO NOT DOWNLAOD THIS TERRIBLE GAME. If I could give this game -600 STARS OR LESS I would. What a TERRIBLE app for customer service. I have tried for almost THREE weeks to get in contact with someone with NO RESPONSE. The only response I get is the automated email one to tell me someone will get back with me soon. I was awarded 600 spins for attacking and getting my bonus ‚Äúhammer‚Äù points. They popped up and said I won them, claimed them and the did NOT CREDIT MY SPINS. After nicely sending my problems through the support in the app, and replying to the automated emails with no response for almost THREE WEEKS, I am DONE with this stupid app. All they want you to do is spend money on top of money to actually play. Now that they owe me sometime like this, it‚Äôs like they do not want to help out. If I was spending $100‚Äôs of dollars to play such a dumb game I‚Äôm sure someone would have got back with me ASAP. I have been lucky to actually advance pretty far in the game. But recently the game has been COMPLETE GARBAGE. I used to love playing this game. Now it just makes me mad to look at it. Have not deleted yet because I want my dang 600 spins. GIVE THEM TO ME. Maybe this review will finally get someone on the ball to get me my awarded spins I never got??? Contact me? Hello?

2625	406889139	games	2	Fun game until you get further into the game. You get stuck on villages because you can‚Äôt get enough coins to build it. The game needs to give WAY MORE than 60 spins. When it cost 7-10billion coins or more to build your village, you need to 1. Give us more spins and 2. Change the amount of coins we get when we spin to larger amounts. Next, when we buy chests we shouldn‚Äôt have to spend billions of coins and not get any new cards, gold or white. I bought tons of chests and spent billions upon billions of coins and NEVER got and Armstrong card, had to buy it elsewhere just to have it. This is a game, it‚Äôs supposed to be fun, it stops being fun when you can‚Äôt advance and get stuck because the game is designed for you to lose/fail. Next, once you complete a card set, you no longer need cards in that set. I‚Äôve completed the first 30 card sets and STILL get cards the go with the very first set, WHY??? I can‚Äôt get cards for the set I‚Äôm in but still get tons of cards for the lower sets, WHY???? STOP GIVING THOSE EARLY SET CARDS!!!! Gold cards need to be more easily got, there is zero reason a player should be on a card set for 8 or more months and can‚Äôt get the cards, gold or white, the game isn‚Äôt fun anymore at that point!!	positive
2626	406889139	games	5	"I was confused at first but as time went on and I spent about $20-$30 (it‚Äôs never required to spend $$ because you get 5 spins every hour). I started to understand the game more. The more I understood the game, the more fun the game began to be, especially after level 3. And as with any other game the higher levels began to be more difficult. But I was not deterred. The game was not going to get me down to where I didn‚Äôt want to play the game anymore. It‚Äôs also fun to play a few minutes at a time when you have some downtime.

I‚Äôve had a lot of fun playing this game and I hope that this helps other people to stick with the game because it‚Äôs a lot easier to understand after you get past level three. Level three is where you start to get all the goodies such as pets and three times worth each spins if you click on the lightening bolt. 

Good luck to all who want to find a very fun game and with a little hard work you‚Äôll enjoy it as well. And again, I hope you find this explanatory. And most of all have fun."	positive
2627	406889139	games	5	I love this game first 2 maps I didn‚Äôt really like it all that until I started to really understand and get it I made about 60 or more people get this app 2nd app I‚Äôve done that for and it still wasn‚Äôt that much people. It‚Äôs jus when you‚Äôre out of spins and money there‚Äôs really nothing to do and you have to wait an entire hour jus to get 5 more spins which is finish In no time especially with the bets so I really hope coin master fixes that but I really enjoy playing this game with friends and family . :) and I don‚Äôt usually do reviews either so you know I either really want something fixed or I just really love the game or hate it. In this case I really love the game and want something fixed badly so I hope coin master owners see this and considers it.  And personal request/idea I believe if we‚Äôre able to send our friends more spins and coins that would make this game more fun. But I guess that wouldn‚Äôt benefit the owners in some ways but it would get more players and downloads and lovers :) Thank you !	positive
2628	406889139	games	5	This is a very exciting, fun game. I‚Äôve been playing over a year. The farther you get the harder it gets just like any other game. When first started play there were a lot of tech issues. Seems they‚Äôve worked out most of them. This game can be very aggravating as well. If your friends aren‚Äôt raiding or attacking the bots are. The higher the level the more stressful it becomes trying to build your village. But as it‚Äôs just a game you have to deal with the frustration of the game. Sometimes I can‚Äôt stop playing, other times I just want to delete it. But all in all it is a fun game. Sure keeps you on your toes with great events to help you through. Suggestion-take your time at each level. Try to get all the cards you can on each level. A must if you plan to do good as you go along. Be sure you feed ü¶ä when you play. He‚Äôs your coin getter. Rhino is a great protector so use him wisely. Find a group to join to help you through. I moderate a wonderful group. Very friendly & helpful. PM me if you‚Äôd like info to join. Good lucküçÄüçÄüçÄ	positive
2629	406889139	games	2	You know I love this game and been playing for a very long time. But there comes a point when consumers are feeling as if their being robbed. I‚Äôve spent so much money this week trying to complete my village and yet here we are again with game crashing before you can even spin, or get your raid or attack rewards and Viking quest just won‚Äôt open the doors before kicking you out. People are annoyed. There‚Äôs no need to run a diamond tournament, Raid& or attack along with Viking quest. Yes it‚Äôs fun but only if you can actually reap joy from getting your rewards. The pop ups are outta control. Your making yourself look greedy. I‚Äôve wasted my whole day trying to play and yet still at the same place I was days ago. And you really need to come off with some gold cards at some point. Without your 5 million followers you wouldn‚Äôt be successful. Your profiting millions a day yet it seems to still not be enough. Your going to lose so many of those followers and there goes all your hard work and success out the door. The five spins a hour is ridiculous and then on the reward links people don‚Äôt want coins we want/need spins. Please compensate me for something as your going to lose a financial supporter with me.	positive
2630	406889139	games	3	I‚Äôll start off by saying this game can be fun and addicting at times but those moments are few and far between for me as there will be times where you‚Äôll have tons of spins and will be zooming through levels and making tons of coins but then you have the times where you have no spins at all and the worst part is that the spins the game gives you feel rigged as you get a lot of random combos and most of the time don‚Äôt get anything good as well as the daily spin that lures you in with those big rewards but always land on the lowest reward usually 50k coins and then tells you you can get more by spending $4.99 to ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù your spinner. Then when you are out of spins you get i kid you not like 4 or 5 pop ups in a row that leave me getting frustrated every time I open the app and every time I‚Äôm run out of spins to the point that I just close the app and don‚Äôt come back until my spins are full it‚Äôs fun but just feels a lot like a cash cow where the game is so grindy that they pressure you to buy different packs to get coins and spins to progress through the levels and that grind only gets worse over time.	negative
2631	406889139	games	3	"I love this game but my goodness you can‚Äôt even get right into playing it without have to click through at least 5 pop ups. It‚Äôs just unnecessary, everything doesn‚Äôt require a pop up it‚Äôs slows down the gaming experience and is irritating. I often find myself quickly exiting the game once I‚Äôve run out of spins just to avoid pop ups. There should be tabs added about the daily specials in order to decrease all those pop ups so you can actually get to playing instead of spending time exiting out of pop ups.

Also this game is Facebook Friendly and doesn‚Äôt offer an alternative way to swap cards with other players. I have way too many duplicates of cards and can‚Äôt do anything with them all because i do not have Facebook. It would be great to be able to switch or trade instead of being stuck with 10 of the same cards all because I don‚Äôt have Facebook. It would also be good to hit a maximum on how many times you can receive a card. I literally get the same ones over and over again. I don‚Äôt see how people actually complete the sets without taking a gamble and spending money to buy a chest."	positive
2632	406889139	games	1	"I downloaded the game to meet an ad/reward offer from a different game. It seemed like it was going to be a piece of cake! I ONLY needed to complete my 3rd village. It took me less than an hour to complete my first two, almost there. However, I have been stuck on the 3rd village for a week. There is no end in sight. I have been calculating my spins. I receive 1 shield per 50 spins. 4 attacks, all of which were blocked by shields. And 1 raid. Everything else was not much to write about. In my 50 spins I accrued 1.7 million coins which was enough to upgrade one item. Furthermore, I was attacked 10 times in the previous day, and raided several more times. Everything accrued in my 50 spins is upkeep and no progress. Even more aggravating are ALL OF THE POPUPS for buying spins, inviting friends from social media, connecting through Facebook, and asking me to purchase during the ‚Äúsale of the day‚Äù.   Every time one has one more spin and then again when one runs out they are bombarded by ALL OF THE POPUPS. 

I have contacted them to make them aware of their gameplay issue and have received only stock ‚Äúit‚Äôs the algorithm, just keep playing‚Äù response. 

This game is a scam, I don‚Äôt believe anyone has made it beyond village 5, maybe, without paying to play."	negative
2633	406889139	games	4	"I too liked playing this game at first.  But after spending weeks on trying to fix one level it‚Äôs becoming boring.  I also don‚Äôt like the fact that there are only 3 slots for shields.  When you have these bet max challenges and if, for example you bet 6 spins and land on 3 shields which are tripled to 6 shields but only get to keep 3 of those 6 shields (or minus any shields that are already in the slots).  This is not ok.  I have lost almost 20 shields because of this.  And why is it you can buy spins and coins but not shields?  
Now for the daily spin wheel.  I am sure the algorithm your team created for this part of the game only allows 1 in a million chance to actually win the 10 million coins (or something to that effect) Why put it on there at all. 
Plus how about increasing the coins by the same way you do with the spins (x 2,3,4...etc.). Increase the free spins to 20 every 15 minutes.
This needs to match the frequency of the events you have so we have a better chance playing in the events.  
Thank you"	positive
2634	406889139	games	4	I love the game and it‚Äôs easily addictive however some little things are there that makes you not want to play anymore. The main one being the tournaments, I don‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs set up, you‚Äôre just playing against random people and that‚Äôs annoying. It would be nice to only be playing against your friends so you can see who you‚Äôre winning or losing to. Also every time I find myself in first place on those tournaments two minutes later somebody random just comes out of nowhere with double the amount of points you have and I feel like they do that purposefully to get you to spend money on this game and it‚Äôs very annoying. The next thing is the overkill on the pop ups. We know there‚Äôs somewhere to buy spins and we know what options we have when we run out of spins. If you show us something one time it‚Äôs fine but you don‚Äôt need to keep showing it every 2 seconds that‚Äôs just so annoying. I can understand for new comers but for someone who‚Äôs at village 120 I think we get the gist by now. Other than that it‚Äôs a great game to play.	positive
2635	406889139	games	2	"I use to love playing this game! 
But now my spins disappear, ones I purchased, ones I have won, it glitches, it has become a daily issue, when I emailed support, I was told they couldn‚Äôt confirm my issue! Which is complete bs because tons of people have the same complaints yet it never gets fixed! I woke up today , to over 300 spins just missing, the other day over 1600 missing, two weeks ago it was 800 spins that I won, once they got awarded, and I hit 5x spin, all of my spins where gone except 60. This happens regularly and nothing is every done to resolve it! And god forbid we actually win the card sets, ive had to start buying chests to win cards because I didn‚Äôt win a single new card 45 levels.

Edit: so I got and mail directing me to the help center! The help center doesn‚Äôt help at all and I was recommended to update my review! Your app glitches too much, of steals our spins, when we raid a level we don‚Äôt get the coins as if it never happened. And this happened regularly, maybe you should give back all the spins that the game stole back, and all the coins maybe then I‚Äôll update my review. Because 1600 coins doesn‚Äôt cover the amount of spins that the game stole from me!"	positive
2636	406889139	games	2	I will start by saying that I do absolutely enjoy playing coin master! However, I‚Äôm lucky to even be able to play it most days! Today, just like yesterday, I have been opening coin master (close the million boxes/windows that open up when you first open the app) only to be taken back to my home screen because the app closed the very second I got out of the last window that opened. In addition to that, another feature in the game that I enjoy (probably more than anything, including coin master itself) is Viking Quest. Unfortunately, I have only been able to play the last time they had the Viking quest event going. I was so happy to finally be able to play it that I almost entirely forgot about the issue of the game booting me out of nowhere.... and just as I remember that, the dang app kicks me out and closes!!! I don‚Äôt know if the menu having support and help is a new feature, but even though I keep up with updates, being able to leave this review is the closest thing that I have found to be able to share the problems I‚Äôve been having. I love coin master but I‚Äôve honestly considered uninstalling the game recently because I‚Äôm so frustrated!!	positive
2637	406889139	games	3	This game is great but there are several bad areas along with the good. Ex. It‚Äôs great as a war game per say and also very addictive it keeps me wanting to play but if you are like me you would want to be shown the gratitude of gaining in game perks like getting pets more often and (my biggest con) getting useful characters to complete sets. I‚Äôve been playing for some time now and have spent hundreds of millions in coins on crates JUST to get a beast card but only get cards that are useless. It‚Äôs a great game but if you spend real money it‚Äôs not worth it. Spins are rigged to an extent because during an event where you‚Äôll have to get so many torches you will get them very often to get coins but when the free spins come up it takes forever once you‚Äôve passed several turns.(ex). To win 1000 free spins you‚Äôll need to get 350 torches, but unlike in the beginning of event the wheel basically teases you where in the beginning 1out of 5-6 will be torches or raid or attack to advance you closer to the set goal but not in rounds where the stake are higher. Ok enough of my ramblings. Please creators make some changes after all you made it for us to ENJOY not be frustrated.	positive
2638	406889139	games	3	Hi just wanted to express how I would play this game everyday but it‚Äôs not getting rewarded as it shows, lose spins without enough seconds to use. I emailed and even asked support if I had a time limit after purchasing spins and they said no but I lost my spins within seconds of purchases. I went to support and advised them about spin wins and they go on to say they checked and they were awarded accordingly and didn‚Äôt even got 1 spin for their misleading gamer. I have been very disappointed with their customer support and feel I need to screen shot my allegations or it‚Äôs not valid. I played with Ipad sometimes because I would use up my battery on my phone and switch to other ways to play, I no longer desire to rush from devices anymore because it‚Äôs not fun when you have to prove you didn‚Äôt get rewards as they say they would. I played this game with family members everyday but now just wait for whatever is given, I stop paying to buy coins or spins because it wasn‚Äôt awarded correctly, this game was fun but not anymore. May you start believing in the customer instead of challenging their claims.	positive
2639	406889139	games	2	I absolutely loved this game at first. It was a GREAT way to pass some time. However, for the last week-ish, this game has been a complete waste of my time and a total rip off. In the game you can ‚Äúraid‚Äù and ‚Äúattack‚Äù other villages and players. This is a good way to get coins and to get the items you need to get more spins, coins, pet snacks, etc. Everytime my gameplay gets an attack or a raid I get a ‚Äúlost connection‚Äù notification and it won‚Äôt let me exit out of it or return back to the game. I have to close the game out and reopen it up and then I have to go through the entire annoying process of all the stupid pop ups that the game throws at you before I can even start playing again. I have not been able to raid or attack a village in about a week now since I have only been able to land on non important things within the game so I feel like it‚Äôs completely ripping me off. I have notified the tech support or whatever you want to call them via email and have never heard a response. I just want the bug fixed and/or all my wasted spins and extra things I get for raids and attacks on that little power bar at the top. I‚Äôm stuck in glitch hell and am about to just delete the app.	negative
2640	406889139	games	1	This game could be so much better just by doing a few things; 1. Don‚Äôt make us wait 1 hour for 5-6 spins. 2. The villages are super expensive to buy and it takes forever to progress because I can only save up so much and lack the rest of the money I need due to so few spins available and when I come back to play after spins being refilled of course all my money is gone and I have to again fix my village! Coin Trip has a great set up where you have a time frame for protection!! 3. Not fair that the same person can attack you over and over and over but when you go to revenge it just downloads! 4. Offers cost way too much ($6.99 to spin the wheel when you likely get the lowest prize anyway!) I really am about ready to delete this game seriously. It‚Äôs just become way to expensive and I‚Äôm sick of putting money into it and I can‚Äôt even get anywhere... at least provide some interaction game time with better offers or something! Oh and the cards!!! I am on level 76 and I still need one last card from the very first card set!!! I have duplicates up to 12+ and why am I still getting card offers for completed sets!!! You‚Äôre going to draw people away with tactics like this.....	positive
2641	406889139	games	5	I have absolutely no problems but one suggestion is being able to revenge someone twice or on a raid. Someone stole a fortune of my treasure and i tried attacking her but she had sheilds. So as i got my first raid, i thought you can revenge on raid, but when i tried to, you cannot revenge on raid. This game is already good enough to cost like 1 dollar, but it would be so much fair and better if you can revenge on raid. 5 star rating, live this game. If the developer sees this i give a special thanks for making this game. It really boosts my energy for quarantine . Once again, thank you. (Bonus compliment: this should be the 2nd best rated app in this app store.) I also love the little pets to help you win raids. I also got a glitch where i stole more treasure then who i was raiding had, and i never got their treasure.. they had exactly 1,008,000 and i stole about 1,240,009. Possibly could you fix this glitch? If possible thanks. This game will destroy everyone‚Äôs miserable time in quarantine! üìù‚ù§Ô∏èüòä	positive
2642	406889139	games	2	"Coin master is fun and I‚Äôve gotten a few friends to join me but the longer I play the more frustrating the game becomes. I hardly ever get new cards in chests , never any gold cards to complete sets and at the level I‚Äôm at it‚Äôs nearly impossible to progress with only 60 spins so then your obligated to buy or you rely on winning them but the game is super rigged. You can tell when it ‚Äúwants‚Äù you to play or not based on how generous it is or how determined it seems to keep you from progressing. And Don‚Äôt get me started on the GLITCHES! This game glitches all the time has multiple errors and when you reach out to tech support they come back at you with did you record the incident?! NO I did NOT record it because I‚Äôm not a weirdo who records when I play a stupids slot machine game
Update: I reached out to customer service about the issues and their response was the update the game, turn my phone on and off and clear my cache üò° are they serious?! I pay for spins often so when I loose a raid that I bet 40 spins on you‚Äôd better believe I want to be reimbursed for the spins and coins lost! But noooo, their customer service is crapü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨"	positive
2643	406889139	games	2	Don‚Äôt get spins in enough time, it glitches or freezes and when it comes back your spins and money are gone. Continues to give the same cards over and over again and none of the ones you need. Random people who are not your friends raid you while you‚Äôre sleeping. I understand the attacks be random from people you don‚Äôt know but not the raids. Then the constant pop ups to add friends is really annoying. Like yes I have 1 spin left, no I don‚Äôt want to add any people, no I don‚Äôt want to buy any spins, stop with the constant pop ups. Once is enough. It‚Äôs really annoying. Then the gold card trades majority of the time only happen when people are sleeping. I‚Äôm not spending my hard earned money on a game that I will never see any reward in real life. The links for the gifts barely work. You play the games they post on Facebook and never get the rewards. There should be a limit to how many times a single person can attack you in a day. The spins should regenerate in 30 minutes not an hour. Who has 10 hours to wait around for spins to regenerate fully when you‚Äôre constantly being attacked or raided by random people who you‚Äôre not friends with on Facebook.	negative
2644	406889139	games	4	I really didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like it. But I am so glad I gave it a try. It is a cute game that doesn‚Äôt need a ton of attention & you can play on the fly. Though, with that being said, I see myself wanting to play it more & more. The only thing I wish they would change, is the fact if you get friends to join, they can not play with you, unless they are on FB. There should be an email option for those whom do not wish to sign up with FB. My hub, whom I showed this little game to, likes it & wants to play with me, but can not due to the fact he doesn‚Äôt have Fb. Look there are lots of guys out there, that don‚Äôt do the whole ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù platforms, there needs to be an another option for them. Why give a texting option, if they‚Äôre then forced to only play as guests & either sign up with fb or never have the fun of playing up against the ones that got them started. Not to mention it doesn‚Äôt give you the energy as advertised either, unless they break down & create a fb. If this part was diff I‚Äôd give 5 stars.	positive
2645	406889139	games	5	I have been playing for a while I was on level 98 until I got so aggravated that I deleted the game. I obviously enjoyed the game but the aggravation became too much. 6 coins an hour capping at 60 isn‚Äôt enough to build your village when you get to the upper levels which is how the game makes money, I get it. I have bought many packages. But what is annoying is I have not received a new or gold card in over a month. I am constantly buying magical or gold chest, I hit 1.2 billion on the daily spin and bought nothing but chest and never got one new cardüò°üò°üò° I don‚Äôt know how new cards are set up to be given but it isn‚Äôt working. I‚Äôm constantly seeing other people with the same problem. As annoying as this is it‚Äôs still not what caused me to delete, I have won things in the past on different events and not received my coins but this time it failed to give me my 1000 spins that I won on the attack madness event. I like this game but the aggravation is too much.	negative
2646	406889139	games	3	"I have played this game since it has started. I also have spent a lot of money over the years. Never had a problem until lately.... my first problem is on the mini games ya they are good and I enjoy them but I have won 600 spins and I was never given them on attack madness this was about 2 weeks ago and I‚Äôve message and emailed the support team never once did I get a reply nor did I get a respond. Yea I get it I‚Äôm sure y‚Äôall get a lot of messages but I most definitely should of heard back from someone by now. That is called fraud or scamming if you do a promotion and someone wins it they are supposed to be given their prize... I know it‚Äôs not y‚Äôall fault but I was really hopping y‚Äôall would of done something about it. 2nd the app keeps crashing saying the connection was lost it does it so much that I  am starting to not wanna play y‚Äôall should really fix the issue bc I know my WiFi is working fine bc nine is my other game have any issues. I was really y‚Äôall would of fixed it I never had problems before and if it doesn‚Äôt get fix I will have no choice but to delete the app all together.

2647	406889139	games	4	I have been playing this game almost a year I‚Äôm I‚Äôm am so tired of being spammed with pop ups. It‚Äôs really starting to make me mad. When you start the game it‚Äôs an automatic 6 pop ups. Then randomly a pop up show up. If your betting 20 spins and get down to 10 you will get another 6 pop ups. Then when you lower your bet to use your remaining spins, once completed you get another 6 pop ups. God forbid you go to start building because sometimes you will get the pop ups again. The worst part? They are all the same pop ups! If this doesn‚Äôt change soon I‚Äôm going to have to delete this game. It‚Äôs been an ongoing problem and the developers don‚Äôt seem to care. Sometimes on the events you don‚Äôt get your prizes. I won 240m on the attack event but the game said congratulations and never actually gave me the coins. Tried contacting support and nothing was ever done to compensate me. I don‚Äôt suggest spending money because if they can‚Äôt help you in game they sure can‚Äôt help you with purchases or problems that can come with it.	positive

A waste to get the same cards each time there‚Äôs no card to complete the sets that contain more spins  a lot of duplicates seem rigged to me I enjoy playing my family plays I advised them not to buy anymore of the offers you put up because it‚Äôs a cycle you don‚Äôt win only costing money and each offer increases and you still don‚Äôt accomplish your goal. Sure I‚Äôm complaining yet I enjoy playing it‚Äôs fun with my family just not purchasing any more offers can get very expensive.

2649	406889139	games	1	I‚Äôve been playing this game for quite sometime and in the beginning it was awesome however now I can‚Äôt play any of the events. Every single time I land on a raid or attack it automatically crashes therefore I don‚Äôt get rewarded for it. Every time you have one of the events to where all the attacks, raids and perfect spins adds up to win the main prize well I don‚Äôt get that because all I get is, I have to have the perfect spin and nothing else counts when it does for eveyone else. I‚Äôve messaged Coin Master more times than I can count only to get the same reply which is to clear my cache and it will be fine when in fact I do that every day and it still doesn‚Äôt help, be wiped my phone completely out and still can‚Äôt get the game to play without crashing. Another thing is I actually spent real money to buy spins etc only to be ripped off and yet to get what I PAID for. I can‚Äôt even view my cards due to it crashing when I try to go into it. Last but not least every time I try to go into a Vikings game, as everything else it crashes before it even loads up. At one point I would have rated this game 5stars however now I wouldn‚Äôt even give it 1 star. FIX the problem!!!	positive
2650	301521403	health_and_fitness	2	I‚Äôve been using NTC club for around 4-5 years and it‚Äôs been my holy grail for working out. It got me started on a new lifestyle, and it‚Äôs helped me stay active even on days where I feel like I don‚Äôt have the time. The problem I have now though is with the most recent update where it takes the training programs and makes them premium only. Although I understand that the app still has all the old workouts I loved for free, what I‚Äôm upset about is that they completely scraped the free version of the plan system. The only reason I used the app in the first place was to have that customized plan in place and as we speak I was in the middle of a plan, and to have it taken away from me days before finishing when I was planning on moving to the next one, is a huge let down. I‚Äôve always had a problem knowing which workouts to do in order, and the structure that came from the free plans is what helped me want to workout everyday. NTC updates have let me down before and they usually come back around, but in this case, I‚Äôm more disappointed than usual. I love this app and the workouts and as a college student, I can‚Äôt afford the premium plans. I‚Äôve depended on the plan systems for years now and now it feels like my personal use for the app has greatly diminished. I‚Äôm probably still going to use NTC because it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever known, but if there could be some re-implementation of the free training plan system I‚Äôd make my rating much higher.	positive
2651	301521403	health_and_fitness	3	"I started using this app a good 8 years ago, using it here and there over the years. I feel like the older version made it easier to find your usual workouts, and had better workouts. In the current version (using it a lot these days, since we are all on social lockdown), there is not a spot to find all your downloaded workouts- if you want to easily find them, you have to bookmark AND download them. My other gripe is that it only will let you use Apple Music to play along. Having other streaming services implemented seems like a given. Finally, ‚Äúequipment.‚Äù While  you can search workouts based on ‚Äúbasic,‚Äù ‚Äúno,‚Äù and ‚Äúfull‚Äù equipment, it would be great if I could search based on which equipment I have. While I may not have a bench, I do have other pieces that fall into the full category. Currently, you have to go into each workout to see what equipment is needed, and it‚Äôs a bit tedious.

A little off tangent, but I would love it if each workout had an ‚Äúinfo‚Äù button of sorts, featuring the apparel / shoes worn in the workout. I understand a lot of the workouts were recorded a while ago, but knowing what type of shoes the model was wearing would be helpful. Generally, there‚Äôs an updated version that comes close (basically, Nike, there‚Äôs a pair worn that i would love to have!üòâ)."	positive
2652	301521403	health_and_fitness	1	"I fell in love with this app when I first started using it. It was helpful to see the plan laid out in front of me. I also really enjoyed the feature where if a workout one day was too easy for me they would up the intensity next week. Unfortunately, I took a break from working out after experiencing the worst break up. It was only supposed to last a week but then it turned into months. When I finally felt ready to workout again I logged into my app to see that things have changed. I was freaking out. I have now been on a search for a similar app that is also free but I can‚Äôt find one. Because I have so much trouble trying to put a workout together because there is way to much information out there, I have yet to workout anywhere close to the way I used to. And my consistency is lacking. I can‚Äôt tell you how many people I recommended to get this app. Now I will have to tell people I have stopped using it because they don‚Äôt have this feature anymore. 

UPDATE: so when I had first logged into my app it said you guys would not be offering this feature anymore. Now it is a premium feature, which upsets me even more. Nike makes so much money as a company. You want me to pay $15 per month for a feature that used to be free. Nike promotes fitness but when it comes to money they don‚Äôt mind taking away features and making things less accessible to others. I AM SO THROUGH WITH SUPPORTING NIKE."	positive
2653	301521403	health_and_fitness	1	"I‚Äôve been using this app for many years and it was the perfect training companion. There were some minor hiccups in the past (some interferences with Apple Music app while exercising or sometimes the training would freeze if you were mirroring it on a tv..) but it was by far the best app ever developed.
Sadly developers decided to remove the planning feature which was the huge plus over all the others apps. The app was able to support the definition of a specific training and support the weekly schedule, adjusting based on participation and feedback. I can‚Äôt tell if the app was really able to adjust the training over time, but it definitely provided the feeling of being followed and supported during sessions. Especially for those (like me) that have little time for training and want a product that is doing all the preparation, improving efficiency.
Even if this app contains a lot of outstanding material, I‚Äôm giving it just one star because without the plan feature this is just a average confusing app, that makes it even harder to identify how to exercise in the little available time. Defining what to do is just a nightmare.
BRING THE PLAN FEATURE BACK..I‚Äôm going to stop using it for now and transition to a easier app..for the first time in many years I even bought a pair of shoes from a different brand since Nike is not my favorite brand anymore..."	positive
2654	301521403	health_and_fitness	3	I‚Äôve always gone to the gym but never really knew ‚Äúhow‚Äù to workout. I never really knew what muscle groups to do together and when to add in cardio. I felt like I was working out for hours at the gym with results taking what felt like forever! Then I stumbled upon this app and absolutely loved it! Not only were there videos of how to properly do each workout but there was a ‚Äúbuild my plan‚Äù option where a workout plan was created for you! You‚Äôd simply answer questions based on your health and goals and boom a whole entire workout plan was right at your fingertips! I finally saw the results I had been looking for when working out and I owed it all to NTC! But then one dreadful day I went in to open the app to find that the best feature of this app, build my plan was GONE! I searched and searched and even tried replicating past workouts only to find myself sore and agitated. Nike, my question to you is WHY? Why take such a precious and greatly loved option away from loyal users? Isn‚Äôt your goal as a large corporation to help your customers be the best version of themselves?  Please consider bringing it back! My workouts haven‚Äôt been the same since.	positive
2655	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	"I kept putting off buying the premium version but I finally did and am thoroughly impressed. The workouts are way more intense and I definitely see better results now. I know people were upset about it not being free, but you‚Äôre getting a lot of programs at a discounted price in comparison to joining a gym where you‚Äôd be paying almost 400 for the year so you get your money‚Äôs worth. In addition they give nutritional information that complements the workouts that you‚Äôre doing. I‚Äôm surprised that people find that bothersome. All in all you‚Äôre getting your moneys worth for great sessions. I recommend that if you do get the premium version, get the year because you do save more than paying monthly.

*Edit*

It‚Äôs still good, however the app doesn‚Äôt properly track the amount of calories burned. So it‚Äôll say I burned about 250 but once my workout is done it will say I only burned like 140 or even 45! Please fix this glitch. Ive learned that exited the app mid work out and continuously going to activity app tracks it properly but it‚Äôs still inconvenient as hell."	positive
2656	301521403	health_and_fitness	3	Great App, but feels like there is so much more potential. Admittedly, I may represent a smaller user-base but I find myself wishing you had a library of exercises that I could pull from to create my own workouts, setting the respective timers and breaks, etc. Currently using an App called SecondsPro that allows me (and the group I work out with) to build our own workouts, but it's all manual and there is no audio or video helping explain or show proper form. Also, the interface is terrible, it would be so easy to design a really simple, intuitive UI that allows me to select the exercises I want from a library, tagged properly (muscle-group, etc) and quickly generate new workouts. You (Nike) would be controlling the audio and video so you can still brand it accordingly and help reinforce the amazing Nike brand. You could also consider other sponsors or advertisers and introduce them in tactful ways and people would still use the App so much more. That's my 2 cents, happy to talk more if you're interested in picking my brain. Equally happy to just see some of these features introduced into the App. Thanks, Mike	positive
2657	301521403	health_and_fitness	2	The premium service is disappointing. The workout formats are a regression from the current ‚Äúfree‚Äù format. The whiteboard format is particularly bad. The burden of pacing, timing, and tracking is placed on the user. There is no watch integration. The ‚Äúfree‚Äú workouts that are available seem to be more featured with ongoing instructions, motivation, time tracking + progress updates, and watch integration with haptic nudging so the user can concentrate on form and mental strength (instead of a clock). While the ‚Äúclass‚Äù format is interesting + interactive, there can be a lot of waiting and instruction upfront and throughout making the work out feel slow and sometimes non-energetic‚Äîplus no vitals information (no heart rate or calories) and no watch integration. Honestly I would rather pay the premium price to bring back the plans that were removed a while back. Please hint to me I‚Äôm wrong, or to stay tuned for updates to the service. I was a huge NTC user but i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to make it past the free trial. I‚Äôm really happy that the previous feature set is still available‚Äîbut I do think those workouts are getting pretty stale. Bring back plans please.	positive
2658	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	i have tried many many MANY workout apps, and believe me i have gotten very agitated. i‚Äôve googled and searched and downloaded so so many apps and none of them were right. they were either not free of just not a good overall app. this app is PERFECT. it shows you exactly what to do and adjusts your plan to your lifestyle. it helps you keep your workout goal as well as push yourself. it speaks aloud so you don‚Äôt have to constantly look down at your phone when all you want to do is focus. there are such a variety of exercises and workout routines so you can pick the one that‚Äôs right for you. this is the best workout app i have ever found and i will definitely be using it a lot his year. i‚Äôve had it for only 2 days and i am ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with it. it motivates me to workout and gives me checking points on my personal workout. this is just what i needed to turn my workout goals into a habit. i have never been more motivated to reach my workout goal. this app was life changing.	positive
2659	301521403	health_and_fitness	4	I‚Äôve been a user of this app on and off again through the years and I keep coming back to it because it motivates me and pushes me to get a sweat in, without being intimidating like a personal trainer or finding workout buddies. But, recently I have started again and been wanting to get ‚Äúwedding ready‚Äù; but every time I start a workout plan and I choose the six week plan, after completing three workouts of that plan, the plan disappears from the ‚Äúmy plan‚Äù section and I have to start the six week plan from scratch. Maybe Nike is finding a way to reset my start date and make me get more workouts in, like when a trainer says ‚Äúone more rep‚Äù but they end up lying and start your set all over again? But it‚Äôs becoming frustrating and I might give up on sticking to a ‚Äúplan‚Äù and just manually select a single workout when my little chubby heart desires. If the app stability and the bugs from the plans can get fixed, I would scream from the top of the Salesforce building about how great this app is.	negative
2660	301521403	health_and_fitness	4	I started using NTC (& NRC - also great!)last July and immediately fell in love! I was just getting back into working out and the 4 week Get Started Plan was perfect. I then completed the Lean Fit Plan 3 times before the most recent update that removed the Training Plans. Since July I dropped 12 pounds and significantly increased my strength and endurance and was really excited to continue my progress into the new year! However, although I have continued using NTC just as frequently, it‚Äôs just not the same without the plans! I loved getting the alert on my phone the night before telling me what I had ‚Äúcoming up‚Äù the next day and I never felt over or undertrained - it was the perfect mix of workouts! I fully realize that I should just be able to follow the Collection and it should be the same but it just isn‚Äôt! Keep the Collections but reinstate the old Plans! Anyway, it‚Äôs a great app - I am continually in awe that it‚Äôs free - and I will certainly continue to use it but please, please, please bring back the training plans!!!!	positive
2661	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	"I love this app so much! I‚Äôve tried other workout apps, and unsurprisingly, they don‚Äôt even come close to touching the excellence of NTC. I‚Äôve been using this app since 2014 & it continues to get better with each update! It‚Äôs like having a pocket personal trainer with the guided workouts & especially with the training plans. 

My only issue: I have incurred two knee injuries since downloading this app & there is no pause button on workout plans. It‚Äôs very discouraging when you‚Äôre on track for 5 weeks & the app continues processing your last weeks like you just gave up. I also wish that modified plans / exercises were available for people who have dealt with common injuries (such as modified moves for squats/lunges). These preferences have not affected the rating I‚Äôd give this app as they are personal requests that I have as a result of injury (despite my opinion that injury is a thing that most athletic people experience at some point of their life, even if it‚Äôs just a pulled muscle)."	positive
2662	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	"This app was amazing and I was kind shocked that I found it so late. The best part of this app: the plans. These were based on your schedule and the equipment that you had available to you. Enter that info and it spit out a schedule. . It really helped give me some guidance and structure without paying for a trainer at the gym. I did realize more tone and definition to my body.  The workouts were solid and varied enough that you didn‚Äôt get bored. I probably did 4 plans in a row with different lengths. 

However, someone or some team at Nike has decided to remove the plans. That alone set  this workout app apart from all the others. It‚Äôs just a run of the mill app now. It went backwards and does what other apps do now and has nothing that makes it stand out. I recommended this app to people all the time based on the plans, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it now. Funny this is, the Nike Running Club app still has plans. Guess it couldn‚Äôt be supported in two places."	positive
2663	301521403	health_and_fitness	1	"‚ÄúPremium‚Äù workouts left me feeling lost, frustrated, and negative about wanting to go back to the gym. This app was the reason I finally started working out, and the free content is still great, but the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù content is the epitome of what I hate about gyms in general - if you don‚Äôt already know what you‚Äôre doing or have a personal trainer with you, you just feel like an outsider with no chance of accomplishing anything. 

Even more frustrating, and more devastating to the entire experience, the app now has a 90% failure rate on my Watch where it either won‚Äôt track the workout at all, or even worse it gets stuck in some kind of error loop where in addition to not tracking the workout, the app forces the HR tracker to stay on uncommanded, even after uninstalling the app from the Watch and forcing it to reboot, meaning it has to be commanded from the phone app!!

Until this gets fixed, NTC is coming off my phone. This app was my muse, it got me working out when nothing else did, and I‚Äôm sad to see it go because it worked so well for me. But between feeling excluded by the new premium content, and the infuriating experience on my Nike+ Watch, I‚Äôll feel even worse trying to use it."	negative
2664	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	I can‚Äôt stop telling people about the NTC premium content so I figured maybe I should tell the Internets. I have had NTC for years and have always appreciated what was on there (for free) but they were never my ‚Äúgo to‚Äù. I am currently on my 6th time through the Burn program with KG and let me tell you, it has changed my life. Might sound dramatic but honestly- 7 months ago I was in constant pain (lower back and sciatic), couldn‚Äôt sleep because of it and was starting to consider the possibility of surgery.  3 weeks into the program I felt more relief than I had in years. KG works the heck out of your core- giving you the same cues and instruction you would from a personal trainer (or even physical therapy in my case!) and tones the rest of your body as well. I am pain free for the most part, a whole size smaller and the healthiest I have felt in a long time. Premium content is worth EVERY PENNY. Sign up for it. Just do it. üòâ	positive
2665	301521403	health_and_fitness	3	"NTC has always been my #1 fitness app and have used it for years (practically forever) so I was super hyped for the new update. But it‚Äôs already problematic and it‚Äôs been two days. 

The premium features are good, the workouts look cool and the tips are ok but tracking activity is garbage. Before, it would track on my Apple Watch and show up both on my Health App and NTC; the app showing activity and buzzing on my watch as the workout progressed. With premium, it doesn‚Äôt do that. At all. My watch will say Let‚Äôs Start Training and not move past that screen for the entire workout. Not tracking anything. When I used it yesterday, after completing the workout, it said I burned zero calories and worked out for zero minutes (mind you, it was 30 minute workout). This morning, the app crashed and didn‚Äôt count the workout towards the program.

Nike need to get it together if they plan on charging $15 a month. It‚Äôs totally not worth it, if people are paying for something that doesn‚Äôt track activity properly (or at all). The app performed better when it was free."	positive
2666	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	I love this app so far!! I am a highly competitive high school basketball player, and am used to very intense workouts and/or conditioning sessions. This is a great app for working out during the off season. It offers motivating commentary (often annoying, sometimes encouraging), and easy-hard workouts. It has many short work outs, giving me no excuse to skip one, and always making sure I have time for one. Whether it‚Äôs midday, at night, early morning, or all three! I will continue to use this app, as it serves me well. I only wish they added more basketball stars (such as Lebron James, The King üëë) or added an easier way to message the experts. My father works with the military, so I travel a lot. Currently I am in japan, and can sadly not send messages to the experts on the Nike team. However, those are my only complaints. Overall, this is a nice, quality app with a great music feature, and an even greater easy to use layout. I rate this 5/5.	positive
2667	301521403	health_and_fitness	4	"I love this app, I‚Äôve been using the Bettina Gozo program, and am loving it and her. My only complaint is that I have a couple of times exited out of the app accidentally, and when I go back in to it, it wants me to start that days workout all over again. It seems any progress I had as far as calories burned (from my Apple Watch) is gone. I did this today, and had to fast forward the video back to where I was and pick up from where I was. Also, I went into the activity app and the workout did even register, which is slightly frustrating, from a tracking standpoint. Nike, this app is great, but please make it so that you can resume and not loose all of your data the moment you exit out mid workout!

Update April 2020
Still using the app on a daily basis but it seems to be crashing a lot lately while browsing workouts. It‚Äôs a little frustrating to find a workout and then have the app crash and have to go and set the filters again to find it.  Please fix!"	positive
2668	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	"I‚Äôve used Free version of NTC on and off as it has a good variety of workouts and I like incorporating different styles into my routine.

Now with the ‚Äústay at home‚Äù challenges facing us, I‚Äôm doing all my workout home, so I needed a bigger collection. NTC at first wasn‚Äôt my go to since there‚Äôs another free app that has all variety of workouts for free and I could rely on that better as my number 1, but now that NTC has made their premium plan free during this time (which is a very nice gesture), I am using it as my number 1 option and loving it!

I really hope they keep it free for long, as the paid version pushes away many of us simply since there are many alternatives for most people that are either free or included in their daily gyms they attend. But a free NTC is very attractive and helpful in motivating more workout from home. Thank you for making this available for free during this time and hope it stays that way for long!"	positive
2669	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	"I‚Äôve been using this app for 2 years now and I cannot express myself enough on how happy I am that NTC exists. To begin with, workouts are hands down p e r f e c t! You have plenty of them to choose from, you can have a decent training in 15 minutes or less(not to mention that you can/should mix it with NRC), most of them are free and after all, they are kinda fun. I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of the new premium version to be honest, but that shouldn‚Äôt stop you from exercising. You don‚Äôt have to waste time and money at the gym if your goal is to stay fit. I can say for myself that I‚Äôve developed my body(mostly abs, legs and arms) extremely good only by doing bodyweight workouts from Nike. 2 months ago I went to the gym with my friend and didn‚Äôt fall behind at all- I even leg pressed 300kg that day!
 In conclusion, this app is out of this world and I gladly suggest anyone to click that download button. Train, stay healthy and enjoy the process!"	positive
2670	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	I can‚Äôt say enough for this app. It‚Äôs amazing with its variety of exercises, ease of use, it even has some classes (pre-recorded) with athletes and trainers. There are variety of levels and session times which is amazing as sometimes you only have 5-10 min in your morning; right there you can no longer miss to take care of your health anymore. It can‚Äôt be any better than that and all for free. You can also do a program which is exercises picked based on your level and your focus and the program could be 6-8 weeks for example. I also pare it with Nike Run Club so some days I do a training and others just a run with it‚Äôs sister app. I‚Äôve been using this app for over 3 years now, had tried many others but after I check them I usually remove them from my phone or let them sit unused. If you‚Äôve never tried it, you might want to because you are missing out. Good luck!	positive
2671	301521403	health_and_fitness	2	"I‚Äôve been using this app to since 2014 and mainly for the Plans! I never leave reviews but I have to say, Nike has downgraded this app! I just completed the 6 weeks collection program and was HIGHLY annoyed that whoever created this new feature didn‚Äôt have enough sense to even mark off the workouts or weeks! It look like Nike just throw these workouts on the app. The Plans tracked my weeks and days for me and seeing the green check next to the workout was both rewarding and motivating! Not only did the Plans include mobility workouts, it forced/help me to get into yoga. Now in the Collection it‚Äôs an option that I have to remember to scroll down and look for while remembering what week I‚Äôm on because Nike took that feature off! And I can‚Äôt believe someone didn‚Äôt think to check these workouts off or to label the weeks. That is the most annoying thing about the new Collection! 
 
Nike, please make the Plans available again and let your users choose between the Plans or Collections. Taking the Plans completely off was a bad move!
*****BRING THE PLANS BACK NIKE******"	positive
2672	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	"NTC is one of my favorite apps and I use it at least 4 times per week. The workouts are great, the coaching program is my favorite since it forces me to be accountable to myself, and the addition of yoga workouts has been a nice surprise. 

With that being said, there are a few things that could be improved:

Time-based vs rep based workouts: on rep-based workouts, there are built in rest times. On the time-based workouts, NTC automatically tells you when that rest is done. In the rep-based ones, however, you need to keep track yourself on your phone and check off when the time is done. It should be possible to have that rest count down automatically. 

Music selection: the music selection interface is a little clunky

Apple Watch interpretation: This is my biggest need for improvement. Admittedly, I may be caring way to much about my Move calorie counting score on my watch, but the NTC app continuously overrides the calories burned during a workout that‚Äôs tracked by my watch and replaces it with the estimated calories from the NTC app. Considering the watch has a heart rate monitor, I assume that its calorie counter is more accurate than the NTC estimate. It‚Äôs pretty disappointing to finish a workout, have my watch tell me that I completed my goal for the day, and then NTC rolls back my calories burned for the day a few hours later."	positive
2673	301521403	health_and_fitness	4	I love this app a lot, but one day I accidentally deleted my plan, and then I logged out to see if my plan might come back, and  all my workouts I did on that plan including extra ones and all my minutes were gone. ( I had 240 minuets of workouts ) instead the app now said that I started a new plan, did only 3 workouts, and completed it. In October of 2017. Not only did I not get the app then, I have never done that plan and those 3 workouts. I am very disappointed to see all my progress loss, and although I very much enjoy all the workouts and the style of the app, I hated to see all my activity be ‚Äò Thrown in the garbage‚Äô  I jus want to know if this is a glitch, and if you can some how reverse it. However this won‚Äôt stop me from using the app, I would even recommend it. The only thing I worry about is my experience happening to other people. Thanks if you read my review, and if you are on the brink of getting this app, you will in no way regret it :)	negative
2674	301521403	health_and_fitness	4	I have been working out by following this app for a year. I love it. It has everything that I need and I want. I always recommend it to my friends and family. Please look into the following tiny problem to make it a even better one: 1. The alarm for switching sides is gone, and it is a big bug to me, since I would like to focus on my practice rather than the app screen. 2. The sync between different device and running+ sometimes does work well 3. I logged in my NTC, worked out for almost 4000 minutes, then I restored my IPad, AND everything is gone, Everything is gone! Now I feel like I never work out for those 4000 minutes. But I still love it, so I registered with a new ID and started again. I do wish I could get those 4000 minutes record back though. Thanks! I have to say I love the old version more, the new app changed everything all at once, I wish it had been changed gradually.	positive
2675	301521403	health_and_fitness	4	"This app has done more good for me than I could‚Äôve ever expected. I‚Äôve been able to start making a habit of exercising, and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve never had before. You‚Äôve done a great job Nike. 
And yes, while I am a bit disappointed that plans were removed (and wouldn‚Äôt be against them coming back), collections do their job good enough. It doesn‚Äôt feel as personal, but I at least have to do a set amount of reps in collections, rather than as many as I can in a set time limit like I did with plans. 
My only issue is that I‚Äôve noticed that my workouts aren‚Äôt fully tracked on my Apple Watch. Sure, they‚Äôre tracked fully in the app, but not in the Health app I have it connected to, nor my Cardiogram app. I‚Äôm not certain if it‚Äôs my fault, but I‚Äôve noticed it happening over the past few workouts. I‚Äôll check again after I workout tomorrow, and if it‚Äôs my fault I‚Äôll give five stars.
All in all, I highly recommend this app."	positive
2676	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	I have tried for years to attend classes, work with trainers, etc. at many different facilities. I have a gym quality treadmill bike weights at home too.... nothing compares to NTC!! I‚Äôve dropped 30 pounds and gained strength, flexibility, stability I haven‚Äôt had for years trying to do it on my own. The workouts are challenging and balanced. I never stretched before and rarely had the variety in every workout. My Plan truly is tailored to ME, my goals, and my equipment, etc. This is the real thing and a Godsend for me. Just like the slogan says, all you have to do is tell the NTC app what you want, then, Just Do It!!! If it wasn‚Äôt for the Kaepernick thing Nike would be batting 1000 in my book, so if you were going to fall short on anything, better that, than NTC, NRC, the shoes, the clothes, or the gear!!! Thanks for all of your hard work Nike!!! Nike works for me so I can work to achieve a better me toward my best self!	positive
2677	301521403	health_and_fitness	3	I started using this app about 7 months ago. I loved it. I really liked how you can follow along, it times you, still plays your music etc. I love structure so I liked picking a workout collection. I was in the middle of doing the ‚Äú6 week get lean‚Äù workout collection, which was great and gave me a variety of workouts to do. However, suddenly out of nowhere it was gone. The number of workout collections is now minimal and maybe are ‚Äúall levels or beginner‚Äù or they only have about 12 workouts to add to cardio. I was very disappointed that they removed this feature because it was great for those who wanted to follow a workout schedule, which is why I gave the app 3 stars because now it is more time consuming to select a variety of workouts you want to do on a daily and make sure they are all different to come up with your own workout plan. And the premium workout plans they provide do not give a preview of the workouts so you don‚Äôt know if it is something you wouldn‚Äôt want to do or not.	positive
2678	301521403	health_and_fitness	3	"Great app but going through growing pain seems like! I have the paid premium version:
Pros:
- Great variation and style of workouts and instructors 
- Great core/ab workout built into most exercises. 
-Great user interface on the app, very crisp and engaging, love the app design and the whole idea and concept of this app
-great for home workout and limited equipments
-reasonable premium price 

Cons:
-very problematic playback (if you use another app (text message, musics, etc) while a workout video is playing  and come back to this app it pushes and buffers for ever and almost impossible to restart and forced me to close the workout and reopen and that makes it count as I finished one workout and I‚Äôm doing it for the second time. Same thing happens if I want to skip forwards or backwards!! 
-limited workout plans/programs 
-no way to rate or see ratings of individual workouts or programs (so kinda have to try each or guess to see if you like them)
-no option to customize plans/programs (either you do the whole program or not which let me to do some parts of a program and skip some or just end it before program is finished which is very disappointing)
-poor nutrition plan (essentially it‚Äôs blogging about nutrition and there‚Äôs no actual ‚Äúplan‚Äù certainly no individualized nutrition plan or even anything close to it)
-Random notifications from app that‚Äôs promoting Nike products (on paid version of app!)
Hope they work on perfecting this app!!"	positive
2679	301521403	health_and_fitness	4	I love this app for quick and dirty at-home workouts. However, it needs a ‚ÄúMy Workouts‚Äù feature or something similar where you can save your favorite workouts, or a tab where you can go to see the workouts you‚Äôve downloaded or just the ability to ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù workouts. Surprised they haven‚Äôt come up with this feature yet. It‚Äôd be a lot easier and less time consuming for me to find a workout to do if I could save them under a tab or even on different lists. I think it‚Äôd be great if you could create personalized workout lists, like ‚ÄúWorkouts to try‚Äù or ‚ÄúCardio‚Äù, or even if the app had those lists or features built in somehow. Maybe they have something like this in the Premium version that I don‚Äôt know about; if they did, it‚Äôd be incentive for me to buy it (if only it were a one-time fee and not one of those annoying monthly subscription fees...most of us are already paying for a gym).	positive
2680	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	"This app is really excellent for people who don‚Äôt have a gym membership, and for those who are wanting to get into working out. (I can‚Äôt speak for hardcore fitness people because I‚Äôm not one of them.)

The huge appeal of it for me is that the app has entire workouts already made for you. You can search for a type of workout (HIIT, yoga, etc.) or for a body section for your workout (full body, legs, arms); the app then provides a set of exercises with video examples and a voice that guides you through the motions.

Another cool feature of the app (which is why it‚Äôs great without a gym membership) is that there are tons of no-equipment workouts that are still crazy strenuous. There are obviously parts of the body you can work better with equipment than without it (hello, back muscles!), but for people who don‚Äôt want to pay for exercise equipment, this is an awesome alternative."	positive
2681	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	I am 61 years old. I needed to find a way to incorporate fitness into my routine, especially as I aged. I slowed down, my knees hurt, I put on weight. I needed to form good habits and this app helped me do that. Once I found the app, I immediately signed up for the premium version and it is worth every penny. I worried about how my knees would hold up and they have done well. As a matter of fact, strengthening my leg muscles has improved the overall stability of my knees. The instructors always show modifications for the exercises, to accommodate those with fitness levels below or above the exercises. I just completed a 4 week program and feel great. I am doing exercises that at the beginning of the program I never thought I‚Äôd do. The sleep and nutrition articles are great. Highly, highly recommend. You will work hard and you‚Äôll get stronger. My knee has ‚Äúlocked up‚Äù for 2 weeks!	positive
2682	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	Honestly I really enjoyed this app.  A reason I liked it was because you have a video example for every move done in the workout.  It is also set up so that you can download workouts if you know you won‚Äôt have service or wifi.  The only thing that is really a bummer is that you have to get premium (have to pay) to do their workout programs.  The programs are basically having a trainer train you over a course of multiple weeks.  I would recommend for the app to have a few free programs, so people can see if they want to spend their money on it or not.  Something else that I think people should know is that there‚Äôs a variety of lengths of workouts. There are also workouts created and/or done by athletes and celebrities, which I think is pretty cool.  But, like I said in the beginning I really did like this app.	positive
2683	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	I've been into fitness as long as I can remember. I've gone to a gym and worked out since I was in middle school, played tennis in high school, and taken every type of workout class there is. My point is - I know fitness. So take it from me that this app is great! I am extremely sore from yesterday's workout as I type this reviewüòµ which is a great thing for me! I am currently trying to use the gym at my apt instead of paying for a monthly membership. I find it hard some days to just get in there and get a good work out in. But with the NTC app, I feel like I'm in a workout class without the sweat from the dude next to me hitting me in the leg. The instructional clips and voice over are great and very motivating! The app also allows you to select the type of physique you're trying to achieve and gives you an entire work out plan for the week. GET OUT THERE AND SWEAT, PEEPS! üí¶	positive
2684	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	I can‚Äôt even believe this app is free! I‚Äôve been using it for months now and have logged in almost 500 minutes (I don‚Äôt work out as much as I should). But this app keeps track of how long you workout and which workouts you do. After each workout it tells you how many calories you burned and let‚Äôs you select the level at which you hit it or how hard it was to you. Keeps track of your workout habits and even where you‚Äôre doing your workouts. Also, although I haven‚Äôt used this part yet, it allows you to enter in your own workouts that you create or whatever. So you don‚Äôt have to just do their workouts (even though there‚Äôs plenty available). Overall this is just a fantastic app, and the fact that it‚Äôs free is a total mindblower for me. I haven‚Äôt had to pay an expensive gym fee in months! Thank you NIKE!!!	positive
2685	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	I love to work out! But it‚Äôs always hard to know what to do when your doing it by yourself.! A friend actually recommended this app to me and it saved me I was so tired of just trying to come up with things to do to to keep my abs and to keep me strong. I used to do Competitive gymnastics and that was a workout so I never had to really watch what I eat or how much I workout because I would everyday when I was there. I quit earlier this year due to some stress and this app has helped so much to keep me in shape!!! I am 13 and do a lot of sports so it helps keep me strong for those too.!! It might sound weird that I‚Äôm a 13 year old and I‚Äôm writing all this but I‚Äôm dead serious this app really helped me!! I love how it shows you what to do and you can chose any type of workout you want to do from just a workout to yoga üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è!! Anyways I LOVE this app!	positive
2686	301521403	health_and_fitness	3	"Not sure why, but recently, I have incessantly been prompted by the NTC app to set my language, and the only option it offers is Chinese. I‚Äôm an expat living in a Chinese-speaking country, but I don‚Äôt want to be forced into reading Chinese on my apps. I have to force-quit the NTC app to get out of the prompt.

The other annoying thing is that there‚Äôs no ‚Äúlock screen‚Äù feature or a way to play the workouts with your screen off. I don‚Äôt always need the workout video playing to know how to do the drill: stop forcing me to have to play the video on-screen to continue my workout. The second-best option would be to offer a ‚Äúlock screen‚Äù feature so that accidental screen touches while it‚Äôs in my pocket don‚Äôt skip around the workout.

The Watch app does absolutely nothing: it just stays on a black screen with white text that just reads, ‚ÄúTime to train‚Äù even though I have gone through the Apple Watch setup process in the iOS app."	negative
2687	301521403	health_and_fitness	3	"When I was using this app for free, 5 stars. But I paid $15 for a month of the new premium version and will probably cancel it. I‚Äôm a personal trainer myself, so I geek out over the new advanced workouts (particularly Ryan Flaherty‚Äôs), but otherwise am underwhelmed. Biggest red flag is that some of the video ‚Äútips‚Äù (e.g ‚Äúimportance of warming up‚Äù) in the program have no sound on my phone. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is a bug because some of them work and some of them don‚Äôt. For $15/month, there can‚Äôt be technical issues like that.

Other thing I don‚Äôt love is the high number of workouts that are only offered in class live video format. If I‚Äôm at home, I love following along with the trainer, but at the gym, I need a whiteboard format. More often than not I‚Äôm working out at the gym and I‚Äôm not going to set my phone up and try to follow along in that setting. It would be great to have a written version of the video workouts for times when video is not possible."	positive
2688	301521403	health_and_fitness	1	"This app and Nike run club should be integrated. The coaching plans should include run and working out options. Plus with the resources available to Nike and apple plus their investment in each other‚Äôs success of the Nike Apple Watch one would think that they could create an app that was comprehensive yet focused with some appreciation for experience the people actually using the device would have.

 For example.  you can run with NRC. You can stretch NTC. And they are not linked in any manner that works so you go in and out each time. In addition, the watch is useless during this phase and with NTC all together. How it doesn‚Äôt mirror the video on the iPhone is beyond me. In addition, once you get ready to track your run using the Nike watch which you purchased for This sole purpose you are sent a warning that it is better to start the tracking from your phone. 

I like to borderline love the NRC. Especially the guided runs (which should have clear explanation in addition to a catchy title). However, NTC shows us what the app could be and what is sadly missing."	positive
2689	301521403	health_and_fitness	3	"I happily paid for premium for a couple of months. I completed a 24 class Program. Unfortunately, now that I‚Äôm done, the app instructs me to try another program, or repeat the one I just did. There are only 5 programs and one of them is yoga. All the programs have different focuses (speed, weights) and are ‚Äútaught‚Äù by different instructors. I‚Äôm not looking to change the way I workout every 6 weeks.  Imagine if every six weeks a new coach showed up and you‚Äôve been working on building muscle and the new instructor is like no more weights let‚Äôs work on flexibility.  Well that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening here.
The app also has Workouts, so you can  go the gym and randomly filter for say a 45 minute workout. But those workouts are just taken directly from the programs. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre coming up with new workouts every day. 
Whatever you see offered in the app now is all the workouts they have. This is not a long term solution."	positive
2690	301521403	health_and_fitness	4	"In the midst of my workout, the app through my Apple Watch will tell me I‚Äôm burning a certain amount (seems like a pretty accurate measurement, might I add) of calories and then once I finish the workout, it‚Äôs says I‚Äôve burned only a third of that amount in total! It says it in the Activity app, the Nike app on the phone, and on the watch! My Activity app at least recognizes my effort through the rings but for example, I burned roughly 300 active calories on my most recent workout (according to the watch while the workout was still going), but when I look at my stats, it says my active calories was only 75 calories for 30 minutes?
Because my Activity app still picked it up regardless, I‚Äôm not too annoyed, I just want the Nike app to accurately measure my workouts from beginning to end. Otherwise, GREAT app with very helpful and challenging workouts!"	positive
2691	301521403	health_and_fitness	3	"I've been doing workouts with Nike for 10 years. Started out just running but the NTC app has been great for motivating me to do other kinds of training. There's a workout for everyone, and having workouts shorter than 10 minutes allows me to fit in a workout when I might otherwise skip it altogether due to time restrictions.

Been very satisfied with the app until this latest update. Now I can no longer see my accumulated workout stats under my profile. That's 10 years of stats--gone. Under the activity tab i can see the workout stats for what I've done with NTC, but I want to see my historic stats. Incidentally, I can't see the workout stats for my friends now either, and that's part of how we kept each other accountable. Please fix this. And I'll second what others have said about including apple watch support. 

Fix the historic stats problem and I'll  submit an updated review."	positive
2692	301521403	health_and_fitness	1	I just downloaded the app, signed up with Facebook, put in my password, etc, then immediately got an error message telling me I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot eligible for registration‚Äù? I‚Äôm an adult (it asks for your birthdate), and I know my Facebook nor email have any issues, so I tried again, thinking I‚Äôll just sign up without Facebook. I‚Äôm immediately given another error message ‚ÄúNot eligible for registration due to unsuccessful attempts‚Äù. I tried Once? Started to try twice? The error message included a link to customer support, which I clicked on. My issue was not in any of the stock questions (not that they would‚Äôve helped me anyway, I need some sort of administrator reset or an equivalent). So I called the number they gave for app issues (and the only option is to call), and I get thrown into a waiting line and told it will be 30-45 minutes. I‚Äôm not sitting around waiting for 45 minutes for an app that I haven‚Äôt even been granted the privilege to look at yet. Never had an issue with new logins in my life and nothing has changed, so I know it‚Äôs not me.	negative
2693	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	"I started using NTC right after it was released and appreciated the workout formats and variety. I only stopped using the app because it was too effective - i realized that my arms were getting ~too~ bulky, if that were a thing for strong women!

Now we‚Äôre in the lockdown and I was in search of home training programs. Yes, Premium is free right now, but I can see why people would want to pay for it. Old format workouts are still available, but Premium programs have me looking forward to working out (after working from home) at the end of the day. 

 I‚Äôve been recommending this to all my friends looking to work out at home as well. I‚Äôve tried a variety of workout apps over the years and for some reason keep coming back to this one - I feel stronger, sore-er, and more motivated to exercise again!"	positive
2694	301521403	health_and_fitness	2	"The update added a lot of premium workouts however a lot of them I actually find worse in structure than the free ones. There free ones have clips on how to do an exercise as it comes up, the premium workouts however are just writing and then you have to click on the videos and then on the video of the exercise to see the movement which isn‚Äôt very practical at all at disrupts the workout. Other premium workouts are trainer led which I don‚Äôt love but also don‚Äôt hate, however for those workouts you can‚Äôt check which exercises the workout will involve which is something I‚Äôd like to know before starting the workout. The Patrick Frost body weight workouts are however a great addition, I‚Äôve always been quite interested in that type of movement and it isn‚Äôt easy to find in other workout apps. 
Also they removed all free plans from the app and the premium plans are quite limited. 
So basically the recent updates made the app worse."	positive
2695	301521403	health_and_fitness	1	"Updating my review since the new premium NTC version came out.  Although premium seems to have brought back a paid version of the plans, all the workouts are streaming instead of downloadable, so my iPhone keeps rendering and stopping throughout the workout.  I also have pretty solid internet service so not sure what‚Äôs up, but I can‚Äôt even get through 5 minutes of the first workout, plus when I pause to tinker with the app, it concludes the workout and I have to start all over.  Nightmare. Please bring pack the plans. They were succinct and to the point.  I have no need to listen to trainers and their introductions every single time I want to workout. 

Last review....

I recommended this app to countless people because of the plan feature. Collections are limited, and could be better used as a supplemental feature.  The plans were tailored to each individual, with duration and difficulty.  Hard to understand why Nike would remove the most useful feature within the entire app.  Guess I‚Äôm going back to the gym..."	positive
2696	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	I love working out, but really wanted to find an app that motivated me to workout and not worry about the equipment or classes I needed to join. Honestly, I did most of these workouts it my own house throughout my day. The app has a great versatility. I really enjoyed it. The app has really great guided workouts for beginners, as well as intermediate and high level. While experimenting with the app, I experienced some easily surpassable difficulties signing in. Once I was in, I started immediately. The workouts were great (I was sore after!) and the voice overs were helpful. They were guided and structures so I didn't have to worry about timing them. Nike did a great job with this app. Honestly, FitBit or Apple Watch compatibility would be so cool. If the gym scares you, USE THIS APP! It is a great alternative for the gym and motivates you to get in shape.	positive
2697	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	"I have upgraded to premium (annual subscription). Using the app every day makes it penny per day so I don‚Äôt understand the complaints from users. Nike is a business and they need to make money. I assume the incoming revenue will allow them to continue investing in further improvements and workouts/plans. The whiteboard feature is great. My suggested improvements:
1. Provide the option to choose class or whiteboard feature for given workouts.
2. I am a 57 year old male and would love to see workouts/plans geared towards boomers with workouts conducted by folks from same age group. Many of your customers are 50+
3. Sport specific plans with Golf being my top choice.
Thank you for your great work. I have owned some Nike stock for many years and the gains more than cover the expenses for your products üòÉ"	positive
2698	301521403	health_and_fitness	4	"I used to use this app so much and it truly helped me get into the best shape I‚Äôve ever been (I got abs!!). I felt so good about myself and the major improvements in my body that the app had helped me achieve. 

That being said, I made all of my health gains using the plans. Having the plans made me feel more committed to exercising since there was a layout and schedule already made for me that was personalized for me (or it at least felt like it was) and I could easily work with the already organized program to fit my personal schedule. The collections don‚Äôt motivate me to workout anymore because the process of having to organize the workouts and fit it into my schedule just feels like too much work. Call me lazy, but plans made it so much easier to just follow a guide which let me focus on exercising. Amazing app, just bring back plans!"	positive
2699	301521403	health_and_fitness	5	NTC is not only super organized and very aesthetically pleasing to the eye, it is also incredibly useful. it has helped me get back to going to the gym full time, and it‚Äôs work out plans and reminders for me keep me accountable on a daily basis. the exercise routines are enormously abundant and diverse, ranging from circuits to weights to yoga to running. And, on top of that, the workouts also can be done offline after downloaded and have super motivational and informative background sound as well as animated graphics of real people doing the exercise so you don‚Äôt get lost.  this is hands down my favorite app. the only thing i would recommend to users is to invest in bluetooth headphones with the app in order to hear instruction and workout shifts. wearing cord headphones gets really messy and really inconvenient really quickly.	positive

2701	1361619409	health_and_fitness	5	I usually don‚Äôt purchase fitness apps and I normally don‚Äôt do yoga unless it‚Äôs the basic stretching from home. This app is the easiest to follow and I love that she shows you the exercise first and speaks slowly and then does the reps with you while continuing to talk and guide. I have always wanted to do something like yoga to become more fit and lean, and this mixed with a few at home workouts during quarantine, I hope really pays off. I quit drinking alcohol yesterday and plan to see what I can achieve after a month. Trying to find balance mentally and physically and I think with this app I will find it and look forward to the next workout. Not to mention the food/meal/snack options on here are quick easy to find in stores and not too expensive to prep and sound delicious! Definitely worth the money spent even though I‚Äôm not working and can‚Äôt afford it. My mental health and being body conscious is worth every penny to me! Thanks YOGA-GO!!!	positive
2702	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	Ive reset my phone several times to make sure it‚Äôs not the one malfunctioning but it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs the app. The exercises are good but agree with several users that it doesn‚Äôt allow you to review the exercises to make sure you are doing them correctly. If you do, you have to go back to the beginning. It doesn‚Äôt track the workouts correctly. The workouts state they are 10 minutes long but then one of the screens states I‚Äôve done 20 minutes worth which is not true. Can‚Äôt review workouts beforehand without them registering to my iPhone and making it appear like I‚Äôve worked out when all I‚Äôve done is review them. Doesn‚Äôt recommend a warm up so I understood I didn‚Äôt have to. Big mistake. I‚Äôm stuck with it because I didn‚Äôt cancel within the time I should have. ‚òπÔ∏è	positive
2703	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	I used this app a couple of times and purchased a 1 year subscription to it. I then got busy during the holidays and didn‚Äôt use it for a couple of weeks. When I went back to start using it again it made me setup all my data again and wanted me to pay again. I went down to the tiny link at the bottom to restore purchase and it said my subscription was paid for but there was some error restoring purchase and to try again later. I tried again a few days later and then a week later. Still no restore!! So apparently I‚Äôve just given the developers $53 for nothing!!	negative
2704	1361619409	health_and_fitness	5	This is the best and easiest full body workout to fit into a busy schedule.   Short (approx. 10 minute) workouts got me in the habit with exercises that worked different muscle groups without being too difficult.  I was encouraged and kept going back every day.   It was Easy to add 10 minutes to my busy schedule now I find 30 minutes every day and I feel better too!	positive
2705	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	I never actually used this app because it immediately wanted payment without a free trial. How do I know if I like it enough to pay $65 for the forever package? And I don‚Äôt want to pay $15 for a month and then another $65. That‚Äôs already a lot of money. I highly suggest a free trial for two weeks so I can see if it‚Äôs worth that much money. Like that‚Äôs a lot of money too. I would recommend a lower price anyway. But if you‚Äôre going to charge that much for a workout app (when I can easily go to a dance class instead) then I would recommend letting me try it out before I buy it. Sell me the product before I pay for it.	positive
2706	1361619409	health_and_fitness	2	The ad on Facebook showed a series of daily exercise and diet goals, like one day was drink 2 liters of water, no soda or sugar, get 10,000 steps, do xx exercise move. I thought that would be fun to try on sequester but the actual app has nothing like that that I can find and you don‚Äôt know that til you‚Äôve paid. I‚Äôm going to use it for a month and will update my rating based on what it does do but I wish I had gone to the App Store to review the screenshots first ‚Äî they look nothing like the ads. My bad.	negative
2707	1361619409	health_and_fitness	2	Couldn‚Äôt find a place to directly contact the developer so I‚Äôm hoping this works. I bought the app but then when I try to log on it asks for payment again. On the bottom below the prices it had ‚Äúrestore subscription‚Äù and I click that and it tells me my subscription was successfully purchased but there is an issue and to try again later. Got this app about three days ago and I still haven‚Äôt been able to get on. Any ideas/help?	positive
2708	1361619409	health_and_fitness	5	The workout/stretching is very easy to do along with the visual aid of how to do things properly. Another lovely feature is how quick it is. I can easily get it done without having to wasting time in my busy day. Plus, it‚Äôs great to do once I wake up to feel more energized for the rest of my day.	positive
2709	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	I am not a fan of fitness apps. As I like the concept of Yoga I purchased this for one month. I needed it only for one month as I person who often forgets to remove automated payments, I cancelled by subscription after my payment. I have to be using this app for a month without any issues as I paid for one month. As I tried to watch intense workouts or anything it is locked. I am disappointed even though I paid for one month I am not able to use the app for whatever reasons I want to....	negative
2710	1361619409	health_and_fitness	5	I am an exercise app and yoga sceptic. But I have run out of options as far as fitness. I am really happy with Yoga-go. I like the simple beginning workouts that are challenging but achievable. I also like that they have suggested meal plans. There are three choices of plans, 1 month, 1 year, and forever.	positive
2711	1361619409	health_and_fitness	5	Love this app. Just the right combination of yoga and workout, do-able, follow-able, repeat-able.

Thank you, Yoga-Go!	positive
2712	1361619409	health_and_fitness	5	I work a lot, and I love Yoga Go as the workouts are amazing and only last 8-40 minutes a day- depends which one u are doing. But my body definitely feels those workouts and It‚Äôs just so perfect and easy so I use it twice daily	positive

2714	1361619409	health_and_fitness	5	It may seem expensive but it gives meal planning in addition to target workouts for 10,20, and 30 min!!! I like that I can do a short workout multiple times per day life allowing	positive
2715	1361619409	health_and_fitness	4	I wanted to use this on my iPad but because I downloaded it on my iPhone I can‚Äôt use it without re-purchasing it... what a bummer. My devices have the same Apple ID so it‚Äôs too bad that this app only allows one device per purchase.	negative
2716	1361619409	health_and_fitness	4	I love the app and how short the workouts are while still feeling the burn in your muscles. I wish there was an option to flip back to a previous day on the meal plan or maybe be able to save my favorite recommended ones	positive
2717	1361619409	health_and_fitness	3	I like how short the workouts are and you can definitely feel them the next day. The app keeps saying I didn‚Äôt do workouts I already have done so I keep repeating them so it gets checked off and it still isn‚Äôt checking it off .	positive
2718	1361619409	health_and_fitness	5	I‚Äôm loving having quick workouts before I go to work. Getting a good 15-20 minute workout in right when I wake up helps me feel centered and ready for the day.	positive
2719	1361619409	health_and_fitness	5	I work out a couple of times a week and walk a couple miles most days. I love this app! I use it either in the middle of the afternoon or before bed for a good stretch and reboot.	positive

2721	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	The App stalls mid-workout and you have to quit and exit to return to the exercise. Then, it doesn‚Äôt remember your progress so you have to start from the beginning. There is no app support and the ‚Äúyour account t‚Äù section doesn‚Äôt provide you the ability to cancel or unsubscribe. I have tried to cancel by emailing the app support store with no luck.

2724	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	I purchased this app for a one year subscription. Complete rip off!! It only opens the first exercise and prompts you to pay again. Claims family sharing but there‚Äôs no sign in and again prompts for more charges. The available videos are horrible quality. Attempting to get my money back. I feel completely ripped off and robbed. Shame on you Yoga-Go	negative
2725	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	First they get you to buy in this app for $30, and when you actually try to sign in- the process starts all over and then they ask you to pay again.  I did not see any workouts or meal plan.  This is a scam.  Why is there only 1 actual review written and it‚Äôs also 1 star.  Do not buy this.  Just wasted 30 min of my time.	negative
2726	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	I saw this app on another site and when I went to check it out, it immediately wanted me to start the workout with me now knowing a single thing about the cost.

2727	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	I tried for 7 days but then I was charged for one year. I don‚Äôt want it, I just what for more one month.

Thank you	positive
2728	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	I can not seem to get past the purchase option. I do not want to purchase this. All I wanted was to have a yoga/workout app and it will not allow me to use it without purchasing an subscription. In order to use the app does it require me to purchase a subscription because if so I do not want it!!	negative
2729	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	I paid for the entire year and was sent the receipt. After a month, my 30 day exercise record was lost, and I had to pay again to reactivate. Hopefully this app is not a scam, and this message gets a response because my note did not.	positive

2734	1361619409	health_and_fitness	1	I‚Äôve just downloaded the app which showed no cost. It does mention in app charges but that‚Äôs usually for some add ons.

When I upload a bunch of photos at one time, I sometimes get the error ""No Wifi"" when I am in my office and have great Wifi.  So I am not sure what to say about that.  However, having these photos now connect i.e. Camera spot 1 to 2 to 3 and so on and editing the direction that is shown as the thumbnail prior to uploading so you are giving the best view / direction of the 360 is fantastic.  Then taking it a step further and editing the listing to match you GPS pin point location in Google Map and adding the parking location.  Now this bring the service to the public to a whole new level.  The new roll out of GSV and Google Maps is truly exciting.  Data Fuels the Cannon, Technology Ignites It."	positive

Until you publish it. You can press select and try to change the place but at the bottom, the pic is just white so you can‚Äôt see the pic. This is a lot and I‚Äôm guessing nobody understood this.

2754	904418768	travel	1	I am a high school teacher who invested time and money while traveling the world taking 360 images for my students that I uploaded to Google Street View for them to experience in VR mode. I purchased Google Cardboard viewers and created a number of lessons for the classroom. Last August when prepping for the new year I noticed that the VR option resulted in a black screen only. I deleted the app and reinstalled a number of times. I reached out to Google. I received questions about what version I was using. I noticed many other frustrated educators doing the same. It is now November 2019. Crickets. We have heard nothing and nothing is fixed. Complete lack of communication. Spare yourself if you are looking for VR feature. It is incredibly disheartening that Google has dropped the ball and left teachers high and dry.	negative

I was too eager and installed it as soon as I saw it in App Store. But the app is unresponsive and keeps crashing.

It worked only once and I saw a view of some Astronomical Lab that was on home page by default. However the app went unresponsive and kept crashing just after that. I can't imagine the app could be so crappy on iPhone X running 11.2.1 (latest).

I'm highly disappointed with Google Street View. Please fix the bugs and release a better version. I'm not uninstalling it hoping there will be an update. I will come back and edit this review if the app starts working again."	negative

I‚Äôm so frustrated, and would be even moreso if I weren‚Äôt beaten down with nihilism.

The app keeps flipping axes e.g. it starts in the portrait orientation but wen u search for a location, it flips to landscape on its own. It gives you tips on how to use the 360 functionality and wen to swipe but the ‚Äúgot it‚Äù button is off screen and I can‚Äôt scroll to get to it. I couldn‚Äôt get out of the tip screen so I had to close the app.	negative

The current version is broken on iOS 12, losing the ability to read the metadata in an upload that establishes the view direction and losing the ability to manually reset the view direction using a preview image. Google seems to assume that the user is too stupid to notice, and doesn‚Äôt care if they do, because there is no user support anyway. Street View wasn‚Äôt generating enough revenue to sustain it so Google walked away, demonstrating its usual corporate ADHD. Expect this app to not even open with some future iOS.	negative
2761	904418768	travel	4	"13 Jun 2019 update: images work again, so it‚Äôs actually usable again.  If anyone at Google reads this: thanks for the fix!

15 May 2019: Not sure when user-submitted spherical views stopped working, but I get nothing but black screens and spinners in this app and when looking at images in Google Maps, both on my iPhone and iPad (iOS 12.2 and 12.3).  

I see others with the same issues when searching the Google support pages, including those using brand new Windows laptops (running IE, Chrome, and Firefox).

No solutions in anything I found.  Only place I‚Äôve seen user-submitted images work is when accessing through the Safari app on iOS (a very clunky workaround at best).  Will increase my rating and update this review when resolved."	positive

I would like to know if you will be creating  a 360 video application with ability to capture the footage and actually be able to upload from an iOS device?

2763	904418768	travel	4	I have a phone with a small screen. Their mandatory tabs on the bottom take up about 30% of the screen, and the stuff on top takes another 20%. And the mandatory stuff on the bottom is usually stuff I don‚Äôt want. The only reason I use this app is to make spherical pictures. The interface is unenviable but I don‚Äôt know of any other app that takes and stitches spherical pictures.	positive
2764	904418768	travel	5	I love this app for its ability to take sort of flawless 360 photos. I have been using it very frequently on my iPhone for the past few months. All of a sudden this app started to freeze and became unresponsive and finally crashes after a few minutes. Hoping that Google will push an update soon with a fix.	positive
2765	904418768	travel	3	"Hey, Google

If I type in an address. I just want you to get the street view in front of that house. Don‚Äôt suggest near by homes or anything else. Why would you not just put me, the little orange man, and my screen directly in front of the address I input? I get it, this is a first world problems rant and I should just let this go. It‚Äôs let go. Thank you for this platform to get silly things off my chest. I still like the app because I can‚Äôt do what satellites can do.  3 stars."	positive
2766	904418768	travel	2	Since the latest update, all photos from my iPhone XS are uploaded at low resolution and rejected by Google. I have read that this is a critical flaw according to many other iPhone XS users. Worse still, all files appear to lose resolution and become low quality the moment you upload them. I am sitting on dozens of spheres that I cannot publish because doing so ruins the file. It seems as though leaving this app until this problem is addressed is the only thing that makes sense.	negative
2767	904418768	travel	1	I admit I may not have given this a chance.  But what I wanted was to see street views of places.  Isn‚Äôt that sort of the point?  It seems like that should be the first and easiest thing you see when you open this app.  But the interface was not only completely non-intuitive, so I couldn‚Äôt figure out what the heck I was doing, AND it refused to rotate out of portrait view with any rhyme or reason, but it kept showing me pictures of things I didn‚Äôt want to see that overlapped what I was trying to look at.  So as I said, after 1/2 hour of futzing with it, I deleted it.	positive
2768	904418768	travel	2	"I love Google Earth and Street View using the PC or Mac app.  The mobile app is not in the same league ... yet.

The most glaring omission is the lack of a way to bookmark a location to come back to it later. After much exploration I found the ruins of my great-grandfather‚Äôs house in Ireland, but I‚Äôd have to go hunting all over if I want to see it again.

The solution seems obvious: allow saving of placemarks in a shareable location, so PC, Mac, and mobile could all use the same set of saved placemarks!"	positive
2769	904418768	travel	3	Great app and I love being a contributor! Three stars because the app doesn‚Äôt seem to interface with iOS 13 or iPhone 11 very well - not sure which is the culprit. Phone ‚Äústares‚Äù at the red dot for an extended period of time and never takes the picture. Sometimes you can complete a photo sphere but often you have to revisit the same dot several times - even if it turns white often it won‚Äôt take a picture.	positive
2770	904418768	travel	3	I used this on a i pad and I could hardly even use the app. It‚Äôs because some blocks randomly stack up then cover the whole screen. When you click the search tab then something comes up and then you have to press got it hen it will do that again but you can‚Äôt even see the got it button so then you have to close the app I do not recommenced for I pad it even said it‚Äôs good for I pad and I phone.	positive
2771	904418768	travel	3	"I use the app to post images of my local area and soon I will post images in other areas.

The app allows me to upload my 360 degree images but if I try to connect them into a tour  no matter what I do or how many attempts I make to connect the images I get an error message that says an unspecified problem has arisen and I should try again. This is very disappointing and frustrating. 

I have qualified as a Trusted Google photographer and am very keen to consolidate my work with ‚ÄúTours‚Äù to connect with google maps etc.

I read other users have similar problems. I do appreciate the complexity of the programming but hope a resolution is found ASAP. Thanks Google for a great app and let it continue to develop and achieve bug free status !!!"	positive
2772	904418768	travel	1	Crashes when trying to save a panorama to phone on iPhone 6 and latest iOS. Do these guys test their product? There is literally no way for me to save the panorama I took only to link to it on google. If you try to save it the app crashes, tried on 3 different iPhone 6‚Äôs with different. Erosions of iOS 11 all crash. Idiotically no option to save photo from selection list only. Only way to save is to open photo and save after, which crashes the app.	positive
2773	904418768	travel	3	The app is actually pretty good. However it keeps crashing and makes me lose my progress. When I put the Save to Album button on and started to work, it crashed. I did the photos again and it won‚Äôt let me put them in my Google Drive. That‚Äôs because the button was off even though I turned it on. Please fix this!!!	positive
2774	904418768	travel	1	I loved it but had to stop using the app. I contributed with 55 photos that were viewed 3.4 million times. A lot of famous places in San Francisco have my panoramas as default when you search them. And I stopped creating them... The reason is simple, since the iOS updated to version 13.0, capturing stopped working. You see the circle, and nothing happens. The iOS 13 is out for four months. But developers seem don‚Äôt care about their top contributors. Ok, so do we.	positive
2775	904418768	travel	1	But it has been broken since August and nothing is being done to fix it. I have used this with a wide variety of classes and they have all thoroughly enjoyed it. Since at least August, when VR mode is launched, the screen goes black with a short white line in the bottom middle.  Please, for all of the educators who have invested in Cardboards not to mention time and resources for planning wonderful experiences for their students, please please please get this fixed!	positive
2776	904418768	travel	2	It‚Äôs a great app and I love the idea, but the design of the app is terrible. I don‚Äôt understand why there are always ‚Äúresults‚Äù appearing at the bottom of the screen, getting in the way of you map view. Also when you tap on a 360 picture, the information pops up automatically even after you tap the screen to get it off. If the app were a bit more organized and had a cleaner interface, 5 stars.	positive
2777	904418768	travel	4	I used to be able to save these photos to my phone but since this last time I updated, I can‚Äôt find that option. Since the name of the app overlaps with other google services, it‚Äôs hard to find help online with it. Wish it wasn‚Äôt called street view.	positive
2778	904418768	travel	1	I primarily use StreetView to upload pictures taken on my Ricoh S panorama camera to street view, using my iPad. Your options for importing pictures are ‚Äúimport them all now, including the ones you have no intention of posting‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat pictures?‚Äù The UI is non-responsive, scaled-up blurrily from an iPhone-appropriate resolution. Nothing works like you expect it to, if it works at all: attempts to navigate constantly cause interfering panels to slide in. Google should be ashamed of this app.	negative
2779	904418768	travel	2	Street view app crashes and unresponsive on both my iPhone 5s and iPhone 6 Plus. I have better response on my iPhone 5s but rather use my iPhone plus.

Super super super annoying for a google app to be so unresponsive.	positive

There are now these obnoxious ""suggestion cards"" that pop up constantly, covering over half the screen on my iPhone se.

2783	904418768	travel	3	Leaves a lot to be desired. Slow to register information. Not an easy user-interface to connect images. Silly that it only works on your phone app and can‚Äôt be completed on a desktop, which would be much easier. Not a bad app, just needs improved for easier UX.	positive
2784	904418768	travel	1	It deserves no stars at all. I found this app because i can no longer use streetview in either googlemaps on my ipad's browser or the maps app. This is even worse. I put in an address and the wheel just spins and the keyboard styas put like I haven't just clicked 'done'. Apparently google wants to choose what streets you view, because there are plenty of touristy options to look at. No google, that is not how it works.	negative

But now when I click on the button to go into VR mode, nothing happens. The screen goes black. It makes me sad. When will the app be updated with the glitch fixed? As I‚Äôve seen on the help forums for the app, this has been going on for a long time. I really want to use this app again. :(((	positive
2788	904418768	travel	1	The UI is terrible, it very unintuitive. I have to zoom around, swipe up, then scroll just to see your own photos. The app feels sluggish on an iPhoneXS max. The profile and private page should be part of the Hamburg menu similar to the contributions in google maps to it keeps constant. I share my photos from insta360 and then only sometimes show up in the app. I‚Äôd love to share my photos but this app makes it way to difficult	negative
2789	904418768	travel	1	I used this app about a year ago in school and it worked PERFECTLY. So, I decided to get my own, especially because my trip to Europe was cancelled due to the pandemic.

2790	904418768	travel	5	Even though I‚Äôm an iPhone user, this app runs so smoothly and I love contributing to the community with 360 degree shots. Wish more people would use and contribute so we could have some more ‚Äúcoverage‚Äù lol	positive
2791	904418768	travel	5	Google streets is nothing short of an amazing experience. I would suggest google streets to all my friends because it allows you to see what it‚Äôs like to be in a place without being in the place.	positive

2793	904418768	travel	1	After I uploaded more than 250 photos. None of photos appears in my profile any more. You can‚Äôt modify your photos after uploading like making face vague. It‚Äôs better if we can withdraw it and redo it. It‚Äôs impossible to edit location after you create a new location on google map. This app is nice when everything works but right now everything is broken.	negative
2794	904418768	travel	1	"If you actually want to use it to see the street view of something you need...forget it. The map itself is stuck behind tons of photos and notifications bugging you to do things like subscribe or connect your photos. You can't get them to go away. The map is virtually unviewable.  

All you can do with the app is to look at a bunch of other people‚Äôs random 360¬∞ photos...boring!"	positive
2795	904418768	travel	1	This app is always crashing and bugging out and there is absolutely no way to contact support to fix it besides providing ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù which I‚Äôm sure goes nowhere because they‚Äôve never once responded or fixed the issues.

2796	904418768	travel	2	"One the biggest annoyance is the mini map with address keeps on popping up every several seconds. You have to keep pulling it down. 

The second annoyance is it sometimes won't pick up very old addresses that Google Maps will. Nothing shows up at all in the search results. Shameful."	negative
2797	904418768	travel	4	Technology is both fantastic and scary. The things people are able to see is incredible in good ways and maybe even somewhat intrusive ways. But I believe most people use technology for positive things. Unbelievable as to what can be shared.	positive
2798	904418768	travel	4	This is really a great and smooth app for taking and saving 360 photos.

2800	904418768	travel	1	Why is there some tile taking up screen space for Uncle Bob‚Äôs photos? I just want to street view? If I click on Bob‚Äôs photos how do I go back? Thus should be intuitive.

You‚Äôre better than this Google. Focus on functionality.	negative
2801	529379082	travel	2	"When I got a Lyft and the driver‚Äôs car smelled absolutely disgusting, like vomit, I reached out to customer service to ask for a refund. It‚Äôs been almost a week and no one has gotten back to me. It‚Äôs also ridiculous that there is no public number or email to reach out to. You can only get help through the app and then you have to answer questions about your problem so you can be directed to an FAQ kind of answer. You‚Äôd have to click a vague option to get directed to a page where you can write to customer service. But then you‚Äôll probably never hear back. 

Today was the final straw. The map will show a few cars in my neighborhood and then when I request the ride, suddenly there‚Äôs only one car available and it‚Äôs all the way in a different borough. It says it‚Äôs 6 or 7 minutes away and then it keeps switching to ‚Äúa different driver‚Äù who is also in a different borough every 2 minutes and then it‚Äôs another ‚Äú7 minutes away.‚Äù It‚Äôs ridiculous that it would repeatedly connect me with drivers who are in different boroughs who aren‚Äôt actually willing to pick me up. This happens four times in a row and it needs to be fixed because I was going to be early for work and by the time I gave up on getting a Lyft and went with Uber instead, there was no way I could even get to work on time. With Uber, it said my ride was 4 minutes away and it actually came in 4 minutes instead of resetting over and over again with different drivers."	negative
2802	529379082	travel	5	Your app is not user-friendly. This is the first time I have it used Lyft. Trying to navigate to scheduling a ride ahead of time was cumbersome. I had to Google how to do it since it wasn‚Äôt apparent.  Also, after I finally was able to get that done, there was nowhere that I could find to confirm that it went through. I went to your help section and emailed you regarding this and ask for a response to confirm. First of all in your drop-down menus which I had to pick a selection from each, there was one section that did not cover what I was writing you about. Number two I never have gotten a response from that email. I would suggest that you have a chat section so questions can be answered right away. My driver was great, but your app leaves a lot to be desired. I would like to see an apparent place that you can easily schedule ahead of time. When I googled, it told me to look for a little clock. There was no little clock on my app. I had to Google even further to eventually find out how to navigate to selecting a future time. I am hoping that you deal with these issues to make it easier to schedule with you. Uber has it all over you as far as ease-of-use on the app. I don‚Äôt want to be insulting, but I would like to use Lyft more. Please improve your app.	positive
2803	529379082	travel	2	Please no one should fall for this scam this is not a deal lyft advertises that the lyft pass offer deals and 15% on unlimited rides. My fare price for 20mi is at max 28 dollars with heavy traffic and bad weather conditions. Now since I signed up for the lyft pass I received a 15% discount on only two of my rides. After those two trips the base price of my regular ride I use to commute to and from work only spiked up to 34 to 44 Dollars. I called and explained to lyft on how can my base price rise so high if all of my ride history for months never were that price ,now that I‚Äôm a lyft pink pass member. There explanation was that at that time the rate for drivers and rides were higher so I gave it a chance to see if they‚Äôre telling the truth or robbing customers money. I come to find out lyft did lie to me I‚Äôve been checking every hr for two days now and my base price still is over 34$ there‚Äôs absolutely no way that the demands are high that it‚Äôs being calculated correctly. I canceled my ride pass and my base price is now back at 28$ at max fare. This is a complete scam and false advertisement. If you sign up for the lyft pass you will not be saving money that‚Äôs for sure all they‚Äôre going to do is raise the base price you were paying so you‚Äôll still be paying the same price as before except your giving them a extra twenty dollars a month to do it. I hope that a law firm adds how much money is being stolen from customers and sues lyft for what they‚Äôre doing.	negative
2804	529379082	travel	5	"I take a Lyft almost every day and all over the country.  Lyft is far and away a more responsible choice than Uber.  They treat the drivers better, take their safety concerns seriously, and reward them for providing a good customer experience.  Women drivers I‚Äôve talked to overwhelmingly prefer it.

That said, the algorithms used to find ‚Äònearby‚Äô drivers are abysmal.  I live in Montlake, a dense part of Seattle‚Äôs core.  We have some of the worst traffic in the state, and bridges limit route options.  Lyft prediction for how long it will take for a driver to arrive are off by 5-10X.  The algorithm picks cars I can see are never going to be able to get to me on the map, and often waits 10 or more minutes before ‚Äòswitching‚Äô to a driver that is closer, and still 10 mins away.  That‚Äôs right, it is common to wait 20 minutes for a pickup when I can see 5+ drivers within 2 miles of my location on the map, because Lyft picked the wrong one to start.  In my neighborhood picking a driver 2 mi away one direction is a 5 minute wait, while the same distance a different direction can be 45 mins.  Please, please, please incorporate real time traffic data into your algorithm.  At this point that is decade old technology included in almost every directions app."	positive
2805	529379082	travel	5	I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs been going on with this app, but it has been absolutely frustrating and getting worse. Today I requested a pickup, and automatically it asks if I want to be picked up at work (I‚Äôm assuming because I request there a lot), but today I was a few blocks away so I had to adjust where I wanted to be picked up. I set my current location as pickup and confirmed it. I got a notification when the driver was a minute away, I check the app, and he‚Äôs at my work. The place I made sure it wasn‚Äôt set to pick me up. So I cancelled the ride, asked for the $5 cancellation fee to be reversed, and tried again. I TRIPLE checked that my location was set probably and yet, the driver was set to pick me up at work, the wrong location. This time however, I clicked ‚Äúedit pickup‚Äù and dragged the curser directly over my location, DIRECTLY, over it, clicked confirm and suddenly the cursor automatically moves a block away from where I placed it and then won‚Äôt let me change again. So I had to call my driver and give him my own directions to find me. My 10 minute trip quickly turned into much longer. I never had these experiences with Lyft before but recently they‚Äôve been happening so often it might just be worth it to take the bus.	negative
2806	529379082	travel	1	I have used Lyft for years and in different countries and I honestly say that had the web got bigger the quality got so much worse . It‚Äôs like anyone can be a driver but no upkeep or checks are done . They can come smelling of weed or just dirty , speak to you however they want , be incredibly rude , txt driving . And the customer has no way of reporting it coz there like 3 auto responses available to contact you. Drivers cancel out rides on purpose or like one I m on right now didn‚Äôt stop at my location and will activate ‚Äú your ride is here timer ‚Äú before even stopping the car. I literally was sitting in my drive way and saw him pass by. When I called him , he didn‚Äôt want to drive back even tho he‚Äôs the one that didn‚Äôt stop at the right place . Last week your driver was so rude I refused to get in the car . He held my ride for 47 mins . I was trapped . Coz he didn‚Äôt want to cancel and I didn‚Äôt think it was right for me to do so. I have lost count of how many time the driver didn‚Äôt speak English to the point of not understanding left and right . Bottom line is you take our money and leave us with the rudest,  unprofessional drivers and give us close to no option to communicate with you. And if god forbid we want to cancel coz of one of these situations , we are charged. You figured out the algorithm into my bank account , but clearly have very long way to go with basic manners and customer service from both your drivers and your general services.	negative
2807	529379082	travel	1	I normally use Uber. I trust Uber more than Lyft. One of my sister is using Lyft since 1 year and she‚Äôs fine. Yesterday I had a dentist and took off wisdom teeth after a while I downloaded the Lyft app and I made account then I booked a ride for $7.58 from dentist to my work it was a very important to get to my work before afternoon. I had to submit some important information to HR. I booked the ride and they gave me an stupid driver who was totally over than retirement age even though he‚Äôs supposed to drive deaf man.  After standing for 15-20 minutes the app shows he‚Äôs arrived and they were asking to look for gray ford 2011 David name old man. Tell me one thing how could I get to him when there was a parking lot and there was already all parked cars no one came there with Lyft tag on their front. I called the driver 4-6 times 3 times he picked up and just said HELLO and he hanged up. He did the same for 3 times after that he dropped my calls n didn‚Äôt replied my msg I send him that I‚Äôm in front of densit hospital where are you. Then he just maked 5 minutes and he left me there without replying without responding to my calls. In few seconds I booked another ride they charged me the fee without ride without getting me to my destination. It was a 100 times hate and regret for me why even I made the Lyft I hate it . Now I‚Äôm sending this review and their system isn‚Äôt allowing me they‚Äôre asking for nickname I tried 7 nickname they‚Äôre rejecting.. why? Bcz they‚Äôre scammers	negative
2808	529379082	travel	4	Absolutely love using this app . The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the different types of drivers . Granted majority of the time I get great drivers . I‚Äôve been using this app on and off for 3 years now . In the 3 years I‚Äôve used this app I‚Äôve come across 4-5 horrible drivers . I feel as though hygiene should b a MuST ! I got a driver today who was of the Indian culture and did not have any type of fragrance or deodorant on . I understand for some types of religion it‚Äôs a no no . But if your job requires you to interact with the public in a commercial capacity you should at the very least wear deodorant or powder . Something to mask the HORRIBLE smell !!! Other than that it‚Äôs a solid 4 star for me . They usually pick you up right at the location you put in. I would suggest the engineers or whoever to fix the location services . I have used just my location at times instead of typing in the adress to where I am located and 6 times so far I‚Äôve been picked up in the wrong location . Aka up the block or up the block and across the street . Across the highway . So that part is bad . Other then those 2 issues and the fact that the drivers are people and have ‚Äú mood swings‚Äù I have no complaints . It‚Äôs a relatively good app all around.	negative
2809	529379082	travel	5	Been using Lyft for a while when it became my company‚Äôs preferred ride share provider.  The service itself has been great. My gripe is the receipts you get. The email receipts you send after a ride are totally useless for expense reporting. The format you use doesn‚Äôt allow the payment info to print on the page.  I even tried landscape mode and it still doesn‚Äôt work.  You have a zillion business users.  We need to attach receipts to expense reports electronically.  PDF versions that are concise and under one page are what we need.  As it is now, I‚Äôm forced to snap a photo/JPG on my phone and then convert it to PDF and then email it to myself. That‚Äôs nuts!  The email you send takes 3 pages to print, and even then, the format doesn‚Äôt have the expense info on it because of the crazy formatting you use.  I tried going to my account on your website and there is no ride history data to allow you to get a receipt there.  You guys really put no thought into making this easy for business users.  If I have to keep doing this I will probably just go back to Uber simply to get receipts easier. I‚Äôd gladly talk to anyone there about this.  Thanks.	positive
2810	529379082	travel	4	Several times lately I‚Äôve found that if I didn‚Äôt specify where I was by entering an address the Lyft driver could not find me. I asked a Lyft driver, who had grown up in Seattle what the problem was. He suggested I always enter an exact address, even if I had to look it up in advance. I did that this morning and tonight and had a better experience. If we add inexperienced drivers in a location to the problem of the satellite location you can be texting with a driver who is on the other side of the block and doesn‚Äôt understand you are waiting at the front door of the hall ‚ÄúTown Hall‚Äù Seattle, Wa. Not only that but this morning I entered an address where I was at a diner and the program auto changed it to Coleman Dock 2-3 blocks away. What gives?  I am writing on my husbands phone. I‚Äôm Dusty Collings. We are traveling together and we take turns calling Lyft. I think, & hope you can make some refinements to the experience. I don‚Äôt like having to pay for a driver who is in the wrong location and doesn‚Äôt want to drive around the block to pick me up. It wasn‚Äôt my fault and I had to pay the fee for standing him up. Not really fair. I have a walking disability and I try limit the number of steps I take. Thanks.	negative

The latest update has done wonders for the graphic identity of the brand and it looks especially good on my iPhone X, they‚Äôve done a good job of integrating the notch into the design that makes the whole app feel purposeful and user friendly. One thing they changed, however, and have made much worse in my opinion. They changed the order sequence from ~dropoff lovation>pickup location>size select and confirmation~ to ~dropoff location>size select>pickup location and confirmation~ this has made the buying order process much more confusing even for an experienced Lyft rider. The final order screen should always have the approximate dropoff time and the expected cost on it, in my opinion. With the latest update the final order screen simply asks you where you‚Äôd like to be picked up and honestly this makes no sense to me. The last purple button before you‚Äôre charged doesn‚Äôt even say ‚Äúorder Lyft‚Äù it just says ‚Äúconfirm pickup‚Äù which has led me to accidentally order a Lyft when all I wanted to do was check approximate times and charges for a Lyft I would be taking later in the day. I think if this aspect were changed it would round out the app perfectly and make it deserving of 5 stars.	positive
2812	529379082	travel	1	Lyft no showed me twice in the same day. Each time I was outside waiting watching the app and how close the drivers were to me. Twice they came within 6 blocks from me and then the app stopped the drivers eta and routed me brand new drivers. Both times they started my arrival times all over while I was waiting outside( somewhat cold out). I‚Äôve used the Lyft app for about a year. In that year I‚Äôve missed my driver outside maybe 2-3 times. All times I was charged a $5.00 cancellation fee which seemed fair being I wasn‚Äôt outside when they arrived( they left). Now why on earth can the Lyft drivers then no show me and they don‚Äôt hold there drivers to the same standards they hold there customers to. My time is just as valuable as theirs. But apparently Lyft didn‚Äôt think so. I wasn‚Äôt given the 2 no show cancellation credits when they did it to me. Seems unreasonable that they can charge the customer a $5 dollar cancellation fee but we can‚Äôt get that same credit when they no show us. I‚Äôll never use Lyft again. They wouldn‚Äôt even make it right either, instead they acknowledged the wrong and basically kept asking me the same thing over and over and over. Basically wanting me to just go away. I could care less about the money but it‚Äôs the principle. I‚Äôm a business owner and I can‚Äôt get away with screwing my customers over the way these guys do. Oh well I guess. I just downloaded the Uber app. Bye Lyft!	positive
2813	529379082	travel	1	I‚Äôd like to go and say that I was a huge fan of this app. So much so I barely walked anywhere or took the bus seeing how I‚Äôm 18 and a car is in my agenda at the moment. I lyft‚Äôd almost everyday to work for the inexpensive price of 11$ to get to and from work. Until one day I ordered a lyft 20 minutes ahead of my expected appearance at work seeing how the ride was about 6 minutes and this was a very very rare occasion because I would order 10 minutes ahead. So I get a driver and he approaches my home. For some reason my driver switches to someone further than the previous. This all happens in a 5 minute span so I don‚Äôt worry. I look at my phone and the driver is not moving at all. This happens for 10 minutes. My driver. Not moving an inch. So I decide to cancel the ride and just walk seeing how I‚Äôm already running a little behind and a lyft at this point would be wasting money. I soon see that cancelling costs 5$ which is around the price of my normal ride. So I expected a refund and to be short a dollar in this inconvenience. Nope 12 wasted on a lyft I didn‚Äôt even take. The app has the gull to have one of the refund options say ‚Äúdriver isn‚Äôt moving‚Äù while simultaneously saying they have driver their way to me so pay 5$. Morale I‚Äôd say is to not rely on lyft for work. Bite the bullet and take reliable routes for work, school, etc. leave the lyft rides for something more lenient.	negative
2814	529379082	travel	1	I have never experienced anything like this.I was almost about to be late to my job and I can‚Äôt be late so, I decided to call a lyft, everything went well I see my driver coming close so I wait outside, but he just kept going straight instead of turning, so I seen that he kept going straight and I called him, and he declined it. I thought he probably got turned around and had the wrong address so I called again, declined again, then I said to myself okay if he doesn‚Äôt turn around right here somethings up, he kept going, so I couldn‚Äôt cancel or else I would be charged and they didn‚Äôt reroute me until he was 8 minutes away from me, they rerouted me and the next driver was 20 minutes away finishing up a current ride, something has to be done because there wasn‚Äôt anywhere that I could go to on the lyft app to report that my driver wasn‚Äôt going the right way so I could get a new driver, which made me extremely late, I have the drivers number but not his profile picture :( The service is bad I try to report something but there isn‚Äôt a place for the report that I‚Äôm trying to do, my bank statement came in and it showed this I know charges with the same number as the lyfts item number thing and it won‚Äôt let me delete my card and then you have to email which take forever to respond, you don‚Äôt even get to talk to an actual personü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èNEVER USING LYFT AGAIN	negative
2815	529379082	travel	1	This company has no respect for the drivers they will steal from you every chance they get via cancellation fees and app payment issues etc. when you call to rectify the situation they disrespect and talk down to you in hopes that you will lose your temper so they can disconnect the call. If you don‚Äôt lose your cool they leave you on hold for as long as it takes for you to hang up so you don‚Äôt receive a survey not that responding to the survey makes any difference...in my case I stayed on hold for 4 hours!!. Lyft is by far the most ghetto trashy ride share company out there. I can‚Äôt believe they want to go public with the type of unsolved issues they have with their operation. They expect drivers to give 5 star service to passengers which I do while providing less than 1 star service to drivers in return. They don‚Äôt even have a working telephone number, they make it extremely difficult to speak with anyone unless you write an email which they selectively respond to if you are lucky. They know most drivers that work for them don‚Äôt have many other options so they exploit that to the fullest. I done nearly 4000 rides in only a year of working for them all while maintaining a 5 star rating but this means nothing to them you don‚Äôt even get a bonus, thank you, or even a thumbs up emoji. What a sad company.	negative
2816	529379082	travel	5	I‚Äôm a Lyft and Uber Driver for one year now. At the normal rate, Lyft pays Drivers a hair more than Uber. There is hardly any Primetime and when there is, it‚Äôs at a very low percentage except when there is extremely inclement weather. As a full time driver driving for both Companies, the only way to make a profit is through Primetime and Surge, period. A good example of how cheap the driver pay is from Lyft is earlier this week they had an available scheduled ride to take someone from Englewood Cliffs, NJ to Philly, PA for a payment between $101 and $111-that is offensive and highway robbery. That‚Äôs clearly a loss to any driver. By the time you factor in tolls, gas, wear and tear on your car and time spent not being able to pick up in PA until you hit NJ, it‚Äôs def not worth it. Their customer service is the worst, period. They outsource to the Philippines and they are ALL trained to be very polite but that‚Äôs it-no knowledge to assist you. Their scheduled rides are not guaranteed so although you are the ‚Äúdesignated‚Äù driver, you are NOT guaranteed to get the passenger-outrageous! I hardly turn on my Lyft App and instead drive for Uber more which I might add isn‚Äôt much better.	positive
2817	529379082	travel	1	Honestly every rider has their own experiences so this is mine. I live in a brand new neighborhood that hasn‚Äôt quite made it on the gps yet so I understand it can get a little complicated. I make sure to leave a note or call the driver to let them know it‚Äôs the next neighborhood over and I even order my Lyft almost two hours before work just in case something happens you know? Well something happened. The driver Jogander read my pick up note and still didn‚Äôt follow it (annoying but understandable no harm done) so I call him and I‚Äôm literally on the phone for about five minutes explaining to him what to do (leave that neighborhood, take a right and just drive down till you see my neighborhood name. Simple right?) So he tells me he‚Äôs on his way and I‚Äôm waiting on this man not knowing nor getting a notification that he CANCELED and I was still charged a cancellation fee. So not only have I wasted time waiting for a ride that wasn‚Äôt even coming I‚Äôm also running late to work. I contact customer care and they refund me the fee but when I asked if they at least contact the driver or something for lying they hit me with the whole ‚Äúwell we refunded you isn‚Äôt that enough‚Äù bull crap. Honestly Lyft is still a type of job so employees need to be held accountable I‚Äôm going straight back to urber. It may cost me a few dollars more but they haven‚Äôt pulled this bs with me (yet).	positive
2818	529379082	travel	5	"I have used Lyft & Uber and I can easily say I will never use Uber again not because the drivers are terrible but because the UBER platform is horrible. In fact I deleted that app because of poor customer service. 

Now to Lyft. The drivers are incredibly polite & happy. They seem to enjoy working for the company but one thing I wish the company would do is have some sort of incentives for their drivers rather than just take their percentage and forget about the drivers. After all it‚Äôs the drivers using their vehicles, fuel, insurance & phones. The least Lyft can do is match the tips the drivers get or give 50% bonus on top of tips. Doing this will just motivate the drivers to maybe add bottled water, keep their cars more clean or even get more frequent washes. Lyft, invest into your assets from one business owner to another. If not you will just be another Uber when Tesla comes out with their ride share company. Constantly strive to be better or you will fall behind in the game because right now all you are is a online platform taking a percentage from drivers who knocked out local cab drivers."	positive
2819	529379082	travel	2	Have clear instructions and work flow for customers trying to schedule future rides. Honestly, it used to much easier to request a lyft for a future date. With the current home screen and user face, it‚Äôs hard to see the ‚Äúschedule‚Äù touch point and doesn‚Äôt flow well at all. When I‚Äôm scheduling a future ride, I want to make that clear first thing, up front, immediately...not be lead on a scheme to accidentally request a ride for ‚Äúright now‚Äù and have to pay cancellation charges. It makes lyft appear a bit shady. Uber has that title. Please revert to customer friendly, simple app services and not try to trick anyone into anything...I use lyft bc I trust it more than Uber. That trust has severely wavered with this recent update. Also a huge downfall: not having an immediately accessible service team. I needed help bc my app updated in the middle of scheduling my ride to the airport 24hrs in advance and, again, I could‚Äôt figure out how to request future ride in new update. It was imperative and down to the wire for me to request lyft and the time kept creeping forward (it wasn‚Äôt allowing me to request my trip any sooner than exactly 24hrs in advance somehow). I tried to talk to someone at lyft to no avail. I am a loyal customer and hope this message is heard! Otherwise back to old school taxis and I am your target market millenial!	positive
2820	529379082	travel	1	I had to fly into Minneapolis for military training. There are three of us from my unit back home and since we flew and don‚Äôt have cars, we decided to ride together for dinner. Our hotel is on base and right next to the airport. Our lyft driver picked us up from the gate in which we walked to on a sidewalk the whole time wearing shoes we unpacked from our bags. The drive was fine, so I was courteous and gave a tip. About an hour later, I get an email that I was being charged a damage fee of $25. They claimed they had proof of damage as shown by pictures of mud in the floorboard of the vehicle. The pictures did show such, but what the pictures didn‚Äôt show was a time and date the pictures were taken. In the email it said the pictures were time and date stamped, but when I asked for them to send those to me, all I got was that the evidence was there. Also, the so-called evidence in the picture showed the mud being dry, which is hard to believe it could be from us if the pictures were taken immediately after we got out as stated. I asked to speak to a supervisor and wasn‚Äôt granted that request either. This company is garbage and I will be taking my business elsewhere. It‚Äôs such a shame to be taken advantage of simply because we are from out of town and people think the military just has money to waste! Don‚Äôt let this company rip you off people!	negative
2821	529379082	travel	5	I just had my 3rd incident were a driver left me at my first stop because I was taking too long which I don‚Äôt mind but I asked him and he said it was fine and if a driver can‚Äôt wait any longer I‚Äôd at least like a heads up that their leaving. Now each time this has happened lyft was swift in refunding my money and generally send me an email of apology. I know not everyone‚Äôs perfect but they guys at lyft are always on point with any problems or concerns. I‚Äôve had an incident where a driver tried to kiss me and was refunded the full amount along with an email. I‚Äôve never had the app crash but I have heard there are problems from time to time. Guys I don‚Äôt care about that kind of problems because you‚Äôll have that with any app or technology from time to time and as far as I‚Äôve heard they fix it in a timely matter. So I can‚Äôt find one bad thing to say about lyft. Uber doesn‚Äôt take my debit card so they lost out on my business to lyft and I‚Äôm so glad I ended up here instead. There are promos that help from time to time and it‚Äôs very easy to contact lyft if I ever need to. Thanks guys for being on point with your customers.	positive
2822	529379082	travel	4	I had breakfast and set up my first ride with Lyft. The system told me who my driver would be and that he was 10 minutes away. I was watching his progress and it kept telling me he was finishing up with a previous ride. I saw that he turned south onto Hefner Parkway and heading south. The arrival time kept getting longer. 13, 15, 17 minutes then I noticed he had gotten onto I-44 and was heading east. I texted the driver and let him know that I had a 9:30 Dr appt and as it was after 9:00 were we going to make it. He told me that the ride he had gave him the wrong address. He kept getting farther and farther away. Needless to say I was growing very unhappy with Lyft and had never encountered any problems with Uber. I canceled the ride and placed another order. It was 9:10. The lady that picked my up helped to ease my frustrations and made the ride to the Dr very enjoyable. I do not understand why the first driver couldn‚Äôt have texted me and let me know there was problem so I could ask for another driver. It all ended all right and I wasn‚Äôt late to the appt, 9:28. If he had only texted me, it would have saved a lot of frustration. I have used Lyft 3-4 more times today and everything went like clockwork.	positive
2823	529379082	travel	1	I have been using Lyft for a long time, it‚Äôs my preferred ride share service. Never had any issues, until one day I left my phone in one of the rides I took. After about 2 minutes, I realized what had happened, and there is a way to contact the driver for lost items, so I tried that route. The driver did not answer, and I know that his phone was on the dashboard for GPS use because I was in the front seat. So obviously he saw I was calling. After countless calls, voicemails, texts, and messages sent to Lyft corporate through the website help center I received no response. I was finally able to reach the driver after a full day, and it was extremely sketchy. He answered the phone and did not say anything for about 20 seconds. He said that he did not see it and he would check again and be in touch. Never heard from him after that. After hours of trying to reach the help center by phone, I was told the Lost and Found team does not have a phone line they can be reached at, and to fill out the form on the help center website. I had already done that numerous times, so by now I‚Äôve lost all hope. Lyft customer service is an absolute nightmare, and I would highly encourage anyone to use Uber as I know they are making strides to improve their customer service, which is more than I can say for Lyft itself. Avoid at all costs.	positive
2824	529379082	travel	1	I waited over 30 minutes for the driver to ‚Äúcomplete a trip‚Äù on the way to pick me up...at this point, the car started very slowly heading in my direction, and the arrival time kept going up the closer the driver got to where they were supposed to turn to pick me up, but then they passed my location and continued on, appearing to have no intention whatsoever of picking me up. I decided since I‚Äôd now been waiting 45 minutes and could have had a taxi pick me up faster, that I would go ahead and cancel and find a ride through someone other than Lyft. This would have been my 3rd time using Lyft and the other two times were slightly sketchy, in terms of creepy drivers. But since I had a 10% discount for having a 5 Star rating, I wanted to use Lyft anyway. I can tolerate weirdness to an extent...but not showing up when they agreed to pick me up is a deal breaker. So now my discount has expired and evidently they did me a big favor by not charging a cancellation fee??? If anything, I think the driver should have to pay me if they accepted my ride and completely blew me off. Sorry but if I‚Äôm told my ride will be there in 10 minutes and 45 minutes later, the driver is passing my pickup point without slowing down or any indication they‚Äôre coming back, etc...yeah I will cancel and use Uber or a taxi. And I expect to never be charged for canceling for such a reason.	negative
2825	529379082	travel	5	Above all other ride services, I have to recommend Lyft! Prices are more reasonable, response is immediate and without a doubt, ALWAYS, within a reasonable time frame for pick up.  I have rarely had a snore personality driving me from point A to point B.  These people are kind, out going and all around cool.  This is a service industry job.  Please remember that. Whatever your reason for requiring a transport, remember that they are providing a needed service and while tipping isn‚Äôt required, I stress that you deliver it.  They have NO set income and provide you with a convenience you can‚Äôt find through public transportation. Take care of those who take care of you.  The universe reciprocates kindness in the least expected moments.  Also, Uber is a money hungry monster.  Lyft is a competitive career with so many people employing themselves through it. Remember remember remember! These people deserve a couple extra dollars for their hospitality. Be kind to others. Be true to others.  Be grateful for your advances.  And always share your love!  Hope this was helpful and encouraging! If not, here‚Äôs a get out of jail free card.  USE LYFT!	positive
2826	529379082	travel	2	I have had many instances lately (most recently last night) that drivers hit the button that indicates they are at my identified pick up spot and in reality they are not AND I am being charged wait time.  This has become increasingly frustrating and in some instances when the driver wasn‚Äôt at the pick up and I called to question instead of trying to find me they just cancel my ride.   This puts me at the end of the que and I have to wait AGAIN for a ride.  The most recent ride that did this to me was last night when I scheduled a pickup and the driver (I only have his phone number because Lyft doesn‚Äôt leave me the information of drivers that cancel) couldn‚Äôt find my pickup location even though it was clear on the map where I was.  He wasn't at the pick up location but hit the button indicating he was so I called and he kept telling me he couldn‚Äôt get to the pick up spot when in fact there many cars driving past me.  I patiently waited and after I called him 2 times he canceled my ride.  I had to get another Lyft and wait another 18 minutes- after I had already waited for 15 minutes.   This is becoming common and will make me think twice before requesting a Lyft in the future- drivers can‚Äôt seem to read maps and understand directions.	negative
2827	529379082	travel	4	The title pretty much explains it all. I‚Äôve been using Lyft since their cars were driving around San Diego with big pink furry mustaches on the grilles. Tourists always asking what‚Äôs with those cars? And I would be happy to explain and show them what Lyft was all about. People always comparing Uber and Lyft and always having SOOOO many horror stories about Uber and I would ask, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you use Lyft?‚Äù And the answer is always the same, to save a few bucks. Well I promise, especially in San Diego, Lyft is ALWAYS worth the extra dollar or two. Only reasons I didn‚Äôt rate five stars is because it seems Lyft isn‚Äôt being as picky about their drivers. I used to count on Lyft for always having native San Diegan‚Äôs for drivers, not so much anymore. I liked it a lot more when my drivers new the area and paid attention to the road, not their navigation app. Also, it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense that the price to get from Point Loma to Downtown has quadrupled in the last few years. I‚Äôm not exaggerating, I‚Äôve checked my statements. After asking multiple drivers about this I feel it‚Äôs safe to say they have not gotten any raises. Reason for this?	positive
2828	529379082	travel	1	I hope the programmers find themselves in my situation one day. I‚Äôm currently standing out in the cold rain, I‚Äôm soaking wet and I‚Äôve been working a long long day, and I now have to wait 15 minutes for my driver, and he just called and told me he‚Äôs going to stop for gas, so it will probably be more like 20 minutes until he even arrives. FURTHERMORE I can‚Äôt cancel the ride or I‚Äôll be charged $10 and he can‚Äôt cancel the ride at all from his end. Whoever came up with this system is in contention to be one of the most exceedingly moronic idiots on the history of the planet. AND now another Lyft driver has literally pulled up to the curb I‚Äôm standing at, but I can‚Äôt ride with him because the app is SO unbelievably inflexible. So I‚Äôm here with a seemingly infinite amount of time to write a scathing review or your STUPID, useless app. It‚Äôs stupid and useless and also you should pay your drivers better. Do you have brains in your heads Lyft programmers? Do you hate your employees and customers? I‚Äôll be deleting this app as soon as I finish this one last ride (if it ever happens) and I strongly urge you, dear reader, to do the same. Switch to Uber, or get a cab, or heck, you‚Äôre probably even better off walking if you have 20 minutes like I do. Thanks for reading folks and if you happen to be a Lyft programmer or exec, then please take my suggestion into consideration.	negative
2829	529379082	travel	1	App told me driver would be there in 2 minutes. Didn‚Äôt show up for at least 10. The ride cost $30 for a 7 mile ride. My destination was pretty much a straight line east. My estimated time of arrival at my destination was about 25 minutes according to the app. Driver tells me he has to pick someone up. Fine. Next thing I know, we‚Äôre headed north. Way way up north. Before long we are on a highway. Now we‚Äôve traveled the same distance that should have gotten me home by now. I end up taking the grand tour of the Bronx which is no where near where I live. I live in Queens. The driver is then directed to take a major toll bridge to get into Queens. Finally 70 minutes after I ordered the Lyft I finally get dropped off at home. Oh and we never did pick up anyone. What a waste of time and money. Do I blame the driver? Absolutely not. It was the Lyft GPS that directed him to take the longest, most round-about route possible. When I reach out to customer service what do they do? Give me a $5 credit that expires within a week or so and scold me for picking a pooled ride. In a very condescending tone this service rep reminded me that the best way to avoid my experience was to order the deluxe ride next time. I‚Äôve been using Lyft for over a year and always use it over Uber. That has now changed. I have deleted Lyft and will be giving Uber my business instead.	positive
2830	529379082	travel	1	"Driver didn‚Äôt finish the ride for me and forced me out of his car in heavy rain about 10 minutes away from my house. There was a very strong odor in the back seat where I was sitting. I nicely informed the driver that there is bad smell coming from the back seat just so he can take care for next passengers. He replied very rudely that I smell! I thought I didn‚Äôt hear him right so I said what do you mean? I didn‚Äôt say you smell, I just gave you a friendly feedback about your car. But he instead repeated what he said rudely and then asked me to shut up and instead lead him to my address! I got really offended by his action and didn‚Äôt feel safe at his car due to his aggression to the extent that I was about to call 911. I told him that my address is in your map and just follow the direction. He then asked me if I live in that area which I declined to answer. He then forced me out of his car in the heavy rain and incorrectly claimed that he has finished the ride. I was left stranded in the streets with luggage after having a very long flight. 

I am surprised Lyft allows such unsafe drivers to drive for it. I will probably stop using Lyft after this experience. 

They also don‚Äôt have direct customer service that could address emergencies like this and also very slow to get back to you! Yeah right! Mr Robot was available to be fair."	negative
2831	529379082	travel	1	Drivers can literally sit in there spot for what seems like hours when your waiting for a ride or even head the entire different direction! All the while Lyft still tells you the driver is 3 minutes away. After a 30 plus minute wait and multiple driver refreshes just let us request a new driver when they are obviously busy. It‚Äôs bogus when you have to take a $5 charge for someone who‚Äôs going to take 10 minutes to even leave the spot they are in. You‚Äôre nail biting every time you order one of these hoping you actually have a driver. My father had a situation where he scheduled a driver then come the next morning when the drivers supposed to arrive the app is looking for drivers and switching finally after about 15 minutes of a driver not moving. He missed his flight that day but I believe after contacting Lyft got credit towards his account. Cool they will do that but a $30 ride isn‚Äôt the price of a plane ticket. People aren‚Äôt dumb, we know when the driver Lyft selects isn‚Äôt coming within minutes. Just let us cancel  without a charge if the driver isn‚Äôt coming in the timeframe you tell us. That‚Äôs it. Lyfts great otherwise but this issue is just boiling over from how many times I deal with it. Please please please find a fix to this Lyft!!!	positive
2832	529379082	travel	5	I dont know whats going on with lyft but the map that they use for gps is not up to date or maybe its their software. I live in a city  where there is 2 of the same streets in 2 different parts of town. so i get that part of the confusion but on my lyft app its says i am going to my correct location but on the drivers end it says im going across town. Thank God i have enough sense to  double check and guide the driver to my correct location. And get this this is not the first time this has happened  and yes i filed a complaint because the first incident was not pleasant. After not using the app for a while i decided i dont feel like taking the T home let me use lyft. They still did not solve this problem. And I know everyone in this area who uses them have this problem. I rather pay the extra money with Uber atleast they get the address correct ( which at one point they had the same problem but they corrected it). 2 stars from me and i will be deactivating lyft. so warning to everyone if you know where you going and you notice your not going in the right direction speak up.	negative
2833	529379082	travel	4	"I‚Äôve been using this app for a while and have had issues a handful of the time. The first time I experienced an issue was when I requested a Lyft and the driver didn‚Äôt bother to come to my location. He kept driving passed where I was and cancelled my trip afterwards. My ride was then picked up by two different drivers and the same thing happened. I‚Äôm guessing that was a glitch in the software that day. Today I ordered a Lyft shared saver. Context: I‚Äôm at the hospital and needed to get picked up. I walked all the way to the pickup location only to see the driver went to a location of his choosing and didn‚Äôt notify me. When I called him, he gave me attitude and told me to come to where he was. Mind you, that location was at the other corner of the hospital property. As I was 10ft from him, he cancelled my ride and drove off. I made sure to take a screenshot of where he was vs where the app told me to stand and his info. It‚Äôs too bad that we cannot rate drivers unless the ride is complete. I‚Äôd give this ride driver a 1 star if I could. 

A request to Lyft: please allow for reviews for drivers that pick up a ride regardless of if they‚Äôre fulfilled rides or not."	positive
2834	529379082	travel	1	For reference, this is a critique of the app itself, the drivers I have had were pleasant, efficient, and took the safety of everyone in high regard. As far as the app goes, in order to match one with a  driver faster, it often matches riders with drivers more than 10 minutes away, and may or may not match them with a different rider who‚Äôs closer, while this is something designed by all ride sharing apps, with Lyft the issue is unpredictability, resulting in riders waiting longer or shorter than expected, and are at a higher risk of losing rides. Furthermore, less than their competition, Lyft does not update for traffic issue as well, trips that were expected to be 15 minutes can take 40 minutes due to traffic. The final point of interest is in regards to location pin, whatever services Lyft uses to show where a rider is located often are farther off, and doesn‚Äôt take into account road structure: these last few trips, drivers have shown me that they were directed to the back of my apartment building, near the woods located nearby. With all these on s day to day consistent usage over these past few months as I‚Äôve used the app, I have decided to discontinue my usage of Lyft. I appreciate the courtesy of your drivers, and wish you success with your goal of providing service of your customers-Tom.	positive
2835	529379082	travel	5	I have had great experiences with Lyft which is why I still use the service. HOWEVER, this past weekend (Sept 1st-2nd), picking up from Newark Penn station changed that. None of the drivers shoulders up within the time the app stated. There were too many horrible drivers: poor attitudes, disrespectful, and not willing to follow the traffic light or the gps. Two drivers began cursing to show their anger‚Äîone because a light wouldn‚Äôt change fast enough, and he made a left turn on the red light with me and another passenger in the car (Viktor‚ÄîLEKL70)! The other driver was cursing because she went to the wrong side to pick me up, disregarding where gps told her I was (Ufaefeea‚ÄîK22KBY). She also was terribly rude, wouldn‚Äôt make an effort to come to me so I offered to walk to her and by the time I got to her, she hung up the phone and canceled the ride. Between 2:36PM and 2:55PM, I had 5 different driver changes/updates. Finally, Helen (U82-GZG) showed up and was a delight. Lyft, this is unacceptable. While there are taxis available and they are not better with price, [some of], their attitudes are and they are right there waiting.	negative
2836	529379082	travel	1	I have used LYFT off & on over a year now, originally they were my go to opposed to Uber because when I did have any issues w. a ride or driver I was always helped within a few hours (if that long). Lyft no longer has that human to human contact and sadly now I have received MULTIPLE (at least 8+) drivers who have PURPOSELY found ways to attempt to get paid through cancellation fees through this app. This was my last straw, I normally do not write reviews however I just witnessed my driver mark himself present in my location 2 mins prior to arriving then called him (because they never call you) and asked if it was an effort to get a cancellation fee for him to say un huh on the phone and cause me to be charged w. that exact fee .. which was more than the cost of the ride. Now I have to wait more than a day to receive that money back or contact my bank because Lyft no longer respects their consumer. SAVE YOUR TIME & YOUR MONEY! ! Find a ride sharing app that still has some sort of human contact or at least responses within an appropriate amount of time if their drivers are abusing their policies. They responded to this review and still haven‚Äôt responded to any of the 3 complaints I‚Äôve had to file w. them in the past 2 weeks. üò≠AGAIN, DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY FOR YOUR RIDE SHARING OR ONLINE RIDE REQUEST!	negative
2837	529379082	travel	4	When in need of a ride, Lyft is normally very reliable and I have gotten wonderful drivers most of the time. However, when leaving home from Decatur, GA., I experienced a driver (Juan) who accepted my ride request and had me waiting approximately 15-20 minutes and then he wound up dropping my request. My request was to the airport, so I cannot express strongly enough how every minute counted. After his terribly inconsiderate cancellation, I was initially assigned to another driver who was 13 minutes away. I cannot tell you how very frustrated I was with Lyft at that moment. Fortunately, Lyft then found me a closer driver (Lashon) who was only 4 minutes away. Lashon was GREAT and got me to the airport in plenty of time to catch my flight but I still can‚Äôt get over Juan accepting my ride request only to have me waiting in vein for 20 minutes wasting my time AND jeopardizing me catching my flight. I would certainly like to see him reprimanded and definitely want him BLOCKED from ever picking up another ride request from me in the future! And this guy supposedly have a 5 star rating? I don‚Äôt think so. Very disappointed with that terrible experience üëéüèΩ	negative
2838	529379082	travel	5	"I have quite literally taken hundreds of Lyfts from Old Temple Terrace to Ybor and never once have I had a driver that hasn't been kind and accommodating. We prefer to get out a little before the main walk through of Ybor so our driver doesn't have to navigate the causeway of drunken idiots rambling along 7th as that is largely a pedestrian walkway. On our way home, our drivers are just basically kind to us even if we aren't 100% sober which we greatly appreciate. We have never felt taken advantage of or used by our drivers with this app and I think it has to do with the company ethics over Uber, which pay their drivers the minimum but can't live without tips, vs. the no pressure extra tipping system of Lyft. However, please tip your drivers if they provide the basic services you require as we all live in the  hellscape of late stage capitalism and must rely on each other to take care of those in the service industry. Thanks for reading if you got past ""late stage capitalism"" and stayed with me. And thank you for tolerating my run-in sentences!"	positive
2839	529379082	travel	2	"This service would be better if: 
1. If drivers didn‚Äôt lock down pickups while currently dropping off another customer, typically adding significantly more more time than a customer would be waiting otherwise. 
2. If drivers would stop using third party apps for directions. Or at least act like their passengers are trying to get to their destination promptly. No one orders a pickup with the intention of a 10 minutes ride taking 25 minutes while the driver takes the scenic route. I shouldn‚Äôt have to express that I‚Äôm in a realistic hurry to a stranger. They should understand that‚Äôs the implication of ordering a pickup, that I want to reach my destination promptly. 
3. If drivers would quit driving ridiculously large circles around a neighborhood, only because they get penalized for taking u-turns. I literally watched a driver pass my location by 30 feet, but instead of turning into one of the many parking lots at my school to turn around, the driver just kept driving, around an entire college campus, to try to pick me up. When I watched this add 7 minutes to the trip I canceled. These inconveniences, at customer expense, defeat the purpose of paying for a service as simple as following a map that‚Äôs so easy to read."	positive

2842	529379082	travel	2	Dear Lyft - I hope this helps to improve your app!  I tried to edit my ride, then cancel. The app had automatically imputed my home (understandably!) instead of my intended pick up point at the car repair spot; when I realized this, I tapped ‚Äòedit‚Äô which only shows a map instead of my pre- designated destinations - the addresses which I don‚Äôt know - hence pre- designated.  Why doesn‚Äôt the app list them with an option of a map? Or easily allow one to choose that list? Could not quickly find this option - not user friendly.  When I tried to cancel, it showed ‚Äòfee waived‚Äô but without saying I had only 2 minutes to cancel - this should be clearly stated with a warning in RED.  Thinking the fee would be waived, and I had time, I tried calling the driver; he was no help since he only goes by the inputed map and didn‚Äôt know the street where i wanted to meet for the pick up.  So I canceled - but then the app showed he was coming anyway, which was confusing since later on I discovered I was charged the cancel fee - plus, it asked to rate the ride - the driver was faultless here and got 5 Stars.  I was upset and frustrated, late for my appointment.  I hope this is useful- will update rating when improvements are made.	positive
2843	529379082	travel	5	This was my first time riding Lyft, I was very hesitant in trying this type of transportation. I have heard horror stories when it comes to Uber, so I didn‚Äôt know if Lyft would be the same. I found out that my reservations were wrong. I had a driver that came to me with a friendly smile and was able to take care of my luggage and help me out. He also had a clean and refreshing spelling car. We had a professional yet friendly conversation that entertains a quick ride to where I needed to go. He drove safe and I feel comfortable riding in the vehicle. Also, I made reservations for a ride but it was unsuccessful, I was not worried because of the fact that Lyft communicates through text message. So, I was informed throughout the whole process. I then ended up making another ride and immediately within three minutes was able to get transportation to where I needed to go. I will definitely be using Lyft in the future above any other transportation. A great experience for first-time user. I have found my alternate transportation from cab and Acess.	positive
2844	529379082	travel	5	I first used Lyft because I had heard so much about it being that I‚Äôm disabled and can‚Äôt drive it was a way for me to get around places. I used your service in March 2019 and for some reason my phone showed the charge but wouldn‚Äôt accept my payment. And I had someone else do it on their phone and it went through. The driver came and he was very nice he took me too Hobby Airport. When I got to St. Louis, Mo. I tried to use Lyft again, and it saying that I still owe for the ride I paid for. And I had to catch a taxi home because it was late and no one could come and get me. Me and my son have sent email after email to no avail. I have the proof that payment was received by Uber and it came out of my account so why is it still saying I owe is beyond me. I tried to use it Monday now that I‚Äôm back in Texas and they‚Äôre trying to charge me for the ride I want to take and for the ride I initially paid for. I would love it if someone would look into this matter. I have all the proof you need to verify that the transaction went through. PLEASE HELP ME!!!	positive
2845	529379082	travel	1	I am not rating one star just because I, as a driver had a bad experience. It is only to get the app developer‚Äôs attention so that some serious changes could be made in be app meant for passengers. Being a Lyft Driver, I had the inconvenience of an irate customer who did not think twice to check for the license plate of the ride he had requested from the app and somehow had three ride requests cancelled before he got into my vehicle out of his own frustration. The passenger, being a 63 old, huge & hefty man, who had a hard time walking five steps towards his Lyft ride was completely unwilling to get out of my car even after realizing he GOT THE WRONG RIDE the fourth time around. I do realize and am guilty of the fact that I had to drop him home which was only 8 minutes away by being offline and missing the rides which could have paid me a lot more than the wrong one. This is a humble request to the developer to PLEASE add a feature for the passengers which will force them to verify the license plate and the driver in the vehicle before the journey begins as this could end up being a lawsuit by keeping this loophole exposed for passengers. Sooner or later, the passengers will find out about this and someone out there will find a way to use this for their advantage.	negative
2846	529379082	travel	5	I just started using this application this year and converted from Uber. It has been quite a difference and I have been extremely satisfied with this ridesharing service up until last week when the application was updated. The changes to the interface has affected the overall accessibility for the visually impaired. This application was not the most accessible prior to the update, but it was usable. Now, the application has become more stressful to use because certain things are more difficult to bring up such as the option to split a fair and other things. The previous version was at least consistent and I knew where to find things. This update rearranged certain functions of the overall experience has made using this application quite difficult to say the least. Please go back to making things how they were because if it comes down to having to just stop seizing to use this service; I have no issue resorting to this or even dare I say returning back to Uber. Thank you.	negative
2847	529379082	travel	5	Overall I‚Äôve been satisfied with the quality and professionalism of drivers.  Clearly Lyft is working with their team on ensuring drivers are prepared to act as a representative of Lyft rather than someone who simply has some time to pass and takes said person from point A to point B. The added accommodations of bottled water, mints and reading materials all make a difference - I wish all drivers were required to provide this.  Still - some drivers are clearly more interested in providing stellar service and treating this as a job than others.  That being said, I wish there was a way for Lyft to allow for a user to request a particular driver for a month since many users have made a connection with a ptocular driver here and there. If even be willing to pay $1000 a month or more to secure a particular driver that I have made a connection with since I use Lyft 14 plus times a week. It would be a great convenience for those who don‚Äôt want to have a car but have the comfort of a set driver.	positive
2848	529379082	travel	1	UPDATE -a week and a half later- : Customer service is awful. All I get is what is probably a stock answer. They continue to tell me a charge to my MasterCard was not authorized when the bank for my MasterCard told me the day of the incident that the charge WAS authorized. All I would really like is an apology and for someone to look into what must be a system problem. - I added the Lyft app and attempted to use Lyft as it came highly recommended. I requested my first Lyft at LAX after collecting my bags and was told by the app that Lyft was having trouble with my payment method. It said ‚Äútry another card,‚Äù so I had to enter  another card at the airport, and got the same message. I thought if had to do with being 3000 miles from home and maybe they blocked the cards. Called both banks and was told everything was fine with them. One of the bank reps specifically said that the charge came through and the bank AUTHORIZED the charge, and I got the message from Lyft that the card was a problem. My brother got me a car, and the driver was great, but I spent an extra hour at LAX for no good reason because of Lyft. I‚Äôve read online that people have been experiencing this since at least 2013. One person in 2017 said the problem has been an issue for that person for a YEAR.	negative
2849	529379082	travel	1	If I could give 0 stars I would. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Lyft to anyone at all. I‚Äôve been using Lyft for awhile now with out any problem until recently. When the Lyft had arrived as soon as I opened the door the driver asked me for my age. I was thrown off by that question because I‚Äôve never been asked that before. I asked why and he said because I looked underage and he wanted to see my ID. I told him that I wasn‚Äôt giving him my ID because I don‚Äôt have to. He cancelled the ride and ended up calling someone from Lyft to tell them what had. He told the person on the phone that I was underage which is not true. I then asked the person that was on the phone are you required to show ID to the driver. The person on the phone told me no that it wasn‚Äôt required. Even though the driver asked for my ID multiple times. After that had happened I tried to get in contact with Lyft which was very had. Their customer service is absolutely horrible. The next day I received an email from Lyft saying that they had deactivated my account because of feedback say that I might not be of age. And in ordered to reactive my account I would need to send them a photo ID. Which I did. I wouldn‚Äôt ride with Lyft anymore and would never tell anyone else to use the app. Use Uber instead.	negative

Although I‚Äôve noticed an attempt to improve the Shared algorithm so you‚Äôre not diverted to pick someone up that is a mile behind you when your destination is only a mile away, it‚Äôs still not enough to compete with the precision and efficiency Uber‚Äôs app gives its drivers and passengers. 

This app is horrible. Drivers are constantly annoyed with its Shared functionality which in turn causes passengers, like myself, to have a frustrating experience. I like my drivers through Lyft and time is generally not an issue for me when I‚Äôm using the app. When I need to be somewhere on time, I use UberX. The source of my frustration is the app‚Äôs sluggish interface, inaccurate gps, and infidelity to parameters established by drivers (like when to stop Shared passenger add-ons so passengers don‚Äôt get canceled on). 

I switched to Lyft when Uber‚Äôs gender pay gap was big news, but, come on Lyft. Don‚Äôt give conscientious users a subpar product. Going on a hiatus until Lyft improves exponentially."	positive

2901	552602056	education	5	As an educator, it‚Äôs a fantastic tool to use in the classroom, ESPECIALLY for parent communication. I utilize the tool box constantly! I back up my attendance with this app.  The random feature helps give the students a fair shot for answering a question without having the waste money on popsicle sticks; plus, the kids love seeing the names cycle through on the SmartBoard in anticipation on who it will stop on. I consistently use the timer for morning play, math & ELA rotations, work that needs to be wrapped up in a timely manner, and snack time! I have been L O V I N G the new addition of adding an event to remind parents of special events coming up and the reminders that get sent out. The ONLY thing I wish this app had (which I am sure is in the making) is having it being utilized as a platform for parents to view and sign up for conferences or to volunteer inside the classroom. They would be able to see the possible times, which times are already booked and what is available for them to sign up for right there. This way it eliminates the back and forth email communication or playing phone tag. Other than that, I love this app. It allows families to see what kind of day their child is having. I post pictures of the kids engaged in any activity that are happening that day and the parents love it! (Especially those who have separation anxiety) Keep up the great work!	positive
2902	552602056	education	5	This app is amazing !!!!!!! When I am at home or at work and my daughter is at school and I am curious about how her day is going, all I have to do is open this app and look up her report for the day. Her teachers will mark her for either being really good, neutral, or disruptive, which allows me to know how my child‚Äôs school day is going. They do this throughout the entire day. The teachers will also post pictures of the class and what they are doing throughout the day which is always fun to see. This app also gives me the ability to communicate directly with her teacher, without having to send an email. Not only does it allow me to communicate with her teacher, it also gives me the ability to message anybody that is working with my child in the school. Whether it be a counselor, the nurse, the principal, anyone that works in the school, I am able to communicate with. This app was a complete game changer for me. My daughter is developmentally delayed and this app has literally given me so much peace of mind I don‚Äôt know what I would do without it. This has taken away so much stress that I have about wondering how my child is doing at school during the day and I‚Äôm very grateful for this app. I think it should be made available to every single school in the whole world. THANKS DOJO!!!!	positive
2903	552602056	education	2	"There have been 5 updates since I reported the loss of getting notifications on my iPhone 8 plus. I was told to reinstall the app despite this issue being recognized as a bug that needs fixing. It still has not been fixed and these vague release notes leave a lot to be desired. 

As for the app use, it's a mom's nightmare if you have special needs children. If you can not ask your child what happened at school this app will leave you even more baffled. Teachers are allowed to leave unexplained negative feedback. Yes it is teacher responsibility to use it fairly but I feel this app and it's setup makes poor communicating teachers even lazier. I am expected to write *them* notes that they do NOT respond to when they mark points off, cause simply telling me makes too much sense üôÑ So how about this- stop letting teachers just lazily leave negative feedback WITHOUT notes. It should REQUIRE a note. If my child isn't doing anything worth writing about it shouldnt warrant losing points either. 
Messages should have a priority setting because I am starting to think my child's teachers can't read the way they dodge messages. It's ridiculous and there should be more accountability built-in to it's use cause students are not the only bullies at school. Now we just have a bunch of lazy teachers content with bare minimum forms of communication. This app could require more of teachers, otherwise it's worsening communication and behavior problems."	negative
2904	552602056	education	2	"I‚Äôve used this app for 3 years now.  As a parents I see a lot of room for improvement.  1.  I am not notified via text and no way I have found to be notified-  I am very busy and I don‚Äôt enjoy needing to go to yet 1 more app to look at my kids progress or homework etc.  adds more work for me and not worth it.  2. It‚Äôs very elementary.  As my son moved to upper elementary - they still use it but now there‚Äôs no progress on him- they find it‚Äôs too beneath the grade level which I agree on. 3. I like the  anonymity    other apps gives me and still allows me to communicate w other parents - like to remind them it‚Äôs the teacher bday etc.  this app offer nothing like that.  4. I have to have the app!  I have plenty of storage space now but some parents don‚Äôt!  And I hear complaints often that they don‚Äôt have room for yet another app- other programs allows communication via text and no need for the app!  They send sms!   My kids are 3rd and 4th grade.  This apps has potential to grow w the students yet it has not!! Please consider adding features for age progression.  And I‚Äôm trying the at home feature- would have been great when my kids were younger but at their ages the monsters and points don‚Äôt mean near as much as the cool
Games they could be playing.  Over all- the younger the kid the better and only communication with teachers and no way to make a play date w a classmate even between students!  Please consider adding features !"	positive
2905	552602056	education	3	"The ClassDojo app is fantastic for staying up to date on last minute changes, or events that are coming up. It makes it easy to contact your child‚Äôs teachers via text, as well as seeing how your child is doing behavioral wise and if they handed in their homework. The Dojo points given by your child‚Äôs teachers is a great way to express this.

However, the reason I‚Äôm rating this app 3‚≠êÔ∏è is due to having to pay for the ability to give your child Dojo points at home for chores or listening etc. This is an education app. The ability to give Dojo points at home to your child should be accessible to all parents. Not everyone can afford the price you‚Äôre requesting for parents to pay. The price is a bit outrageous. In today‚Äôs society getting our child to attend school, especially our older children, is difficult already. Why not use the Dojo points at home system for pure encouragement so that your child can see their growth, in hopes they continue to go to school and stay out of trouble. 

If the Dojo points at home part of the app needs to have a price tag, it should be one that is based on society as a whole. Perhaps it should be based on the lower income families, seeing as they are the families that the charter schools are geared towards, in order for their children to have better education for a brighter future."	positive
2906	552602056	education	4	I love the most recent changes to the student accounts, especially the ease in switching for students now. I would like to see a more streamlined process of posting pictures and videos. Right now, they can take a picture or video, add a caption, talk over the picture explaining or draw on it. Once they click the little blue airplane, they have to select their name again (even tho they are already on their own account) and then click post. I think the airplane on the previous screen should suffice in posting it. If there were to be another screen, maybe just give the option of being able to post the same picture to another student account like before. Sometimes my students are partners and they shouldn‚Äôt have to take two separate pictures for their work. I also would like some sort of feature where I can toggle on a record keeping of who is posting. For example, I might want to have students post a picture or video of their center for the day- I‚Äôd love to see a quick easy way to filter who has and has not posted to their own account during that time frame. It would be so helpful, especially when I have some centers I give students two or more days to do. Just some ideas! Thanks.	positive
2907	552602056	education	4	We used Dojo at a different school and the difference was huge. My first experience was really great. We only saw only items that were related to our specific classroom and those that were sent by the principal and vice principal or reminders that were sent out for the whole school. This school We see every post for every class whether or not it is related to our classroom. Also purchasing the premium program so you can do dojo points at home was pretty useless. It does not interact with the schools character development process. So basically you make up the rules on your own and you have to find incentives to prompt your student into the behavior that you want your student to have. It was not worth the amount of effort it takes to develop a program at home that may conflict what is being done at school. Also there is no way to check on what your student is getting rewards for. All I know is that on Friday he gets to spend his Dojo points to buy trinkets from the ‚ÄúDojo Store‚Äù or change his login Dojo character. This program has so much potential, but it is riddled with missed opportunities for parents to be informed and included in their students learning experience. Very, very disappointed.	negative
2908	552602056	education	5	I'm a first year teacher in a special education 5th grade class and the behavior system I was using just wasn't cutting it. It wasn't effective for me to cross the classroom and stop my lessons to give my students reinforcements. Now I keep class dojo connected to the smart board at all times. The tap their naps in the morning to clock in for attendance. I give them points and demerits that I designed according to my needs which play a positive or negative sound. If a student earns three points in one day I give them a ticket to the classroom store. If the class gets more then 30 points I give them a class reward. The students see where the stand when it comes to their individual behavior and can see the effect they have on the group. The records they keep make report cards a breeze when it comes to marking students behavior. Parents stay connected and send messages through the app. This is all just the features of the website! The app offers added bonuses when used in tandem. The toolkit is a lifesaver with so many amazing things that it would take all day to describe them. This app is worth it a thousand times over!	positive
2909	552602056	education	5	"I use Dojo in my middle and high school classes. It allows me to track how students are participating in my class. I can keep track how often students come to class unprepared or are off task, and I can also reward them for working hard or persevering. At the end of the quarter, I run a report through Dojo, which gives me a percentage for each student. That percentage is used for a test grade called Participation. 
I can also connect parents. They see how their kids participate in class, so there are no surprises. I can also post private pictures that only the parents I think had particular class can see. I share pictures of students doing fun activities in class. Also, if they learn something particularly interesting, I post about it So the parents know ‚Äúwhat happened at school today.‚Äù I enjoy giving parents the opportunity to increase communication with their student regarding school. 
This app also helps me with group work in my class. The tools option gives me ability to randomly split students into groups. The students respond well to Dojo, and this extrinsic motivation really gets them going."	positive
2910	552602056	education	2	It has become increasingly frustrating to search since there is no search function! So I have to scroll through all the posts and hopefully find the one I was looking for. It makes it even harder since the post are listed as how many days ago it was. For instance a post will say 3d or 2w ago why can‚Äôt it be listed with the specific date? Now I have to look in the calendar to see how many days or weeks ago it was. Also you can‚Äôt click on the teachers name to view all the posts that teacher has made. For example I was trying to find an announcement the principal sent some time ago. It would make sense if I found a recent post and click on her name it would bring up all the announcements she made but you can‚Äôt. A suggestion to help the teachers that are new to this kind of technology when they make a post make them place a title, maybe put a reminder if they post a video with links in the video to put the links separate in the post. I have a teacher who is posting just link after link with no way of knowing what subject it is, which makes it even harder to go back and view past lessons. With these small improvements and guidance for new teachers using the app this will be a great classroom app. Everything else works as expected.	positive
2911	552602056	education	1	"Apparently, ‚ÄúMore things still to come :)‚Äù can be properly translated as: look forward to dozens upon dozens of future update notes that will continue to read ‚ÄúMore things still to come :)‚Äù without the developers delivering any change of substance whatsoever.

We‚Äôve been waiting for years for a very simple tweak: the ability to edit/subtract points directly without using the ‚Äúneeds work‚Äù feature in 1-5 point increments. As it stands right now, it is virtually impossible to use Class Dojo with a classroom store or token economy. For example: if a student purchases an item that costs 150 points, then the only way to subtract that number of points from his account is to create a special category within ‚Äúneeds improvements with a value of -5, and then hit that button 30 times. Now multiply similarly priced purchases by 20 or more students each week, and the impracticality becomes overwhelming. 

This app is a great concept and is a powerful, fun motivator. But we have suggested the ‚Äúedit points‚Äù feature  for years and have received plenty of ‚Äúwe‚Äôll take that under advisement‚Äù promises from customer reps, only to receive countless updates without this game changing  tweak included. Until the developers take customer feedback seriously, I will forever be searching for a viable replacement."	positive
2912	552602056	education	5	"Overall, I love so much about this app! The customer support is wonderful, the points system is great for behavior management, the videos are awesome for social emotional support and the portfolios are a great way to show student progress. 

Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt had as much success as I hoped making this my only form of communication with parents. There is something inadequate about the messaging system that makes it unreliable for parents to receive messages. I don‚Äôt know if this is because of technical errors on the parents‚Äô side with notifications or something that Class Dojo can fix. I‚Äôve had several times when parents have missed an important message about a meeting, field trip or awards assembly. I also wish the group messaging could work like a text thread where all parents are included in responses. 
There also isn‚Äôt an option for volunteer sign ups, which is crucial at our school in the primary grades. Because of this, primary teachers use Bloomz and it is tricky for parents to manage both platforms if they have children in multiple classes."	positive
2913	552602056	education	5	This app is amazing and genius in every sense! I am able to see my son‚Äôs points at school and class photos his teacher posts! Keep up with announcements, message his teacher privately, and also give him points at home for good behavior and reward my son when he‚Äôs ready to cash in his points! It works soooo much better than anything else we have tried with positive and negative reinforcement. He is 8 and ADHD and he struggles with self control a lot. This really helps him SEE his week or month as a whole, and the comments the teacher leaves on his behavior... we read them every evening and go over why that happened. Or I praise him for the good things he did or the great score he got on his test! It just keeps parents more involved! And it‚Äôs awesome cause mom and dad get to both see it, so dad is always involved too. Dad can‚Äôt say he didn‚Äôt know or wasn‚Äôt informed because it‚Äôs right there on the app!!! If he didn‚Äôt look then he is held accountable as well. My only wish is that POINTS WERE DEDUCTED FOR NEGATIVE BEHAVIOR AT HOME. Not just a time out to talk about it.	positive
2914	552602056	education	4	"Excellent way to communicate any quick thing btw parent and teacher whether it is an FYI or ""Brian didn't sleep well last night so he may not interact as much"".  Especially helpful for parents of special needs kids to keep close communication with teacher and parent to help regulate a child's routine.  I've been able to get feedback from my son's teacher about his behavior throughout the day which is very helpful for me when giving him adhd medication when i need to note it's effects and what time of day.

The teacher is more likely to have the convenience to give me a quick text to inform me that my son had a meltdown at 10:30a right after so I could troubleshoot with her via text.

Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because i wish we could download data to save the progress.  Like the ratings the teacher gives daily are only available for like a week.  It would be nice to download to excel or something to see the progression and identify weakness or patterns in behaviors based on external factors."	positive
2915	552602056	education	5	"We enjoy the dojo app each and every school day! We receive messages and pictures of our child as he weaves his way thru the school year. He‚Äôs only in 2nd grade so all the messages aren‚Äôt going to be great one‚Äôs, however we can use these as tool to garner improvement and discipline as well. It really gives you a piece of mind when you can see what/ How your child is doing throughout our dreary work a day lives. I‚Äôm not sure all schools use the dojo app for their parents, I‚Äôm sure there are other apps out there that do basically the same thing, but dojo works just fine.
I‚Äôm glad they didn‚Äôt have anything like this when we were coming up in the school system, things seemed so much simpler back then. The children can‚Äôt even breathe wrong or it will be documented and reported to the parents nowadays. I think today‚Äôs youth will be better off for it. They will be more accountable and detail conscious."	positive
2916	552602056	education	5	This program has revolutionized my teaching style. I use this program as a point system in my class. When a student has a certain number of points then s/he may sit in a certain chair. I also use this program to individually correspond with my parents daily regarding behavior challenges on particular students; but most importantly, I push out at up to 3 good behavior messages to my well behaved kids, so that I can give an extra thanks to these kids for being such great students. (Which in turn helps my classroom climate‚Äù). I also love using the Class Stories aspect of this program. The photos keep the parents feeling connected and I have a pictorial record of my class activities. Dojo offers all this and more free of charge plus they have no ads! This program has helped me improve my classroom climate. Thank you for the use of this program.	positive
2917	552602056	education	5	"I LOVE this app SO much! We unschool our kiddos (8, 4 & 1) and this is the easiest way to track what we are doing. I‚Äôm not great at keeping notes, planners or lesson plans (and we honestly don‚Äôt teach that way or any ‚Äútypical‚Äù way), but this app makes it super simple to show the work we do on a daily basis. 

Quick pictures of field trips (children‚Äôs museum, zoo, science center, library visits, meet-ups, etc. etc.) with an explanation of what was learned. 

I also take pictures of the books they‚Äôre currently reading or audio books, podcast etc. 

I also am able to track behavior/life skills/chores via this app since it‚Äôs framework is pretty flexible. They get points for daily tasks around the house...at school it would likely be stuff like raising your hand, being kind...whatever and for us it‚Äôs getting dressed, brushing teeth, limiting screen time to 2 hours or less, being respectful, returning library books to the ‚Äúreturn‚Äù bin when they‚Äôre done, etc. 

Point is...app is super flexible and I love it!!! I can‚Äôt say enough good things about it!

Oh and also...I have some relatives that aren‚Äôt onboard with homeschooling (not their choice or business) and a super quick way to show them how much we truly do is to send them a parent invite so they can view what I track here..they‚Äôve gotten off my back since üòÅ"	positive
2918	552602056	education	5	"I am a preschool teacher who holds open communication with my students parents as extremely important. I‚Äôve recently began using class dojo and love it! I can update my parents throughout the day on their child‚Äôs behavior, share pictures with them, and post reminders and information on a the class story for all parents to see (which is great because they rarely read the ones I post in the classroom). I also love that I can message the parents directly and vice verse without having to share my personal contact information. I would suggest this app to every teacher preschool age and older. 
***my only suggestion for improvement would be that the app designers make a way for parents to download the pictures of their children shared with them. My parents have complained about having to screenshot the pictures they wanted saved."	positive
2919	552602056	education	5	Class Dojo is a great classroom management tool that also allows for students to safely post their accomplishments for their classmates and parents to see.   Like the fact that we can message parents about issues at school, and that we have the OPTION to write a note for any positive or negative feedback.  Which teacher on the planet has time to document EVERY moment in the day?  The messaging system is great for a blast to all parents or individual ones.  I‚Äôm  happy that you can sent photos and videos of student work and participation in class.  If you‚Äôre a mentor at your school, then you have the option to communicate with all parents not just the ones in your class, this is great for school-wide announcements.  The app has improved over the years, BUT I wouldn‚Äôt mind additional icons - even though you can upload your own.	positive
2920	552602056	education	3	"I don't understand how this app gets 5 stars. 
I‚Äôve been using iOS version since September 2019 my son goes to Kindergarten. However, at the student‚Äôs report page, teacher input comments but it shows ‚ÄúTalking after whole cl.....‚Äù. My first thought was users should be able to view the whole description but it‚Äôs somehow cut off on the screen. I tried to click on the description to see if it‚Äôll expand the full content but it doesn‚Äôt. If this app is about how we understand our kids are doing in school from teacher comments, then showing the full point description should be a very feature which this app failed.

Secondly, it‚Äôs a suggestion that right now I can only see the parents from my son‚Äôs classroom when they comment on teacher‚Äôs posts. I do hope the app will include a  ‚Äúparents connection‚Äù feature so when it‚Äôs needed, parents can message each other and get connected for social or emergency purpose."	negative
2921	552602056	education	5	I work at an at risk school and communicating with parents has never been so easy!!  This app has made it so easy to share positive feedback with family, share exciting events in class, keep parents up to date on our new learning goals, less handouts and creates an environment where my families can interact with each other and share fun ways to practice skills at home!  This was a game changer for me. I work at a school where it is hard to get parent involvement, but 100% of my students have at least one family member on Dojo. I love the class wall where I can share news while group instead of creating newsletters or handouts. Each kid has a personal wall where I can share their success stories that only them and their family see. It‚Äôs like a scrapbook for their success. Messages allows me to talk to parents in private. Love this program!!	positive
2922	552602056	education	4	"This is the second app of its kind I‚Äôve had for school-related stuff. My kids had Seesaw in years prior at a former school, and I really enjoyed that I only saw info that pertained to my kids in particular, unless it was something the whole school needed to see in Seesaw.
In dojo, I see everything from every teacher, it seems. I also wish I had the ability to unfollow some people, as in instagram, in order to not see some of the overzealous school personnel who share things that have nothing to do with my kids whatsoever. With 4 kids in 3 different schools, who each have their own list of extracurriculars, and my spouse and I having our own multiple responsibilities outside of home and work... The unnecessary info sharing is just tedious, which leads me to ignoring the app and therefore occasionally missing vital information, as it seems to be the elementary school‚Äôs primary form of communication."	positive
2923	552602056	education	5	I have been wanting to write an email to let you know how grateful I am for Class DoJo, I have been using it for little more than four years in my classroom. Class DoJo has helped lessen negative behaviors and encourage cooperation within and outside the classroom. The Big Ideas are AMAZING. I use them to set the tone each week of what social-emotional goal we are going to work on and then share it with parents in class story, so they can see what the ‚Äúdip‚Äù and other key phrases are. The Portfolios have been a life saver during this switch to digital learning from home. I will continue to use Class DoJo for the remaining years of teaching and share my praise for this wonderful and thoughtful program. I can access my account on any device and is so user friendly. I can‚Äôt wait until you can purchase a MoJo stuffy I will be the first order!!!	positive
2924	552602056	education	4	"I love this app for communicating with parents about the classroom but there are two major issues that never seem to get fixed with updates 
1) the messages are all together in one long line. Sometimes I am talking to a parent about an issue through the messenger and then have to send a message to all the parents about another issue. This all parent message ends up in the middle of the conversation and either doesn‚Äôt get read or we lose a comment in the middle. It‚Äôs a bad set up and messages should be separated. 
2) half the time, for whatever reason, audio from videos does not play on iPhones. There is no reason to it, but half the time you hear it and half the time you don‚Äôt. Parents have the same issue and comment that they can‚Äôt hear directions. Please, tech people working on this app, figure out what the issue is and fix it!"	negative
2925	552602056	education	5	This app has given us parents the capability to see what our children have and are continuing to learn in their classrooms‚Äô. This app give us the pleasure to view fun pictures and videos of  classroom activities as well as the amazing programs, super fun social gatherings and awareness our school/teachers are bringing our children every day/ week. We all know the feeling when we ask our children, ‚Äú what did you learn/ do at school today?‚Äù Their answer is, ‚Äú I don‚Äôt know...I don‚Äôt remember...nothing!‚Äù  Well, this app allows teachers to give us some of what our kids are learning and more. I too can send a personal message to my daughter‚Äôs teachers‚Äô and get a response right away. There is no longer a communication barrier that keeps us disconnected from our children‚Äôs education. I love this app!! Just amazing!!!	positive
2926	552602056	education	4	From a teacher‚Äôs perspective, class dojo makes classroom management, incentives, and communication with parents easy. But after using classdojo for the first time this year, I don‚Äôt think that I will use it next year in my classroom. I believe the downfall of being so closely connected to parents and so easily accessible is that the parents start messaging you at 9:00 at night expecting you to give them an immediate answer concerning homework. What‚Äôs worse is that some parents start using the dojo text messaging system as a way to rudely vent to the teacher with various complaints about the school, her, etc. I might use it again in the distant future, but I really believe that some serious parameters need to be put in that manages parent responses. Having a text- message style system of communicating takes away the professionalism that is needed between teacher and parent.	negative
2927	552602056	education	2	My child is 5 & I love seeing what he is up to in class however, he dosent have major responsibilities that I track with ClassDojo points. We go to sleep fairly early and use my phone as an alarm, so I set my volume to loud every night and am frequently disturbed by ClassDojo asking me if he earned a point today. No where on the app is there a setting to only notify me when his teacher posts. In order to have notifications on, this comes with being notified EVERY NIGHT between 9:30-10pm to ask if he has earned a class dojo point. At the very least, the notification could go off in the morning to ask me about his previous day opposed to in the middle of the night. My spouse and I both have this app on our phone and we just wish that this was an optional feature. What could have been a potentially great app is now tainted by this experience and has me counting down to his last day of school this year so that I can feel the relief of deleting this app.	positive

I caved and bought 1 month to see if behavior would improve at home with the earned points and rewards. So far this app has been amazing at inspiring her to behave better to earn points and therefore also rewards. Everything is so personalized and easy to modify. Even my older daughter is using it (which is free with the added subscription) and doing great. 

My only complaint is that every tine I give a point, the screen minimizes and I have to hit the monster icon again. I tend to do points in a lump so this feature is annoying. It should allow you to pick several accomplishments without kicking you off that screen. Love the noise that goes with the points though!"	positive
2929	552602056	education	5	I teach 4Th. grade. At first glance I thought this app would be too childish for my students. However, I was surprised to find they absolutely love it. Their parents can see their behavior in real time. They challenge each other to top score of the day. The tool kit is amazing and I use so many of the tools they provide. I love the growth mindset videos, they are short and easy to use. The best part is the discussion points. I share pictures on our classroom story of projects, or helpful hints for parents with homework which make communication with all parents at once simple and quick. Finally, the installation and adding or removing students is super low tech and absolutely anyone can do it! Thank you ClassDoJo for creating such a helpful app that teacher like me can use to positively impact change in our classrooms!	positive
2930	552602056	education	5	I‚Äôve been using this since I started teaching three years ago. Recently we‚Äôve been using this platform constantly at my school because of the quarantine. Although there was a slow period when everyone was trying to get on at the same time, this app is fantastic! Awesome way to stay connected with the school news and parents. The students keep connected in my room and I can add all their specialty teachers so they can communicate with them too. The only thing I‚Äôd wish to see with this app is the ability to edit a live document that you share on there. For example: posting the time slots for parent teacher conferences and parents being able to see as slots get taken up. That would be really beneficial and would make those events in the year much easier.	positive
2931	552602056	education	4	I will admit that when I first heard of this ‚ÄúClass Dojo‚Äù, I thought it was martial arts. However, after talking to other parents about this app and my husband and I using this app ourselves for 2 years now, WE love it! We especially love it when the teachers actually USE the app :-). I get that it can be difficult to post on dojo for each child, every day. I get it! I‚Äôd take every other day, honestly. Such a great way to check on my child throughout the day and gauge whether or not she should be rewarded for a good day or not, because according to my 2nd grader, EVERY day is a good day...not! I‚Äôm able to discuss things with her teacher or ask questions that I simply don‚Äôt have time to come into the school every day to ask. This helps a full time working mom soo much. A must use! I‚Äôm going to miss it when she gets to the grade where they no longer use class dojo.	positive
2932	552602056	education	3	I loved this app when it originally came out because it keeps me up to date, my son created his monster and I get to stay in touch with my 1st sons teachers. It was awesome when it was basic but now all this extra dumb crap had been added so they can receive money. It‚Äôs not fair to my kids coming after my first that won‚Äôt be able to customize a character or certain tools that were free are being charged. I can‚Äôt customize girl creature for her because you want us to pay you for it. This app is not that valuable, this was also a suggestion from the school. Pretty soon this app is going to charge money for keeping in contact with the teachers and receiving basic updates. There not that much freedom in this app anymore. I‚Äôm sorry the moment you started asking for money you showed your greed and I don‚Äôt appreciate that.	negative
2933	552602056	education	4	We love ClassDojo. The speech therapist in my son class suggest us to use ClassDojo to communicate. When the teach share the picture/clip of my son at school, it makes me feel happy. It‚Äôs fast and easy app to use. I hope all the teacher will use it to communicate with the parents. I‚Äôm happy with the App. However, I have some suggestions. I think if you can make it to communicate as a group that we can discuss and see the same message at the same time, it would be nice. My husband has one account and I have another account. Seem like the teacher have to post 2 times for both of us. If we can make a room as a team so we can discuss same things with many people who involved as a team, teacher, speech therapist, OT and parents in one shot. Could you please try to make it happen....Thank you,	positive
2934	552602056	education	5	"ClassDojo is a staple in classrooms across the country. It really is a great tool for classroom management, but that doesn‚Äôt just mean behavior! Because it‚Äôs built in a way to allow flexibility, you can use ClassDojo in many ways. 

Over the pay few years I have found that it is the absolute BEST way to keep in contact with parents. It has all of the convenience of text messaging, without ever having to give out your personal phone number. But it is actually more powerful than many messaging apps because it has some features that are designed specifically for the teacher/parent and teacher/student relationship. 

I will continue using ClassDojo for as long as it is available because it really is a fantastic resource."	positive
2935	552602056	education	1	"My biggest gripe with this app is lack of modern features. How hard would it be to add notification customization? I personally don‚Äôt want to be notified when other teachers or school staff post nonsense on the Instagram style timeline. Why can‚Äôt the developers have options to only notify me when something important happens, like a direct message or a post by my child‚Äôs actual teacher. The only notification options are through iOS itself and that‚Äôs just on or off. 

Also, let the user choose if they want email notifications on top of app notifications. This overly general notification style is outdated and makes me want to turn notifications completely off. But, of course I can‚Äôt turn notifications off because then I‚Äôll miss a rare post that I actually need to be notified of. 

For an app that‚Äôs used nationwide by schools, it‚Äôs disappointing that the parent company can‚Äôt find a better app developing team to bring this app into the 2018s."	negative

2937	552602056	education	3	"No ability to send voice messages like you‚Äôre able to on the Remind app & no ability for a group message with the teacher and parents/guardians so it always leaves one parent having to screenshot and relay to the next parent. This seems like it should have been a very standard feature. 

I should be able to create a message with my child‚Äôs teacher, myself and my husband so we can all message and see updates in real time but because there‚Äôs no option to do this I‚Äôm aggravatingly ALWAYS having to screenshot my husband messages from the teacher. 

Voice messages should also be a thing for this app. It‚Äôs quick and something parents can do on the go if need be and allows teachers to communicate more effectively. Sometimes, it‚Äôs better to hear the tone of someone for some messages than to read them."	positive
2938	552602056	education	2	For about 3 years I consistently used Class Dojo as my main behavior tracker. That little ‚ÄúDing‚Äù made my students behave wonderfully! After taking a year sabbatical, I am now looking back into using it for homeschooling my own children. I am SO disappointed that Class Dojo is requiring a subscription to use most features, mainly the point system that I loved. I think the Beyond School feature sounds awesome but again, a monthly subscription is not in my budget.,I‚Äôd be willing to pay if it was a lower one-time fee. But $60 a year to reward my kids? No thank you. Even if I was still teaching I wouldn‚Äôt pay that. Teachers already have to pay for every little thing. Why not keep what was free in the first place free? (Unlimited skill goals, points, etc). I love Class Dojo, it‚Äôs an amazing tool. I‚Äôm just so disappointed they are now charging so much. I will not be upgrading and will have to settle with something else.	positive
2939	552602056	education	5	"I teach pre k special education....Class Dojo is the best. I started using it last year - My personal kids teachers used in gen ed for upper grades but I thought that it would be perfect for my class. The parents love it, they get pictures, videos, I can snap a picture of flyers coming home for parents to look for In backpacks. 
Due to confidentiality it is not an environment we typically have parent volunteers, Class Dojo gives parents direct connection to their child and allows them to see what we do, activities, and I customized the points to include IEP goals. 
I am able to message parents and they can reach me without giving out my phone number, which has been nice. 
I just can‚Äôt say enough about how much this has added to my classroom. I love love love it!"	positive

2941	552602056	education	4	I‚Äôve been using this app for about three years now. I think it‚Äôs great that my son‚Äôs music, art and Spanish teachers are using the app as well as his main teachers. I love being able to reach out to them at any time and they are very good at responding. However, I would like the option to unfollow posts and stories from previous teachers. Even though they have archived their class and I can‚Äôt message them, I still see their new posts this year mixed in with his current teachers‚Äô posts and it gets confusing since the previous teacher‚Äôs posts are irrelevant to my child. I would also like the option to download pics, interact with other parents in my child‚Äôs class. Other than, keep the updates coming, you guys are doing great!	positive
2942	552602056	education	2	"Most of the reviews are only about the school side so don‚Äôt believe this app is a five star app!!!

I tried the trial thinking the home side of this app was like the school side as far as points. It is not. If you are like me and would like your child to understand consequences of bad behavior as well as what happens with good behavior this app is not for you. For the school side you can give and take points and see them in the report. In the home side to take points is to erase the good (in the report) that your child has done. This means that in the report you can no longer see the good that your child has done and the report will look like all that is there is bad marks. I have cancelled my subscription and chosen to just creat my own point system at my house. Don‚Äôt forget the school side is free to parents. This app is not worth the money and I urge people not to subscribe until they fix this issue."	positive
2943	552602056	education	4	With my child transitioning from a familiar preschool to going to a new school (as in new build) and being promoted to K I was nervous. But the school providing this app as a way to keep in contact with the teachers and your child is comforting. To add, open communication with not just her teachers but with the administration and other parents as well. Followed by getting fingertip updates of my child‚Äôs development is definitely a major plus as well. The only downfall is to pay for the app in order to have complete and full access to all the tools the app has to offer. The same way the teacher is able to reward the students, as parents we can too for a fee! Other than that, it‚Äôs a great to use. Thanks for designing it for us. It brings so much comfort and communication!	positive
2944	552602056	education	5	As a teacher I love this app. I use it everyday and the students enjoy it also. I can post class work for the parents to see so that they are aware of homework and topics coved in class. I can also post pictures or have parents email me if they have any questions. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about the app is what students can do. They can change their monsters and post pictures or notes that I can approve or delete. Students can‚Äôt see the class story if they have forgotten homework or upcoming events. It‚Äôs also a bit clumsy if you have to print student and parent codes to send home. These are very small things and do not take away from a great app. I have and would recommend to any teacher or school to use.	positive
2945	552602056	education	5	This app is absolutely my favorite app on my phone!! It allows me to talk with my child‚Äôs teacher in real time like I am texting a friend!! I ask a question and 15-30 at the most I have an answer instead of have to wait half if not till the end of the day!! She can also share photos and her day to day classroom progress in a flash!! And my kid has asthma so if she is having issues it is so fast and easy for her to shot me a message to let me know she is having an attack!! This app is full of awesomeness I could go on for two more pages!! You must check it out if you like to be update to date about your child‚Äôs education or if your a teacher wanting an super easy way to communicate and share with parents!!	positive
2946	552602056	education	3	"I‚Äôm a teacher, and my school uses this app exclusively. I like features like messaging and recording videos to communicate with parents. These are fairly quick and easy. However there are some annoying facets that I think would be easy to fix and make Dojo more user- friendly. 

1. Allow teachers to edit and organize classes. I‚Äôm a music teacher, so I am a co-teacher with 21 classes, but they‚Äôre all disorganized. I wish I could group them together into the order in which I see them. 

2. Allow teachers to move student avatars in the app. I would find this very useful in creating seating charts for my 21 classes. Right now, I have to toggle between Dojo and another app for the seating charts. Let‚Äôs get this all in one app please!

3. When recording a video, allow teachers to turn their camera to landscape view. As it is now, if I rotate my iPad sideways, Dojo keeps the video in the same portrait orientation. I‚Äôve learned the hard way (and embarrassingly) that the app won‚Äôt rotate the video. 

4. Allow cut and paste functions. I sometimes send the same message to multiple classes, but I have to re-type every time. Also, I can‚Äôt figure out how to send a message to my co-teacher. Please add them to the list of possible recipients!"	positive
2947	552602056	education	5	Using ClassDojo has been the first example of feeling like a team in the growth and education of my grandson.  I wish it had been available when my children were school aged.  The ability to communicate directly with teachers and para‚Äôs has been 100% positive daily as opposed to parent/teacher conferences. The ability to work together in positive times as well as difficult times is priceless. Reports, messages, and the child's story are so valuable in keeping communications open and clear from all those involved.  The result is a better education experience for the student, and a partnership between parents, teachers, para‚Äôs, counselors, administration and classmates.	positive
2948	552602056	education	4	"I have been a loyal Class Dojo user for many years. It is a great way to communicate with parents as well as help manage behavior. I have encouraged many of my coworkers to make the switch and those that haven‚Äôt yet wish they had at the start of the new school year. 

I would love to have an option to edit points by entering numbers. I have my students cash in their points for different things and it is always a hassle to reset their points and then add back their ‚Äúchange‚Äù. Example, one student had 36 points and wanted to cash in for something that was 20 points. After resetting the points, I then had to add back one point at a time until it got to 16. It would be nice to be able to manually enter points instead of having to do one at a time."	positive
2949	552602056	education	4	"(Oh I stand corrected! Notifications were just pushed all the way out to my watch. Heavenly. Please excuse all references below to to topic of notifications and email, still need group chat. Awesome nonetheless)

A fifth star for group chat and push notifications!

I‚Äôm a parent with an autistic child and we just got signed up. I couldn‚Äôt be happier that an easier way to interact with my child‚Äôs learning progress and stay in touch with the teacher.

It would be very beneficial to be able to message my spouse and the teacher in a single chat. 

Maybe I just didn‚Äôt see how.

I also don‚Äôt want my teacher to have to send the same message twice, once for each parent.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll understand how confusing and time consuming it will be without it.

In addition I did not get an Apple Push Notification when a message from the teacher was posted.

I don‚Äôt want to continually get emails but would rather have the push on my iPhone.

I really hope that these exist and I‚Äôm just not seeing how to do them or that they are in the works so we can use them this school year.

Thanks for a great product. I can‚Äôt wait to advocate for the use of Class Dojo throughout his future school years."	positive
2950	552602056	education	5	I absolutely love using this app in the classroom. I have used it in several different classroom situations and it can truly be effective for many uses. Currently, I use ClassDojo to track classroom participation only. It is great to use from an iPad. Super quick, easy, and convenient. The only thing I would love to see added to the app is a way to show daily points opposed to only seeing the overall points accumulated. I would like to be able to see more data broken down by day. This would be helpful to monitor daily participation without having to reset points. It would also be easier to show parents specific days where their children were really good or if they were disruptive.	positive
2951	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	"This is the best use of a smartphone I know of. For anyone who runs, walks, bikes or does any activity that involves moving around outside this app is a perfect idea. I have used it for a long time now and wouldn't know what to do without it! Get it. You won't regret it.

This app is working well again for the most part.  There are still some features I don't like and the total separation (allegedly) of Apple Watch from the app on the iPhone seemed an overreaction to the inability to program them to work well together while other apps ran. Now, I am back to using the iPhone for Runkeeper. It still shows on the Watch but it doesn't track there. I run a different app on Watch as a backup because sometimes a glitch doesn't allow the workout to track right.
I used to be the biggest advocate of this app but now that it is part of Asics I am less impressed by it. Like Map My Run (now Under Armour) the quality does not benefit from a bigger company grabbing up the apps. I would say now it remains my favorite but still lacks the simple matter of showing my heart rate (as read by my Apple Watch) on my running screen. Sometimes it makes an appearance when I am walking but I would love to have it show when running but no such luck. And yes, I have made that selection in the app so there is really no excuse for it other than weak programming.
I'd say get it if you are a runner but don't expect too much."	positive
2952	300235330	health_and_fitness	3	I‚Äôll be honest, I prefer zombies, run as an app as I‚Äôm not a professional runner and I like things to keep me motivated. I downloaded this app because it said it worked with zombies run. It does not. I‚Äôve been trying to synchronize my runs for a week now and I haven‚Äôt been successful. This is important because there is a challenge that I signed up for where you have to run 5k 13 times by a certain time period. It does not count manual entries. I have to manually put in my workouts since my runs don‚Äôt synchronized with this app. So the four I did this week don‚Äôt count. I do like you can choose different voices to tell you times. I am disappointed that the drill sergeant voice is so nice. A ‚Äúis that all you got?! my grandmother can run faster than you!‚Äù Type feedback would be preferable than what he currently says. I wanted a voice that would make me work harder, the drill sergeant voice failed to deliver on that front. I do like you can keep track of your shoes and how many miles you‚Äôve put on them, but it won‚Äôt allow you to really edit the miles you put on it directly. Training programs must be paid for which is 40 a year instead of zombies run‚Äôs 8 a year (and you can technically unlock features for free). Overall, I‚Äôll stick with zombies, run! App. It lacks some of the few features I like from Runkeeper, but is more engaging for newer runners, is 1/5 the price a year, and has a story.	positive
2953	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	"I‚Äôm only using the free version so I can‚Äôt give it 5, not knowing what it‚Äôs like to have the full version. For the free version, it does a great job of keeping track of mileage and average pace and the number of runs or other exercise activities you've completed. The reminders to run are also great for keeping you motivated. Using the average pace is better than having it notify you of current pace at intervals, which seems more inconsistent and unreliable as it gave me wild variations throughout my runs. I like the challenges too. I run anywhere from 3-9 miles on a given day, about 3 times a week. It also has a training schedule if you need one to train for a marathon. I wish the list of alternative activities would include an option for me to customize and add one to the list instead of just having to pick ""other"" but maybe that comes with the paid version. Overall, the perfect app for a novice or avid runner. Not sure if it‚Äôs perfect for the regular marathoner but I used it on my half marathon and thought it was great. I like the more recent feature of it automatically detecting a pause in your workout so you don‚Äôt have to manually do it every time and refresh it when you start up again. That was a nuisance before. Glad they included that now."	positive
2954	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	"I previously rated this app with 5 stars (see below)   Since it will no longer allow use of the app without creating an account and logging in, I will be deleting Runkeeper and finding another app to use.  There are many running apps out there to choose from and I am willing to pay for a one-time purchase - as long as logging in is not a requirement. 

======= My previous review follows: ======

Love this app.  I opened the app for the first time, pressed start, and took off running.  Every 5 minutes, it reported my time, distance, and rate in minutes/mile for me to hear while I run. While running, it displays a map following my tracks. Also it displays stats during the run - which r not really needed to look at since I hear them every 5 min.  When finished running, i pressed stop and it recited a summary of my workout for me to listen to while I warmed down. Then allowed me to write notes about the workout before I saved it. There was no learning curve for using this app. It was very intuitive.  I can call up saved runs and view the map of my tracks as well as the stats.  It also compares all my runs and displays my best in a summary of all runs.  I have not created an account. And I'm still on version 5.5. There are many more features in this app which I have not felt the need to use yet."	positive
2955	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	"Used to be excellent. Paid again for premium service. First marathon coming up in 3 weeks. Been training using Runkeeper app to log training runs. Apple Watch 4 not predicted to last a full marathon for typical runner. Must carry phone to ensure recording full distance with all features and sharing location with others. But, since watch and iPhone 11 are no longer synced, no heart rate recording on phone Runkeeper app. Have to take phone out of armband to get any in-run data and then get phone back in armband, because watch no longer is synced. Real distraction causing slowing of pace. 
Another problem is that training programs are rigid. If you don‚Äôt train the exact number of weeks they prescribe, it won‚Äôt even let you start their program. Thus, no value in premium subscription Also, the map of your run will not go full screen on Safari, but does work in Firefox. Another app a friend in Japan has will allow an animation of your run over time, route, and elevation. Very sorry to say, avoid Runkeeper if you‚Äôre a serious runner. There has to be a better app, this is so useless given the most recent upgrade. Maybe they are planning on discontinuing support for Apple products because the app is becoming worse, not better. Truly regret relying on Runkeeper. I‚Äôll switch the day the marathon is over."	negative
2956	300235330	health_and_fitness	2	Started using this app in 2013. I‚Äôve logged 1,349 activities. But in the past two years, the app just randomly quits in the middle of a workout. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling, RE-installing. I‚Äôve tried on my watch and my phone and on various versions of iOS. There‚Äôs only one consistent thing about it... crashing. This evening I was going for a PR on running distance. I have a long sordid history of injuries so getting back out and running any kind of distance is big for me. Hitting a PR is an especially tall task given the fact that my orthopedist told me I‚Äôd never run again. I‚Äôve overcome a lot to get to the point where I am today. 1 mile away from my goal and the app crashed.  My watch battery was good. My music app was streaming music fine so I know I had a solid data connection. The app did what it does on just about every workout... it just randomly stops tracking the workout. This problem started about 2 years ago. At first it was random and rare. Then, it started happening more often. This year has been the worst since I‚Äôve been using it. If ASICS didn‚Äôt have the capital to stand behind the product they shouldn‚Äôt have invested. I‚Äôll have to try the PR again but record it on a reliable app.	negative
2957	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	"I tried Runkeeper, really I tried. Over the years I've had an Apple Watch I tried to rely on the watch app. I live the GPS tracking and the robust data in the phone app, but I simply can't use an app that is unreliable.

Specifically, when I use the native watch app I will regularly lose runs. I'll finish the run and try to stop it on the watch and the app will not Jake pausing, stopping and recording the run. At various points in the process it will just crash to the first screen and the run will not be recorded. This had happened MANY times and is utterly frustrating. This NEVER happens with the Apple Watch Workout app. It's not as fancy and detailed as Runkeeper, but it works reliably. At the end of the day that's more important.

The dad thing is that after leaving Runkeeper years ago due to this problem, I came back to it after getting a new Series 4 Apple Watch, certain that they must have fixed these problems over the years. Nope, still randomly loses runs. Doesn't crash as much which is good I guess, but the point of a fitness tracker is to accurately and consistently track your fitness. When it can't do that then it's worthless. Makes me sad, but later Runkeeper. Maybe these issues will get fixed in another 5 years or so..."	negative
2958	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	It was awesome before ASICS came along and made a bunch of GUI changes as well as sone other things that I can‚Äôt remember because it‚Äôs been so long. I‚Äôm sure there are way better running apps out there but I‚Äôve only been sticking with this one because I have over 800 long distance activities logged and I can‚Äôt wait to screen shot my 1,000. Ran nearly everyday for the past 5 to 7 years. The longest I had to go without running was unfortunately this year when I was in a severe accident fracturing multiple bones including my left foot. Happy to say I‚Äôm back on the pavement post fractured as of just a few days ago and I‚Äôve already logged 4 out of 5 days. I‚Äôm starting slow easing back into it running for now only 3 miles at a time.  It I‚Äôm sure in another couple of weeks I will be back into double digit miles!  Can‚Äôt wait!  I‚Äôm also originally from Boston but how in South Florida. When the startup was just a bunch of you guys and gals from Boston  I was all in. Love  this app but like I said loved it slightly better before some if the ASICS changes.	positive
2959	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	This app is probably the best Apple Watch app I have used so far in terms of accuracy of distance and current pace when your not using your phone. Although the current pace jumps back and forth a little much, it is very close to my actual pace. The face of the app in the watch can be changed while you run which is good and bad depending on if you accidentally hit the screen. The reason I did not give the app a five star is because it still can be improved significantly. You cannot customize the watch app on the phone app which can be frustrating. I‚Äôve tried to change it so there is no countdown before the run but there still is a 3 second delay anyways. When you first start a run the display takes a couple seconds to come up, and is also hard to stop when you are tired. I like the activity apps way of stopping and starting runs where you simultaneously press the power button and home button on the watch much more. This will make speed and interval workouts much easier to track.	negative
2960	300235330	health_and_fitness	3	"For a couple of months I‚Äôve been using Runkeeper and loved it. It‚Äôs simple but rich watch complication was just perfect. But over the past two weeks I‚Äôve had three runs that I‚Äôll start from my watch and see distance increase. However at a later time, like say when I know I‚Äôve hit my next mile, I‚Äôll check my time and the distance will have reset to 0.00. The timer is still going and luckily I run the same route in my neighborhood so I just have to get on a computer to fix my distance. But the point of this review is for users to beware that this app will spoil you and when it doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs quite frustrating by comparison. I will keep checking for updates both firmware and AppStore hoping that this issue disappears.

Update:
Tracked a 5K this morning from my watch, reviewed the stats as my 2nd fastest 5K on my phone. Then I went to my dashboard to see my week stats and the activity changed to a 0.09mi run lasting 35 seconds. So I‚Äôm officially done trusting this app. I will leave my rating because it really was awesome when it worked well."	positive
2961	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	Runkeeper went from having the best running app to having the worst.  With the release of version 10.3 they ruined a great running app.  Their intent with version 10.3 was to monitor your run using just the Apple Watch independent of your iPhone.   The Apple Watch is supposed to provide a few of audio cues. Heart rate is not one of them. At best on a 5 mile run your lucky if you get 2 audio cues.  When you finish your run you are supposed to sync your Apple Watch with your iPhone.  Syncing takes at least 15 minutes if it syncs at all.  If you try to monitor your run with your iPhone you can no longer sync your iPhone with your Apple Watch.  So no heart rate stats while using your iPhone. No way to visually look at your stats on your Apple Watch.  If you look at the reviews since the release of version 10.3 you will see they are almost all negative.  Runkeeper responds by saying they are working on the bugs.  If they are working on the bugs, which I would say is really a beta version of their app, why not retract it and bring back their previous version which was an app they can be proud about.  When they get 10.3 straighten out then re-release it.  Why continue to embarrass themselves and ASIC?	positive
2962	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	I was super excited about this app! I downloaded it because I‚Äôm trying to get into running and I needed some help doing so. I set t up for my first 5k. I loved the personal running coach right in my ear. I love that I can still play music while using this app. I loved the helpful tips and coaching. BUT.... when I went out for my 4th run, I discovered that it was no longer free. To go any father, to have any more coaching, I needed to pay a subscription. $35 for a year or $10/month. Of course I didn‚Äôt pay. Rather, I went back home... and I didn‚Äôt ru. For a week!! I couldn‚Äôt find anything else that I liked that was free. So I finally bit the bullet and got the subscription. Of course I can‚Äôt afford it. If I could, I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten an app! I would have gotten a gym membership! But they had me hooked and I needed motivation to run. I‚Äôm doing the 1 year subscription, and then I‚Äôm canceling. If I‚Äôm not running in my own in year I shouldn‚Äôt be running at all. Well played Run Keeper, well played.	positive
2963	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	"July30, 2919; I have been using the paid version and enjoy it. There are a few  things I will put on here because I am not electronic savvy and can‚Äôt figure out how to contact Runkeeper.  1-what happed to horse riding?  2-why do I have to pick an active for a goal-for example I want to set a distance goal. I have to pick from about 5 different activities. Well what if I walk one day and go for a hike the next day and after that I run. Only one of the activities are counted. 3-why is it so hard to contact you?  I really do enjoy the app. There are just a few things that I would like to see improved on. 

I really like this app. I am able to pace myself.  This app helps me to see see how fast I am walking real time.  I like the challenges. They help to keep me motivated. It is fun to see were you have walked using the map.  It would be nice though if it could sense that I stopped. It messes up my average pace when I stop and it keeps timing me. I just have the free version so far."	positive
2964	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	I absolutely love this app. I am not a runner and I used to hate running because the thought of it intimidated me so much. I didn't know what I was doing and I wasn't consistent because of that. This app provides guidance while you are running and let me tell you, it has made ALL the difference. There is a voice guiding you as you are running. It feels like I have my own personal trainer. I literally talk back to the voice sometimes lol. (You can also STILL listen to music as you run and the voice guides you). I  feel stronger with each run, I can endure more and I just love the fact that we ease into things. We don't go beast mode from day 1 because whoever created this app knows that learning to run takes time and practice and that is why the app allows you to take a break between each interval - you walk for a few minutes then jog then sprint. It's really awesome and I'm so happy I downloaded it. The first 3 workouts are free and then you have to pay.	positive
2965	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	"I‚Äôve been using RK since 2010. It was the best app ever for stats, GPS accuracy, and training plans. I‚Äôve been a paying subscriber for many years and I loved the audio couching plans, which were very serious and truly helped me prepare for races, from 5k to half marathons. Now these plans are completely gone. I tried many times to set up a ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù plan for a race, but what I get is a lousy 4-day plan (while I want to run 5-6 days), with vague instructions about comfortable, slow, long runs, etc. No variation, no audio couching anymore. Why should I pay for this miserable service that I could even find for free somewhere else? I‚Äôd rather buy a Garmin watch and listen to my music in my iPhone. 

Also, better forget about using Apple Watch, which will give you crazy stats and record zigzag runs in the map. I just don‚Äôt use the watch anymore with RK. 

So again, why should I continue to use this app, and even worse, why should I pay for it? This is extremely disappointing. I‚Äôm doing some research to find a better app with audio coaching and better training plans. It‚Äôs a shame to be basically forced out after 9 years."	negative
2966	300235330	health_and_fitness	3	Ive run with both iPhones and Samsung phones and I am realizing with their latest updates, you cannot set any training goals and use the basic free plans on iPhone without subscription but the option is still available on the Samsung phones.  Ridiculous.  Also this seems to waste my battery quite a bit.   It would be helpful to have a marathon power save feature which would help the phone to preserve energy during the long runs of 15+ miles.  And another thing, the apple watch and  iphone dont actually sync when you start from one or the other.  If You have to start from your phone because your set workout doesnt show on the watch, you have to start from both separately and hope that at the end they grab the correct stats from the phone.   Otherwise if you start your run from the phone and forget to from your watch, starting later will show current stats from the phone but when you finish you may get the stats from wherever you started from the apple watch.	positive
2967	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	I downloaded the free app because my spouse did so I figured we'd bike together and have great data to use. I ride much more frequently than her and for the first week and a half it was mediocre. Frequently pauses even though I'm not stopped causing inaccurate data although it also pauses when my ride does so auto pause seems to work. I'm sure nobody wants random pause enabled but there's no way to disable that. Somehow it calculates calories burned without any data. No matter if I bring a 50 pound trailer or have my dog pulling me or ride 3 miles or 5 miles it always says about 300 calories burned. This just can't be accurate. Now, my phone is just freezing and I'm loosing home button functionality when I try to stop the trip. Luckily I'm able to turn off my phone and that allows it to function properly again. But again that is not a fantastic feature. So basically between the random pausing, inaccurate calorie counter, and the freezing this app is trash. I can't possibly imagine someone would want to buy this. If you're considering this app and you've read this far I've heard Strava works well so I'm gonna go try that now.	positive
2968	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	Because of corona I have to run outside. I got this app to track my miles and I hate it. When your running for time you need the app to move as smoothly as possible. This kept giving me pop ups nagging me to upgrade that I had to swipe away between strides. It‚Äôs counter intuitive in design and the first time I tried it didn‚Äôt log my run at all. My next run I finished and tried to stop my clock so I could record my time. I tired to bring up the app and it went to the camera. This happened three times. I got my wife to make sure I wasn‚Äôt insane or dying of heat stroke. She said you probably have to take a photo to end the run. So I took a picture of my middle finger and sure enough the app started working again! Then I got a pop up saying the app would like to access ALL my photos!!!  what do you suppose this company is doing with your photos?! Who are they selling all that data to? That‚Äôs at best. At worst they are collecting your nudes for their own voyeuristic delight. How long before a disgruntled employee puts all those purloined photos online or a hacker gets hold of them. And all I wanted was a glorified pedometer. Just ridiculous.	positive
2969	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	Let‚Äôs just say...this app is hands down the best one out there. I have been weight lifting everyday the last 10 years (currently 24 years old) so I‚Äôm pretty fit BUT lack completely in cardio. As of this year, I decided to ramp up my cardio with a bike. Long story short - to this date I logged over 362 miles and counting since Jan 1 of 2019. One great thing this app can do is set and track goals. My goal for 2019 is 600 miles (50miles/month). The app allows you to track how much your progressing with your goals. Nike run app and others don‚Äôt even come close to this app. Another thing that‚Äôs great is you don‚Äôt need to purchase the app to use most of the functions. Even though I am now considering purchasing the yearly subscription, the free app gives you much more than what a beginner needs. Again hands down the best app and I look forward to completing my current goal and shooting even higher in 2020!	positive
2970	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	I‚Äôve tried and ran with all the major running apps - Nike+, strava, etc. while training this year for a marathon. Runkeeper would easily be my favorite if it worked correctly. Lately the total time has been showing a consistent 0:03 on the Apple Watch 2 no matter how long you‚Äôre running. Sometimes swiping the watch screen to the pause page and then back fixes this, sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. Then it will also bug out and ruin your runs. For example, on my marathon training run today, during the 19th mile (of 20) the Watch app randomly added 10 miles to my total, and started reading 29 miles. All the averages and pace changed to numbers as if I had gone that far. I thought I could fix it on the phoneme online post run, but the run never synced to the phone, despite saving it after stopping. Now the Apple activity app on my phone shows a 30 mile run with the correct total time, but it‚Äôs as if runkeeper never knew I went running. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Back to strava I guess, which doesn‚Äôt have nearly as elegant an in-run experience, but at least doesn‚Äôt crash and bug out and won‚Äôt lose my data.	negative
2971	300235330	health_and_fitness	2	So I used this app several years ago, back when I was actively running. I had a heart issue that put a halt to that, but now I‚Äôm able to start running again. I downloaded Runkeeper yesterday thinking it would be the same great app, but there‚Äôs been a lot of changes. Initially I thought the app just became a bit slicker, which is fine. But now I see you have to have a subscription for any training plan. Those used to be free, or at least some of them were. So then I thought the 5k training plan was the only free one, which I was willing to work with, but after the first few runs I notice that‚Äôs behind a subscription too! I understand the app and developers need to make money for their work, but it would‚Äôve been nice to at least have a couple training plans that were still free. I always loved Runkeeper, but I already have several subscriptions to other apps and really don‚Äôt want to have to add another. Everything is a subscription these days which is kinda annoying. I‚Äôd rather just pay a one time flat fee. Oh well. Guess I‚Äôll see what other free run apps are out there.	positive
2972	300235330	health_and_fitness	3	App does basically what it should but has some irritating, basic flaws. First, the announcing of your pace is all screwed up ‚Äì it doesn‚Äôt give you the correct pace of your last mile, or your average pace, or anything as far as I can tell. The numbers I was told during my run were completely different than the ones shown in stats after I finished. Also, the voice that tells you your stats during your run speaks WAY too slowly and enunciates every syllable in a harsh, grating way. Would be helpful if I had hearing problems but it‚Äôs annoying and unnecessary. There are issues when you ask for stats every mile ‚Äì often it announces you‚Äôve run e.g. 2.01 miles. Seriously?! And when I ran with it yesterday, it said I had run ‚Äúone miles.‚Äù This is like programming 101! Come on guys, get it together! I turned off the voice because I got sick of running a mile and hearing ‚ÄúTotal distance. One. Point. Zero. One. Miles.....Average Pace. Seven minutes. Forty two seconds. Per mile.......Total time. Seven minutes. Forty three seconds.‚Äù	negative
2973	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	I‚Äôve been using it for about 3 weeks and 9 runs.  Everything works well but I have had some glitches on occasions.  Once my activity just ended abruptly at the 7th mile of an 11 mile run. I couldn‚Äôt restart , so I had to start another activity for the rest of my run. I use an Apple Watch to control the app. Another thing that I don‚Äôt like is there is no way to revert back to a run activity if you accidentally press the end button on the watch. All you can do is Save or Discard.  It would be nice to have a cancel option so you can return it the Resume/End option screen. I‚Äôm hoping the new version released recently fixes this. I know these are my fault but it would be nice to have more options if you press the wrong button which is easy to do while running. I‚Äôve also had the notifications turnoff for no reason.  I think Runkeeper has the potential to be a five star app but for now all I can give it is four.	positive
2974	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	In general I really enjoy this app, especially the way it integrates with other apps.  I particularly enjoy being able to create my own interval run (I don‚Äôt know if this feature is only available with the paid upgrade).  Cons however are a few glitches including the notification feature- I can no longer see new notifications within the app when someone likes or comments on a workout unless I go INTO the actual workout itself, and occasionally it will opt to shuffle ALL of my music instead of playing only the playlist I selected within the app.  And every once in awhile the app will crash repeatedly when trying to save a workout, fortunately I‚Äôve never lost data- just irritating to have to go out and back in a few times to get it to finally save.  If they can smooth out those bugs then I‚Äôd be a super happy customer!	positive
2975	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	"Erin‚Äôs 5k coaching turned me into a lover of running. I have always hated running with a particular kind of psychological stuckness. I‚Äôve done multiple sprint triathlons‚Äî and WALKED the running part. Just. Couldn‚Äôt. Deal. Until Erin‚Äôs encouraging, contagious positivity snapped me out of my usual way of thinking about running! I look forward to my runs every other day and feel sad about rest days. Who am I?? Thank you Erin, thank you Runkeeper. 

Please please please add longer distance running programs with Erin. I just signed up for a half marathon in May. I‚Äôm nervous to do it without her. The best part of this app to me, is the freedom I get from my own head when I run. I just listen to what Erin tells me to think, feel, do, and believe about myself‚Äî then I do those things. There‚Äôs no space for my own self doubt or internal resistance. She is an incredible coach and brings so much value to this app. 

Thank you!"	positive
2976	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	Love this app I‚Äôve tried so many running apps before and they either froze when I opened other apps for example pandora/Spotify or Snapchat. Also they were too much , for example they either have too much information or had extra options and honestly all I wanted was to keep track of my runs/pace/time/miles/and my running tracks so basically the simple things and I found it with this ! So if your looking for a simple running app I definitely recommend this one. This app also has other options if you wish to apply them but it doesn‚Äôt force it which is good. Also you can modify your entry at the end of a run for example how you felt during the run , you can add a description and even post a picture. So yeah love this app! If that wasn‚Äôt enough it also let‚Äôs you know when you beat your time or beat the amount of miles you‚Äôve ran before.	positive
2977	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	I've used this app for many years now. It is reliable and functional. Each time I open the app, I know it will operate without fault. Every time I‚Äôve experimented with other fitness apps I‚Äôve found myself comparing them to Runkeeper and never found them comparable. As an elite member, my family appreciates the piece of mind the live tracking gives them. I run trails in remote areas and they know where I am if I need help. The interface between IOS version of RunKeeper and the Fitbit Versa 1 was spotty though. It took a long time for the Versa to connect to RunKeeper and sometimes it didn‚Äôt connect at all. I now have the Apple Watch 5 and the interface between Apple Watch and RunKeeper on IOS is exactly what I hoped for. Since the Apple Watch is a GPS device Runkeeper will run directly off the watch. The built in heart monitor is an added bonus. Keep up the good work Runkeeper.	positive
2978	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	I‚Äôve used this app for years and loved it. The last 6 months it is junk. The biggest thing is every activity I do with Apple Watch it multiplies it. It‚Äôs even adding activities to previous weeks so now I have hundreds of miles logged that I didn‚Äôt even do. That in turn is adding miles to shoe tracker and telling me I need new shoes after a few weeks. I thought maybe the app wasn‚Äôt compatible with my older iPhone 6 so I upgraded to a 10 and with no better results. Every activity I do with the phone when I go to save it the app tells me the server is slow and it can‚Äôt sync activity. Most of the time activities aren‚Äôt even showing in the feed, friends don‚Äôt get notified when I complete an activity. Now with the latest update they‚Äôve removed the connection between the watch and phone so now I can‚Äôt monitor my heart rate when cycling. Now with over 5,000 miles logged I guess I need to find a new app to use. Very disappointing! Update: before writing this review I was in contact with support numerous times and seems there was no solution. They said they were working on it.	positive
2979	300235330	health_and_fitness	3	Your app is so frustrating to use. First, you remove the feature from the home screen, which made it difficult to use when I‚Äôm doing track workouts. So once I got the Apple Watch, I thought that would resolve my complaint. But then your app kept resetting during my runs and I would lose the data. It was especially frustrating during a 16 mile run when the app reset TWICE during the same run! After that, I decided to stop using your app and use a more reliable running app. I thought I would give it a try again almost one year later and ONCE AGAIN, your app reset! I wish you would improve your app. I have had this app for almost 8 years, and it has not improved at all over this time. You are so far behind the other apps. Why don‚Äôt you have segments like Strava? It‚Äôs extremely popular. And you‚Äôre not doing anything to make it better.  I once used to pay the subscription, but it‚Äôs no longer worth it.	negative
2980	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	"I really like my fit bit Charge 2 and all of the aspects of my health that I can track with the app. 

Sometimes the app is way off on distance. On November 3 I ran 4.7 miles but it recorded 6.1 miles. On December 1, my daughter ran 3 miles and it recorded 4.7 miles. When you look at the map, you can see that the GPS is going all over the place. 

Runkeeper has a correct GPS feature, but the algorithm makes it just as far off in the other direction. One time it overstated my run by a mile and after I used the correct GPS it understated my run by a mile.

I think there are opportunities to enhance the app to provide suggestions for improving your health. It would be great if the app would track your health patterns and give you reminders for small, incremental, and achievable  changes that would have the greatest impact on a person's health. It would also be great if they could give you an overall health score, a compilation of all of the different measures. If someone isn't tracking something, like water consumption, that weight of the overall health score would get a zero. It would be even greater if the overall health score were validated relative to health outcomes such as costs absences personal perception of health, etc. Then you would be able to show a user how an incremental change in one of the items could impact overall health."	positive

________________

After this big update including the Apple Watch app I decided to go premium and wow how well designed everything working all together. Started my new training program. What I like a lot is that you start the workout from the iPhone app and then apple watch starts automatically showing me a beautifully designed screens including audio voice when to start new interval. And then all the graphs and data you can get simply gorgeous. Finally the Goal options and how it works from loosing weight to getting fitter and seeing your progress. Really excellent... And you won't get bored with all the challenges it has hidden for you."	positive
2982	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	I love Runkeeper. I had it a long time ago, stopped running, and started back up with a new email. I was able to contact customer support and actually import my old logs to my new Runkeeper account. I paid for the upgrade to Go! back in August when it was on sale and I really enjoy it. When I finish the training program I'm on now from my local running store, I'm looking forward to their training programs. I love seeing how much I have improved over time, it's extremely motivating. Even though I'm struggling now, I can see that it's because I'm going so much further and faster than I was before. The one thing I‚Äôd like to see improved is the ‚Äúthis week‚Äù and ‚Äúlast week‚Äù. I‚Äôd like to be able to choose whether my ‚Äúweek‚Äù starts on Sunday or Monday, that way I could plan my runs in my planner and they‚Äôd match up with Runkeeper.	positive
2983	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	"I‚Äôve been using Runkeeper for years. Only a short break when I couldn‚Äôt get it to play nice with my Apple Watch. Now the ‚Äúmost awesome update for watch‚Äù has occurred and I‚Äôm probably going back to MapMyRun. First, I use my watch as a remote for my phone when I‚Äôm running. I can still do that but I have to start the activity from the phone!!!  What kind of remote is that?  How am I supposed to run when I‚Äôm concentrating on putting my phone back in my belt pack?  I don‚Äôt have music on my watch so I can‚Äôt use it stand-alone. This seems like a pretty silly ‚Äúfeature‚Äù. 

Second, I used to be able to customize the display on my watch.  I like to see elapsed time, distance, current pace and average pace. Now I have no customization. I could deal with this if I had the average pace as well as current pace on there. I had to use the app to determine that the pace on the watch is the current. Sometimes that‚Äôs how I keep consistent. Although I know some people do, I could care less about my heart rate while I‚Äôm running. 

When I‚Äôm doing an interval run the watch pops up stats at the end of each interval. I‚Äôd love to shut this off because after the last interval it takes 5 or more seconds before going back to the UI so I can stop the activity. Which adds 5 or more seconds to my activity. 

Sorry folks but I think you messed this one up."	positive
2984	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	I‚Äôll be looking for a new app since this last update where they disconnected the phone & Apple Watch. I‚Äôve used this app exclusively since I started running a year ago. Loved being able to set it up on my phone with the interval cues I wanted & then see the stats on my watch. Now I can‚Äôt do that unless I start one run with the interval cues on my phone & then start a separate run on my watch to get the distance/pace/HR info. If I only run from the watch, the interval cues will just be beeps & the stats are yelled from my wrist (not through my headphones). They basically broke all of the functionality I loved & I see no difference in the tracking. Frankly, it was ridiculous to get their email this morning about ‚Äúexciting improvements‚Äù where they then listed everything they broke! I had to start two separate ‚Äúruns‚Äù this morning just to get this to work correctly! One on my phone so it would read my intervals & one on my watch so I could see the info. Removing functionality that worked perfectly well before is garbage.	positive
2985	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	This is the best running app. The woman whose voice you hear, she‚Äôs genuinely supportive, motivating, she peps you up, she keeps you focused on why you‚Äôre running and training. I‚Äôm using 5k training program to do my first ever 5K and to also max out on my quickest time for a 1.5 mile run for PT tests to get into a police academy. The app is easy to use, easy to navigate. The yearly subscription is worth it! Different running programs, great variety. I‚Äôll be doing the 10k program after I do my first 5K run. This app I‚Äôve decreased my time running in 11 seconds and I‚Äôm on week 2, and increase my incline by a lot and I‚Äôm only on week 2. Thank you for the running techniques, the tips on proper running body format, the motivation, the herring, and the info on my progress, greatest app ever. I‚Äôd hug this woman and thank her if I ever meet her who speaks on this app. Thank you! üëåüëå	positive
2986	300235330	health_and_fitness	2	"The last time I wrote a review for this app, I complained about the awful Apple Watch app and how strange it was to not embrace the top-selling fitness accessory in the world. On the same platform they are already on, too. 

A new version of the app comes out, and declares that they have a new Apple Watch app! Hope! Until I actually try to use it. The interface is admittedly better, but the stability and interruptions it causes to the running makes it completely unusable. I had to turn off my whole watch because the Runkeeper app kept closing out my run ‚Äî three times in five minutes! This without me even touching the watch or the phone.

It is frankly embarrassing to have a running app and not manage to let your users go for a run, without your software ruining the data tracking and disturbing the runner. The very reason for using the app in first place. This seems like an incredibly low bar to pass, and a scenario one would have thought you had tested. Get it together, people."	negative
2987	300235330	health_and_fitness	2	"I have been training for a marathon and upgraded to the Runkeeper Go for a year.  For the most part it has been decent but I regret paying even the half priced deal I took advantage of and won't purchase it again.  
There isn't enough functionality or stats when just using my Apple Watch, so I always bring my phone as well.  I have set up some custom workouts the night before that don't show up on my watch the next morning.  
I have also had too many times where something malfunctioned and I lost portions of my run.  Just today I was 3.6 miles into a custom workout and out of the blue runkeeper was no longer active on my watch and I heard it say it was beginning my first interval and had paused on my phone.  On my 22 mile run on Saturday when looking at the splits I see very different numbers each time I click on it.

It still works sometimes so I will probably keep using it until my year is up, but unless  I see drastic improvements I won't even consider renewing."	negative
2988	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	I‚Äôve never written a review for an app before but this update calls for one. Runkeeper absolutely ruined the app with their new update. It does not make things ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù, it makes for a terrible run tracking experience. I run with my phone and Apple Watch. I start the run using the RK app on my phone, then open the app on the watch and the summary pops up. This way I have notifications playing through my headphones, and I do not run into any syncing errors (friends have lost runs that were never synced from watch to phone). However, now they have apparently ‚Äúdecoupled‚Äù the watch and phone, so you are forced to start the run via the Apple Watch if you want to see your stats on the watch while you‚Äôre running. I also just tried starting the run on my watch to see if it worked better than I remember, and everything (pace, distance, total time) all stays at 0:00. So this app is useless. Until they add the functionality back to couple the phone and watch, I‚Äôll be using a different app. Super disappointing, I loved Runkeeper up until now.	negative
2989	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	I enjoy this app.... I would give it a five star and def recommend if they would activate the ‚ÄòSkate‚Äô activity for me to use on my Apple Watch ‚åöÔ∏è! I have to use ‚ÄòRun‚Äô or ‚ÄòBike‚Äô and it‚Äôs a nuisance to log into my PC to edit my activity to ‚ÄòSkating‚Äô. The purpose I prefer to use this app bc is the ONLY app compatible to use with Apple Watch w/o having to carry your phone...! But I have lately been using other apps and keep searching for this reason - the purpose of me splurging for this Watch was to leave my phone at home (less to carry, while skating). Before this Watch I‚Äôve been using ‚ÄòR****tic‚Äô but it doesn‚Äôt have to gps away from phone feature. All this said.... all RunKeeper has to do is to add the ‚ÄòSkate‚Äô activity on the Watch app! Seems simple enough since it already has run, walk, cycle and other..... pleaseeeeeee..... don‚Äôt make me search and learn another app... üò¢ üòè  lol	positive
2990	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	I love that it‚Äôs not hard to get started and set up a free run, I also like that you can choose to try to train for distance running, but I‚Äôm not ready for that. When I did try to see what the 5 k training was like it froze up the app even after shutting down and reopening several times. I uninstalled it and reinstalled,  now it works fine again. My one complaint was that when the app had frozen I used a different one a couple of times to track the activity and thought it was lame that I couldn‚Äôt update the same thing in this app so that all of my logs were in the same place. But I was wrong, I stumbled upon how to enter extra activities manually the other day, so really there are no legitimate complaints. Thanks for a great experience, and I love how simple and beautiful the graphics are to look at.	positive
2991	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	"I‚Äôm not a runner, but a walker working up to running.  So, I‚Äôm the average person 

I love the app over others. 

What would make it great is if the Boston Guy voice had more variations to what he says.  Not a fan of the others. 

The heart rate capture, even though synced, isn‚Äôt grabbing average heart-rate from my iwatch, which is a problem.  

It would be great if it grabbed VO2 

I wish the preset training options were varied. I know I can create my own, but I‚Äôm relying on the advice in the app.  I‚Äôm not ready for a 5k, but that‚Äôs the smallest pre-set. 

I wish it included other activities specifically, instead of ‚Äúother‚Äù, like Pilates or yoga. I haven‚Äôt tried the other option, but this app could be so inclusive and more than a ‚Äúrun keeper.‚Äù  

It would be cool if after entering parameters, like goals of intervals, high intensity, distance, etc, it could map the route in advance, so I am not left to figure it out. I understand those things can be personal so maybe that‚Äôs why it isn‚Äôt a feature. 

I love the journaling and photo capacity. It would be cool if it had video capture. 

Overall, this app has been a real motivator for my routine and is helping me develop good habits.  It would be cool if it had a nutrition component too.  

There‚Äôs a lot of competition out there, and this is a good choice. 

Keep developing it, please. üëäüèª"	positive
2992	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	The app usually works great. I use it for running and cycling, and for the most part I‚Äôm satisfied with it. The one glitch that seems to reappear is that sometimes the audio cues don‚Äôt work after I‚Äôve started a run. This is annoying if I‚Äôve already tucked my phone into my flip belt, put my gloves on, and am expecting a cue to tell me there‚Äôs an interval. Also, I‚Äôd love to be able to program in custom runs on the desktop rather than only on the iPhone, which is incredibly time consuming considering I‚Äôm doing a 20-week, six days a week custom marathon training that I need to program in.  With that said, I‚Äôd still give the app 4 stars, and I‚Äôll continue to use it. If i knew audio cues were reliable or if there were more desktop actions that could sync to my app, I would definitely buy the pro version. As it is now, I‚Äôll stick with the free one.	positive
2993	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	"Update:  I was reluctant to try out another disappointing update, but I finally did. I also didn‚Äôt want to get too excited until I tried it out a few times after the latest update, but it looks like it‚Äôs finally really working with the Apple Watch (series 3 at least).  I am relieved to be able to use this app again instead of relying on Strava with WorkoutMerge.  I‚Äôm gonna keep testing it, but things are looking up!

Previous review******************************

I tried with the Series 2 and Series 3. Runkeeper simply does not use the GPS or the altimeter properly. It does not create a map or provide a course profile unless you take your phone, which is stupid. I loved Runkeeper for years prior to this, but I refuse to run with my phone anymore. After a year and a half of frustration, I am parting ways with this app."	positive
2994	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	I came to Runkeeper after happily using MapMyFitness for a good 10 years probably, all because of a roller skating distance challenge that is going on in 2020 that requires participants to use this app for tracking.  I wish we could set our status bar by acknowledging our challenge within the app, but it only permits running, swimming, cycling, and walking challenges.  Would it be a simple fix to just add skating or ‚Äúany‚Äù to the drop down menu?  Then we can see our progress bar as we log towards 1,000 miles skates in 2020, 250 per quarter, and 20 per week.  When I tried doing the challenge as the default running, it doesn‚Äôt count my skate miles.  Otherwise, I like the better dashboard you have compared to MMF.  I will continue to run both for a while as battery holds out, but I suspect this will become my primary app soon!	positive
2995	300235330	health_and_fitness	3	I have been using Runkeeper since 2014, and have used it running in places all over the world. I‚Äôm the last few months, the apps ability to accurately track my distance and pace has degraded. I understand minor variances in distance because signal strength is never perfect, but recently my pace has been wildly off on known distance runs. I finally got on a quarter mile track this week to see how bad it was. I ran several repeats of 1 mile. Each time I finished between 7:26 and 7:30, but the app would tell me my pace was near 7:00 per mile. In one case it told me 6:50. I have no explanation because I was running in perfect weather, with no tall structures near by. I really don‚Äôt want to switch apps because I have over five years of runs stored on this app, and the app has historically been great, but distance and pace matter to me, so I‚Äôm going to start looking into other apps.	positive
2996	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	"I use this app when I‚Äôm walking my dog to measure how far we‚Äôve walked. It works great and seems to have plenty of other useful features for runners (although I don‚Äôt use them so can‚Äôt speak to their utility).

The only change I‚Äôd like to see in the app is the option to turn off the workout summary at the end. I monitor the distance we‚Äôve gone throughout our walk and have audio stats tell me this information every few minutes as well, so I don‚Äôt need the app loudly summarizing our walk for all my neighbors to hear once we‚Äôre done. The workout summary isn‚Äôt silenced when the phone is turned to silent or when I turn off audio stats. I‚Äôd like to have audio stats on and the workout summary off ideally.

This quirk aside, the app functions well for what I use it for and I would recommend!"	positive
2997	300235330	health_and_fitness	5	"I use run keeper all the time. To track my local runs and hikes.  I have been using this app for a long time.  I love the current pace and average pace.  This way if I‚Äôm running fast and have to stop and walk to recover for a little I can still monitor and keep on pace.   Also love to try to keep up with my personal best on each route.  Since I run a lot of repeat loops I can monitor and keep track of my times so I can keep up with improvements.  Love to see the tracking as well. So I can just look at my phone and quick glance see all my dates and times and treks.  Also best purchase I thin I ever
Made phone related was the Apple AirPods.  I no longer have to have a cord dangly. I have been using them for like a year and they are awesome.  Runkeeper, music and AirPods.  You will love running again."	positive
2998	300235330	health_and_fitness	2	"I run using a Series 3 Apple Watch with GPS and cell. I use the watch without a phone when I go running. I also have a run keeper go subscription and have used the app for years. I loved the app when I used it only with a phone (but I hated lugging the phone along). 

Pros
* The historical data it records is awesome. I love being able to compare what I'm doing now with what I was doing for years ago and see my rate of improvement and how it compares. 
* The workout plans seem like they would be nice, but other issues have prevented me from trying it out. 

Cons
* It doesn't start recording runs sometimes until minutes (sometimes miles) into a run. 
* It samples data points (like current position and heart rate) sporadically. I get a recorded run that looks like a caricature of where I actually ran. The heart rate data and pace data looks really un-smooth and weird. 
* It doesn't always save run data. A run I did on Sunday never got saved. I see today's run, but that one is lost.
* No summary on the watch of runs you've just completed. 
* Apple's built in workout app does all of this perfectly. It just doesn't record history Inn a useful way otherwise I'd just use that

I'd love Runkeeper if they could fix these issues, but they've been promising a fix for literally months, and there's been no sign of a fix nor updates on progress."	positive
2999	300235330	health_and_fitness	4	"20% error rate in tracking runs. Why this may matter to you: like many I‚Äôm sure, I use RunTracker as a motivational tool. Today was my last day of running in April, I was feeling good, and I thought I could meet my goal of shaving 45 seconds off my average mike time from the start of the month.  You can imagine my disappointment when I realized after the 1st mile that RunTracker had, once again, stopped tracking my run about a minute after I had started. It does this about 20% of the time, which is why I now check at my 1st mile every run to see that it is working. I feel like a better app wouldn‚Äôt require me to do this manual check. Otherwise, I do like the statistics and the rest of the features. I just wish it consistently tracked me.

As a note, I did the same run every single day in April so why it intermittently worked is beyond me."	positive
3000	300235330	health_and_fitness	1	"I loved this app up until the update this past week when the link between my iPhone and Apple Watch was severed. I have yet to find how to make any of the interval prompts/audio stats go to my headphones.  If this feature was going to be added it should be something you can toggle on or off and how it was left out for other performance updates escapes me.  Hugely disappointed because I had paid for the update to premium not too long ago and this app is now completely useless to me.  I‚Äôll be switching to a different app and encouraging others to do the same.  This sort of feature drop is not acceptable for user loyalty.

Adding the following after reading the developer response for similar reviews:  You either have bad product managers, bad developers or both.  I work in the software industry in Product and never would we ever pull long standing functionality without clear stats it was not used nor would our engineers especially with an undefined timeline for replacement."	negative
3001	756972930	education	5	FlipGrid has been a game-changer. This app combines everything kids like: making videos, social media type format (but safe), it gives a voice to EVERYONE. If you are worried that it will be too scary for your shy/quiet kids....don‚Äôt. Students can draw a picture, show a picture while saying what they know. It allows re-dos, emojis, and selfies!! Teachers can control the time....so you get a quick, formative or summative assessment of what they know. I have used it in so many ways....students record their learning, show a video of what they made (example: show rollercoasters they made to demonstrate potential and kinetic energy). I have also used it with my PLN on Twitter with fellow educators and getting to know each other. Lastly, I have been recording myself before each quiz and I give a 3 Minute Flip of everything they need to know - so much great feedback on that. Oh.....and AR, we have used that too. FlipGrid is also SUPER responsive on Twitter. Such a great app and company.	positive
3002	756972930	education	5	Flipgrid is one of my favorite tools to recommend to other teachers. It is an all-around great tool, providing for differentiation, student voice, engagement, peer feedback, and saving time. It is made for students to quickly and easily join and record their videos. This is a game changer in the classroom, especially for those students who hate to write.  They can discuss, share ideas, provide proofs, and explain. Then, they have fun ways to dress up their videos with stickers and filters. For those students that are even more self-conscious, they can use the white board instead of recording their own face. It is easy for teachers to use, too. They have their own login to manage their grids that make it easy to respond to the students. If you have a problem, the people supporting this app are so helpful. They really do want it to work well for you. Just look at all the great reviews they have gotten.	positive
3003	756972930	education	5	"Flipgrid is my favorite educational tool! My students use the web version because we they have Chromebooks at school, but I use the app on my iPhone the majority of the time. I am able to do almost everything I need from the app wherever I am. The only feature I cannot use yet is creating Shorts videos but I prefer to do those from my computer anyway.

I use the app to create assignments, spark discussions, to make sub plans, and to reply and provide my students with their feedback. The camera is intuitive and easy to use and I can access everything I need. My kindergarten daughter is able to use it as well without much support. 

The Flipgrid team is always enhancing newer versions and additions as their users provide ideas and feedback, so it is constantly improving with frequent updates. It‚Äôs a favorite for me as a teacher and my students are highly engaged every time we use it!"	positive
3004	756972930	education	4	I absolutely love the video editing and how easy it is to trim individual videos and move them around. I have encountered a few problems with this app though. The loading takes LITERALLY FOREVER. I‚Äôve tried some different things to help out with it but none seem to work. It‚Äôs weird, all of my other apps work with my WiFi so it‚Äôs not that... another problem I encountered is this: when I‚Äôm editing videos sometimes the app glitches and begins playing the audio from several different parts of what I recorded. It‚Äôs trippy. When this happens I have to close out of the app and go back on, which then it thankfully saves my progress and I can continue to make edits to my video. Not end of the world, but definitely annoying at times. Overall, it‚Äôs a really fun app and I love the ability to Connect with peers and classmates, I love using Flipgrid! That‚Äôs all :) thanks!!!	positive
3005	756972930	education	1	Riddle me this, I just put hours into a video I had to shoot for a class and when I go to edit all the segments to perfect them, it decides not to load them up, I was literally looking at a black screen. I tried pausing and unpausing the video, and it wouldn‚Äôt load up, I tried watching each piece by itself and it still wouldn‚Äôt load up. Heck, just to confirm it wasn‚Äôt on my end I switched from WiFi to LTE - still nothing. Then within moments it‚Äôs just gone, the entirety of my video gone. Are you kidding me? Hours of work down the drain because this app couldn‚Äôt function like it‚Äôs supposed to. Also, I was within my time limit too! The teacher gave us up to 10 minutes for this video and I was at 8:34! There is no excuse for this. This app does not function like it should. Very poor user interface. Hey kids, if your teachers are wanting you to use this app for any school related thing, do everything in your power to get them to not. Worst app out there for video assignments. One star rating if that.	positive
3006	756972930	education	2	I feel like most people reviewing this app are teachers, who say they love it, not their students.  As a student, i‚Äôm not a huge fan of this app, i would much rather right things down on do online classes because having to take videos of yourself then posting them for all of your classmates to see is not amazing. Theres also the problem of video quality, everyone has a different camera or different things they use and sometimes that makes it hard to understand other people‚Äôs videos so they don‚Äôt get as good a grade for something they can‚Äôt control. I am using this app for spanish class, and i understand why. It‚Äôs so we can learn to speak spanish, but we aren‚Äôt. We can pause the video at anytime. Just memorizing a script, not learning, unlike with zoom classes. So while teachers may like this app, many students do not as they aren‚Äôt learning with it. And it just adds extra pressure and more things for them to do.	positive
3007	756972930	education	5	"Flipgrid is super engaging for my students. They love the opportunity to share their thoughts via video, add emojis or annotations, then share with others. Even students who were reluctant recorders at first have developed confidence in sharing their voice with others. 

As a teacher, I find it valuable to hear directly from my students voice rather than read a paper. Fluency, inflection and tone offer deeper insight into what. Y students are thinking Nd their depth of knowledge. 

We use flip QR code‚Äôs to get into the app, as well as share videos with others in the school. Since I can use whichever features I want and adapt my expectations for different lessons and classes, I am able to use this app with every grade level at my school from k-4. My kindergarteners have even become experts."	positive
3008	756972930	education	5	So I work with KG students in China. It is often difficult to get students to engage because they are concerned with how they sound when they speak. When I introduced Flipgrid as a way we can just talk to each other during the Covid-19 quarantine, my students just loved that they could communicate with each other through video and chat about whatever was in their minds. Every morning I walk my dog and set up a new question for the kids to answer. It could be about anything! The weather, my doggy, what I should have for breakfast, what they will have for dinner, their favorite shows... anything... and they get to talking. And the grid is so easy to access and set up videos that it‚Äôs simple for them to do once parents have shown them. Great job Flipgrid!	positive
3009	756972930	education	5	Flipgrid is a fantastic tool for giving every student a voice. Whether it is checking for understanding, discussing a topic, or any other number of instructional strategies, it is always challenging to hear from every student. Flipgrid captures each student‚Äôs understanding, reasoning, comment, etc. and creates a forum for further dialog. Along the way, it provides an opportunity to build digital citizenship skills. Yes, I left out that it all happens by recording videos and that‚Äôs on purpose. It‚Äôs not about the videos, yes that‚Äôs the medium, but it‚Äôs really about capturing the learning of every student. To top it off, it‚Äôs easy for teachers and there are tons of resources and guides. Making this happen with any other tool or platform would fall short and be so much more work. Try Flipgrid, it‚Äôs flipping awesome!	positive
3010	756972930	education	5	Are you looking for a technology piece that will truly be a game changer? Look no further, FLipgrid is THAT piece.  This easy to use app allows students the opportunity to write, record, and collaborate their views with whomever you, the instructor, allows. This app is truly for all ages! The educator sets how you want their recording shared which covers every privacy concern there is. Only you can see it, just your class, your school, or students around the world! It‚Äôs simple accessibility allows all digital learners to be successful. I can‚Äôt recommend this app enough. I use this for students to read in and I can keep track of fluency. I can respond to individual students and hold actual conversations. Book reviews are a breeze.  Love, love, LOVE this app! Download it! Thank me later!	positive
3011	756972930	education	4	I‚Äôve only been using Flipgrid for a few days, but I think it‚Äôs an excellent platform with many fantastic features and simple user interface. The one thing I wish it would let me do that it doesn‚Äôt...yet...hint, hint to the developers...is to provide video feedback easily to individual students with videos that are moderated/hidden. As a Choir teacher, I know that many of my students will be reluctant to share videos with their peers, but they would be willing to share videos with me...that part is easy. However, when it comes to me giving them video feedback, it‚Äôs not so simple...they can‚Äôt see it. Please fix this by giving teachers the option of allowing the student who posted the video to view video feedback from their teacher. Thank you for this great platform!	positive
3012	756972930	education	5	"Fall 2019- My middle school students were very excited about using this app. It was easy to create a class ‚Äúgrid‚Äù and assignment, sign up my students for the first time, have them post their first video, and view classmates‚Äô videos all within one period!

Spring 2020 (update) - This app has truly enhanced student engagement with our science content, the development of our classroom community, and the growth of students‚Äô communication skills across different media! We have also found fun uses for it such as having students complete self-reflections to share with their families. Flipgrid‚Äôs social media is excellent because they interact with many teachers who share creative tips and innovative ways to use the program."	positive
3013	756972930	education	5	Flipgrid has become my go to in my ‚Äúcrisis schooling‚Äù escapades. For a LA classroom, it is a super creative way for students to answer questions for a reading comprehension passage or show me their how to do something. I‚Äôve been able to week by week, increase the difficulty of their assignments - week one, log in; week 2, tell me the name of your book report book; week 3, answer questions from a podcast I assigned; week 4, do a how to/procedural writing and show me your activity (making eggs, a paper airplane, etc); week 5, presenting your book report. If I hadn‚Äôt found Flipgrid I‚Äôd still be grading boring stuff - Flipgrid has allowed my class to become more creative & hands on, even in a time of staying home and doing nothing!	positive
3014	756972930	education	5	"Flipgrid is the one activity in my 3rd grade class that ALL the students love. Some students were a little apprehensive at first, especially the quiet ones. When they realized they could make the video by themselves, and re-do it as many times as needed, it was a game-changer. 
     Teachers have the ability to limit the length of the videos. I think that levels the playing field when Flipgrid is used for presentations. Students learn quickly how to focus on the important information while also showing some of their personality. 
     I also love that the people at Flipgrid are always updating/improving the app. Having augmented reality QR  codes posted on my hallway bulletin board has made it both fun and interactive"	positive
3015	756972930	education	5	There are a lot of apps out there for education but none of them are like a family. Education has üíö and this is the only app that I have found that has that! Not too mention, the app itself is PHENOMENAL!!! By using video, you can truly see students in their thought processes. They can create examples to showcase their knowledge. You can make connections beyond your classroom and provide opportunities for every student to be heard. But it‚Äôs so much more than that! You can connect with a community of invested inspiring educators and celebrate each other‚Äôs successes! I absolutely couldn‚Äôt go back to teaching without it. It‚Äôs a MUST HAVE! You must have this!! It‚Äôs FREE!! Go hit that download button and start amplifying STUDENT VOICE!! #FlipgridFever	positive
3016	756972930	education	5	This past Friday, my students and I presented about our #FlipgridFever at our regional STEM conference. My students and fellow staff members all love how collaborative Flipgrid is. They‚Äôre able to share and reply to each other‚Äôs responses. Teachers are able to incorporate this app for all kinds of uses‚Äîvocabulary, book clubs, mentoring, etc. One is only limited by their own creativity! With the newest release of the app, I am loving the AR feature and am planning to create my first AR bulletin board in the coming weeks. My students also appreciate all the new customizable features that allow them to express their creativity in unique ways. Flipgrid is a great way to have all of your students share what they know! And best of all, it‚Äôs FREE!	positive
3017	756972930	education	5	FLIPGRID has allowed my students to build confidence and relationships in and out of the classroom. Originally I started using Flipgrid as a form of assessing what students knew. Now I have learned so many ways to utilize this video app in my classroom. This app has completely exceeded my expectations. The staff at Fligrid make using this app feel like you have a community supporting you every step of the way. When I needed help with Flipgrid, the response from support staff was punctual and knowledgable. This app has helped to increase student engagement, access prior knowledge, make connections and build a sense of community in my classroom/school. Students are able to teach/ learn from each other and share their voice in a creative way with confidence.	positive
3018	756972930	education	1	Hello, I am a student. As you can see there are reviews from teachers which say their students love to use Flipgrid. As I said earlier I am a student. I know for a fact that me and many other students from my school hate using Flipgrid. This app forces us to horrifying videos of ourselves talking about something we don‚Äôt care about. When you make your video other students will use your video as blackmail. If this is not the case will make fun of you. I have seen my teachers grading flip grid and it takes longer than most things they would have to grade. Teachers have to constantly pause the video which the student has recorded and sometimes the quality of the video is hard for the teacher to understand. I use this app for English classes and the videos restrain students from learning how to write in a way that they are able to write as if they were speaking. Thank you for reading my honest feedback as a studentüôÇ	positive
3019	756972930	education	5	Not only is this app awesome, but the people behind the app are awesome too. They always listen to update ideas and ways to improve their app to better accommodate student learning and make things easier for educators. Flipgrid helps my students share their voice in an easy, non threatening way. The recent update has made it even sooo much better! Students love it and I love seeing them and hearing their ideas. It‚Äôs fun, simple, and a great way to encourage students who may not want to share their ideas aloud in class. It‚Äôs also super great for my student who are online. We build community by using these videos! There‚Äôs nothing easier to use than Flipgrid. Just press the plus sign and go!	positive
3020	756972930	education	4	During this time of distance learning, I have integrated Flipgrid with my elementary Google Classrooms. Many students/parents were having a hard time attaching videos to assignments, so I wanted to make it easier for them to record responses (that takes up less storage on their phones!). It has been a fun and useful tool to connect with my students while we‚Äôre all at home. I appreciate the ability to moderate posts, though, I wish there was a setting where all of MY responses were automatically ‚Äúactivated,‚Äù because it does take a long time to manually activate each my videos in addition to the students my videos. I‚Äôm the music teacher, so I have the entire school (about 300 students) in my classes!	positive
3021	756972930	education	5	As a Spanish teacher, you need ways to encourage students to speak. Flipgrid is a great way to get them talking. It is very easy to access for them  and allows the flexibility to record in app as well as upload clips that have been recorded previously. It is easy to create and manage topics and submissions right on your phone, tablet or laptop. As an  IPhone app it is very easy to use. It remembers your recent grids to give you a shortcut. I can seamlessly view as a student or login to my educator dashboard.  You can easily scan or enter Flipgrid codes. There are so many useful features in the app you don‚Äôt have to use a desktop or laptop to use the program.  I love it.	positive
3022	756972930	education	5	All I have to do is say the word Flipgrid and my students cheer and listen!  This app allows my learners to share their their voice in an authentic way. First of all, it‚Äôs the way they love to learn! Secondly, it encourages speaking and listening soft skills that my students so desperately need. It‚Äôs GREAT for my ELL learners too. They can learn from their peers by listening to their videos and they hear themselves as they practice proper speech.  It allows me to differentiate assessments and give instant feedback. But the reason I truly love Flipgrid is because helping me build stronger relationships with my students... the loud ones that always want to share and the quiet ones I rarely hear from! My teacher heart is happy!	positive
3023	756972930	education	5	I‚Äôm a technology teacher and I‚Äôve been introducing Flipgrid to my teachers and students this past school year. I have had an overwhelmingly positive response from both teachers and students. Teachers are loving it because it allows them offer multiple means of presentation for their students. Students are loving it because they have another option to show what they know besides a slideshow, paper, or poster. One suggestion - sometimes students need a little quiet to record videos, so let them sit in the hallway if you can or in quiet corners of the room to record! Can‚Äôt wait to use it even more the rest of the year as we prepare for Spring Exhibit Night!	positive
3024	756972930	education	4	As a performing arts teacher, I struggle with engagement during rehearsal periods. Are the students truly rehearsing their monologues, scenes or pantomimes? Even though I had check ins with my students, I did not have data to support their claims: ‚ÄúOf course I‚Äôm rehearsing.‚Äù Flipgrid offers tangible evidence that the standards are indeed being worked on. On Flipgrid, I designed 1st looks for a performance enabling the student to perform with low risks: they are at home or in a comfortable environment, not in front of a live audience,  and it‚Äôs not the final performance assessment. Flipgrid allows me and other students to critique work in a positive manner. The rubric features ensures objectivity, and the video response offers personal commentary. My Students live Flipgrid and so do I.	positive
3025	756972930	education	5	"I am an avid user of Flipgrid with my students. The power of this app is endless depending on how you choose to use it with your students. 
The app is simple to use and makes recording anywhere possible! 
The recent updates released in August of 2019 for the new school year are incredible. The number of integrations that all more students opportunities to share their thinking is practically infinite. 
The developers of this app are always listening to user feedback! Adding new features and improving the overall functionality of the is a constant from team Flipgrid. 
Thank you for helping me to amplify student voice in and out of the classroom."	positive
3026	756972930	education	5	One of the best things about being a educator is getting to put ‚ù§Ô∏è into the work we do every day. Flipgrid gets it and has built a fabulous tool to engage students and teachers in the love of learning. This is a user-friendly app that really capitalizes on the relationships we build with our students and colleagues. It is extremely community oriented and is great for building confidence and communication skills through collaboration and community building. I have yet to find a better tech tool for helping my students creatively and safely share their voices to teach and learn from each other. The Flipgrid network of educators invested in inspiring and celebrating other educators is amazing! Love it!	positive
3027	756972930	education	5	Flipgrid has been the app I‚Äôve used most for fostering community and student engagement. Especially unique is the huge amount of support online from the Flipgrid team and community. Soooo many innovative ideas! Constant opportunities to train and to develop your skills, or to learn to app smash with your other favorite apps. Easy to master the basics, then the community will help you connect and learn even more. They are responsive to teachers‚Äô needs and are adding great features all the time: Screencasting, digital whiteboards, lessons in the Disco library. And it is completely free. No hidden levels of membership. Microsoft supports teachers and learners with this gift!	positive
3028	756972930	education	5	"I teach middle school students who struggle to respond to what they read.  A lot of them have great ideas but to write it out in an essay would take them more time to process.  

Flipgrid allows my students who struggle with writing to respond with those ideas without having to spell or do sentence formation.  They have a voice and they are engaged!  They enjoy the selfie option at the end with the sticker enhancements.  They love watching each other‚Äôs videos.  They like that they can redo them as many times as they need to get it right (which they can‚Äôt do in an oral presentation).  

This has been a staple in my classroom for a while now and it is a great tool!"	positive
3029	756972930	education	5	Flipgrid is being used constantly in my classroom! I teach 4th grade, and I have used the app in every single subject that I teach. We use it to brainstorm ideas for writing, share our problem solving process in math, explain scientific reasoning in science, act out various historical events,  practice our fluency in reading, plus so much more! I have loved the new addition of the AR feature, as it has allowed students to express their creativity and improve their communication skills. I have also used it to film instructions for stations, leave example explanations for homework, and videos to leave for subs when I‚Äôm out. I can‚Äôt imagine life without Flipgrid!!	positive
3030	756972930	education	5	"I have been using Flipgrid in my classroom for a few years now and this company continues to amaze me!  They constantly listen to teachers and what they would find useful with their app and makes it a reality for them. New features are being added or improved upon!! 
This has truly transformed my teaching!  My students are more engaged and motivated in my lessons which I use Flipgrid.  It is so easy for me to implement a quick activity on the fly!  This is such a great tool for long term assessments, showing growth over time, collaboration globally and locally, connecting with parents and community members, and so so much more! I would give this 1000üåüif I could!!"	positive
3031	756972930	education	5	I had downloaded the app and set up my account last summer, with the full intentions of using it this school year. Right before school started we got hit with a new reading program that took so much time that we haven‚Äôt been able to do anything fun. Flash forward to now and the schools being shut down and the students learning from home. I introduced my 8th graders to Flipgrid this week and it is giving us a fun engaging way to communicate as we do distance learning. It has done this teacher‚Äôs heart so much good to be able to see and hear from my students after weeks of not seeing them. Thank you Flipgrid!	positive
3032	756972930	education	5	Edtech comes and goes. And more often than not, it goes...goes away! But Flipgrid is so much more than a tool in the overcrowded edtech space. It‚Äôs a communication tool. It‚Äôs a connection tool. It‚Äôs an empowerment tool. Students can communicate and connect with each other. Students can communicate and connect with teachers. Students can communicate and connect with a global audience all through the simple steps presented in Flipgrid. Reply via audio and video to a prompt, a question, a concern. Keep connections private or public. You, the teacher, decide. If you haven‚Äôt given Flipgrid a spin, do so now. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Plus, it‚Äôs FREE!	positive
3033	756972930	education	5	This app and online tool has been the platform to empower my students and completely change the dynamic of my classroom! It has quickly become a favorite of mine! It‚Äôs an awesome tool to use in so many ways!!! Students can show content mastery, express themselves creatively, encourage one another, and support learning for themselves and others along the way! Families are even more connected to their child‚Äôs learning now thanks to Flipgrid! I have also had the pleasure of teaching many colleagues about this tool! Many have ignited learning in their own classrooms as well because of Flipgrid! Thank you so much for all you‚Äôre doing!	positive
3034	756972930	education	5	Flipgrid is an AMAZING platform that is particularly user friendly... especially with younger students! It creates opportunities for students to share their learning in an engaging way! I love that Flipgrid continues to update its platform by making it even more engaging! There are so many fantastic integrations with other apps/platforms as well! It is also a great way to integrate those speaking and listening standards that tend to get overlooked! As a digital integration specialist delivering district PD to teachers, the response from educators regarding the platform has been astoundingly positive! Many teachers leave the trainings excited and anxious to integrate this tool in their classroom!	positive
3035	756972930	education	5	I recently joined the Flipgrid Movement and the only regret I have is, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I start this sooner?!‚Äù My students are loving Flipgrid!!! It‚Äôs an amazing tool that can easily be incorporated in any classroom. It‚Äôs very user friendly and easy to set up in case you aren‚Äôt tech savvy!  Once students get started on a grid, they wont want to stop! My Flipgrid ‚Äúexperts‚Äù have shared their thoughts through book talks and responses to important topics discussed in class; we recently collaborated with other classrooms at our campus, too!!! I‚Äôve enjoyed seeing my students feel confident and excited to record themselves and share their thoughts and collaborate with their peers.	positive
3036	756972930	education	5	"I‚Äôve loved using Flipgrid in both my English and history classes as a way of providing quality peer review experiences. Talking with peers or filling out a lengthy peer review checklist can be daunting. With Flipgrid, my students can curate their comments and customize their response in ways that were previously impossible in traditionally formatted class discussion.

Recently, we again turned to Flipgrid to post quick research findings in the form of broadcasts. Even my most reluctant students loved the chance to talk, edit, and synthesize their information about the Cuban sugar trade in real time.

So grateful for this tool and its promotion of friendly, focused feedback."	positive

3038	756972930	education	5	I am a college music teacher and have been using flipgrid for a few weeks now since our classes have gone online. I have been tremendously impressed by how flipgrid strikes a balance between being feature rich and user friendly. My students like that it is simple to use and it makes asynchronous learning user-friendly. There is a great community of users that have excellent tips and ideas for how to deliver content and use the platform. Flipgrid also links to Canvas which is the LMS we have at my university. I would highly recommend this product.	positive
3039	756972930	education	3	I‚Äôm really self conscious about my appearance so having my teachers force me to use this app was hell. Not only that, but the one time I actually used it, I lost all of the footage because the delete button was inconveniently placed. Fourth five minutes of film for a group project. Gone. We managed to finish it the next class, but I still don‚Äôt like the app. However, if the app is used for non educational reasons, it‚Äôs hella fun. Even when we were filming for our project, we had fun acting and putting on voices. Granted it isn‚Äôt necessarily a positive about the app and more about how you use it, I think that the app is good for some people. But personally, I don‚Äôt like it. I do recommend it for people who are comfortable with their faces on video though!	positive
3040	756972930	education	5	I was introduced to Flipgrid during tech training in my district this year. I kept coming back to ‚Äòhow could this be used with my students who have significant learning challenges.‚Äô Then COVID19 happened and schools were closed. I have been using it as a tool to have parents take videos of their student doing something at home. It has been more awesome than I could have imagined and such a wonderful way to stay connected with families and for peers and therapists to see what the students are doing. Once this outbreak is finished, there will be new ways for me to use Flipgrid with students. I‚Äôm hooked!	positive
3041	756972930	education	5	"I‚Äôve been using Flipgrid in my music classes this year and it has been a game-changer. I started by having third grade students perform playing tests on their recorders and they love it! It gives me more time in the classroom to work with struggling students and it keeps students engaged both inside and outside of the classroom.  I have incorporated Flipgrid with my band students as well, and I have seen the amount of time that they are practicing at home increase to get the ‚Äúperfect take.‚Äù 

Now that we are teaching remotely, Flipgrid has been a great way to keep in touch with my students and have them communicate with me."	positive
3042	756972930	education	5	FlipGrid has changed the way I assess speaking entirely! Before, students used to dread having to sit face-to-face with me and I always noticed that they were extremely nervous. FlipGrid has given them the platform to not only speak in a setting that makes them more comfortable, but allows them to express themselves and fuse aspects of social media with education. I love that my quiet students are able to be heard and given feedback immediately, I love when they include things from their house in their videos, and I love when they ask me if I liked their selfie at the end of the clip. This program is truly wonderful.	positive
3043	756972930	education	5	I have used Flipgrid in three of my classes, and it has worked well both on computer and phone. Personally I prefer it to live presentations, because we (students) can pause to switch speakers or redo the video entirely if we mess up, and you can view other people‚Äôs videos whenever and however many times you want. It has also been a good platform for distance learning since our school has had to close temporarily due to the virus. With Flipgrid our teachers are able to easily see videos we submit since we can‚Äôt have in-person interactions.	positive
3044	756972930	education	1	I have to record a video through flipgrid for Spanish class and I used multiple clips by starting and stopping the video. Near the end of my video, my screen was black and my clips disappeared. There was no way out of this screen without losing all of my footage so I lost all of my footage. I just decided to reshoot everything and I didn‚Äôt think it would happen again. But, of course, at the very end when I finished the last shot, I got a black screen. The submit button was on the screen though and I tried to submit the video but now when I checked the app again my video didn‚Äôt show up and now I have to reshoot again but I‚Äôm out of time for today. This bug should be fixed immediately as I wasted an hour of my time where now have to reshoot on a busier night than I was hoping for.	negative
3045	756972930	education	5	As an ELA/ESL teacher, I cannot recommend another tool for building confidence in the classroom. With Flipgrid, students feel empowered to share their ideas, concerns and understanding. Students understand that their voice is heard and above all, valued. Flipgrid has allowed my most reluctant English learner to speak up in front of his peers. With the many features that Flipgrid offers, it has become the go-to tool in my classroom. It is easy to appsmash with other apps and the fact that I can add copilots makes this a great tool to collaborate and to monitor student progress. Flipgrid doesn‚Äôt only empower students, but teachers as well!	positive
3046	756972930	education	5	As a middle school theatre teacher I often need to see that my students can perform a skill, but don‚Äôt always have the time or desire to devote a full class day to individual performances before they‚Äôre ready for the unit‚Äôs final assessment. Flipgrid allows me to formatively assess my students‚Äô abilities while letting them be the creators of their own content. My students are always excited to use Flipgrid in our classroom, and love watching their own videos as well as others‚Äô. Flipgrid is easy for students to access and use, and supports a collaborative, innovative, and creative classroom.	positive
3047	756972930	education	5	I love Flipgrid and all the skills that it helps students to build in correlation with the standards I am already teaching! It is so important that we continue to allow time for students to develop their verbal communication skills, practice poise and tone, all while communicating in creative ways. Students can communicate and learn with some one in the room, down the hall, across the county or even across the world! Flipgrid is the paper towel of education! It soaks up all the possibilities and it continues to grow each day. I use it for everything and can‚Äôt believe I ever taught without it!	positive
3048	756972930	education	5	Flipgrid is such a great tool to use within the classroom! There are so many uses for such a variety of things - formative assessments, review, book talks, parent teacher conferences, students teaching other students (or adults) - the ideas are truly endless! The app is also really user friendly, so there isn‚Äôt much of a learning curve when you‚Äôre getting started. I highly recommend this app to anyone who is looking to bring in a new way or teaching, anyone looking for a new way to spice up their teaching or just anyone who likes to bring engaging teaching tools into the classroom!	positive
3049	756972930	education	5	I teach elementary - library. Students use Flipgrid most often to do book reviews. They build their communication skills when they are creating. They love watching each other‚Äôs to get new book ideas. When they return a book, I ask, ‚ÄúDid you like it? Then do a Flipgrid review!‚Äù We watch the best via mixtape feature in class and give feedback, always improving. Flipgrid is always adding new features based on teacher feedback. They are a part of the larger Ed community on Twitter, at conferences etc. It feels like an app you can trust and will be around.	positive
3050	756972930	education	5	Flipgrid has changed the way students respond to prompts. Instead of writing all the time, students are able to submit their responses in a new and different way. The updates are also revolutionizing. The different filters and stickers allow the students that don‚Äôt like speaking in front of others the opportunity to disguise their faces. This is not only great for use with students but also with staff development and reflection as well as allowing parents to interact with their children in completely different media that is simple to learn and use.	positive
3051	469863705	education	5	What an incredible app. I‚Äôm so impressed. This company deserves loads of money to be thrown at it for making it free. My son has just switched from a Cambridge school to an American School and missed a lot of work. I think we were both about to give up. I didn‚Äôt know where to start to help him and being his new school is completely iPad based we felt deep despair at just the thought of trying to navigate through classrooms codes and half working text book apps. Now it‚Äôs all here in one place! Simple well explained and the practice really gets your confidence going. He had some maths homework and instead of the total melt down we both would have had trying to work out what was going on we flew through it!! THANK YOU! I love the fact that all the grades are here too so if there is a concept he is struggling with we can go back in the grades to see where that was introduced and work through it! We have been struggling for months trying to find the answer on line. It was only due to the fact that Khan kept coming up that I googled it and found the app. I truly pray this company gets loads of financial support to keep this app going! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!	positive
3052	469863705	education	1	I had used this app in the past for math and it was great for that. The history lessons, however, are atrocious. Rather than objectively presenting the facts, it gives a warped view of things. For example, the authors have somehow figured out how people ‚Äòfelt‚Äô during history. No citations. No quotes. They just claim that this person/group felt this, that person/group felt that. I find the personal feelings of past figures to be secondary to learning the course of events. But, if they did feel some need to include them, they could at least cite sources or provide quotes. I saw none. It turned what could‚Äôve been a factual history lesson into some subjective mind-reading of the past. All it was really instructing me on was someone‚Äôs opinion of what people in the past felt. It wasn‚Äôt educational. Not only is there a bias of perspective ‚Äî today‚Äôs opinion of the past may differ greatly from how people in the past actually experienced it. Opinion and feeling are not the point. It‚Äôs history, not group therapy. As I said, if you want to include feelings, at least use quotes, cite sources. But, again, that really isn‚Äôt the point. History is not about the feelings of one person or even a group of people, it‚Äôs about objective events. Sadly, there was so little of that here, I just deleted the app. What a sad thing education has become!	negative
3053	469863705	education	5	"Pretty good app. I am giving it five stars, even though a recent update put everything in deeper layers. I used to be able to see every video, article, and practice exercise for a course, plus its mission if it has one, on the same screen. Now I have to dig deeper. Please return an expanded view to us! Also, we no longer see our consecutive days streak.

The iPad app is missing a few things found in the web version, in addition to the consecutive days streak, but it is quite adequate for the learning experience.

The most maddening thing is that when you roll out a new version with a major change like this, you still say ‚ÄúBug fixes and performance enhancements.‚Äù Please give this review a Developer Response and let us know that you will {in the future/in future} be detailed with your updates when something major like the whole interface changes. Also, please let us know why the consecutive days counter (more motivating to me than energy points and about as motivating as the badges) was removed and if there‚Äôs a chance we can get it back. Thanks!"	positive
3054	469863705	education	5	"I love the new layout and of course I love Kahn academy. Which is why I gave it three stars. But I‚Äôve gone through course reviews and challenges and keep having to redo because there‚Äôs an error saving an exercise. I just tried taking the course challenge and got through all the problems but the last I got an error. So I re-entered the challenge only to find that the progress I‚Äôd made on the 29 problems up to the last had also disappeared and I was being required to take the entire challenge of 30 problems over again. As I‚Äôd already spent my allotted time for Kahn for the day, I‚Äôll have to come back tomorrow and start again. To be sure this is just a review course for me so in the grand scheme of things I could proceed to the more advanced course without problem, but I just so like seeing that 100% on every course.

UPDATE: after the latest update, I‚Äôve gotten through challenges and practice without an app error and my progress is saved, so as of now, anyway, I‚Äôm quite pleased with the app."	positive
3055	469863705	education	5	Okay this app is beyond amazing and helpful! I been using this program since I was eight years old to now. I‚Äôm certainly fourteen and this program is best to use when I‚Äôm having trouble. I‚Äôve made an account about a year ago because I did not have a official yet. I been using it for a short period because I only used it when given an assignment or when my teachers weren‚Äôt making any sense. Point is when I found out there was an app I was very excited because now I get to use it to my advantage. Since the Corona virus is spreading it has been putting my school on a stay home. My teachers have to relay on me doing the school work at home having to learn, study, and prepare for my Exams at home. And having to catch up by myself and not getting behind online and dealing with what‚Äôs going on right now is going to be stressful. But knowing I have this app will save lots of time thank you plan on using this until I‚Äôm in college!	positive
3056	469863705	education	5	This app has helped me so much in college when I didn‚Äôt understand concepts and formulas. I don‚Äôt know why people are complaining about not seeing their progress on this app or that it lacks in depth because Khan Academy isn‚Äôt supposed to be a replacement for a class. He goes over the basics of whatever subject you‚Äôre researching because you can‚Äôt do advanced material without learning the basics first. Also, progress is in the mind and you shouldn‚Äôt have to rely on an app to tell you that. In college, professors don‚Äôt have the time to do one-on-one sessions with students and quickly go through a whole year of subjects separated into segments in five months on specific days. I sometimes can‚Äôt keep up so I use Khan Academy after homework hours to look up sections/concepts I missed or couldn‚Äôt understand in very little time to teach my myself the missing components. Thank you Khan Academy for making my academic life easier.	positive
3057	469863705	education	4	I think there‚Äôs so much stuff and challenges and quizzes and videos to help, but it gets really confusing sometimes when there‚Äôs so much information thrown at you. In the assignments tab I think you should add important key features, viewing the assignments from due earlier to due later, viewing assignments from highest level like 88% on a practice to 100% on a practice and separating them from videos and practices and everything else. It‚Äôs really a pain to scroll all the way to the bottom to see my assignments I didn‚Äôt complete since my teachers assign a LOT and I mean A LOT of homework on your app. I decided to rate your app fairly and not biased on we‚Äôre I like math or not, but rather the methods to teach and learn math. So there are some highlights. I like that you get hints for every single practice and it must be hard to make all of the detailed word problems. I also like that you can look back into the questions you messed up and learn from those questions.	positive
3058	469863705	education	1	"Khan Academy used to be good when the whole system wasn‚Äôt broken. Everything is overcomplicated, and requires you to waste hours on what can only be defined as guesswork.
The way you MUST type in math answers exactly right with no forgiveness is absolutely disgusting, especially when the whole point is taken off. Is one typo really a reason to drop the grade down a whole point? Especially when my Teacher grades this on a 1-4 scale. One wrong answer drops the grade to a 75%. Ridiculous.
The fact that using a hint or watching a video takes off the whole point is also completely unjust. Please consider making the system more tailored to learning through visual processing and not repetition and failure.
I hope that this system is fixed and makes it more about learning than catering towards students who already have mastered the material. This is not practice if the student does not already know the material.
As a student who has a teacher who relies solely on Khan Academy to teach, I feel absolutely frustrated when spending hours upon hours attempting to beat the system."	negative
3059	469863705	education	4	"First of all thank you Mr. Kahn! Much love and many blessings.
Ok I will be brief...
When either using the touchscreen on my iPad Pro (updated OS, no beta) or my professional desktop Bluetooth mouse there seems to be an input issue pertaining to utilizing interactive diagrams (am currently brushing up on basic Geometry) wherein as one ‚Äúclicks‚Äù or taps upon the green dot to place or create a specific angle the OS gets confused as to whether the user is attempting to move the held line segment, line or ray rather than scrolling the page itself up and down. If the interactive diagram is at the bottom of say a review page then the problem is impossible to solve. Otherwise it‚Äôs just horribly frustrating to figure it out. So far have only had this issue on chapter reviews and not on quizzes or tests. Hope the fix is easy (my guess is that changing the ability to scroll up and down in the interactive areas should resolve this issue. Thank‚Äôs again!"	positive
3060	469863705	education	1	This app is honestly embarrassing, it crashes within 10 seconds of opening it, and that‚Äôs not a one-time runtime error or anything, this is, fully updated on iOS 12, crashing before I can even access a lesson. I have courses I need to complete for my programming class and I can‚Äôt even start to explain how terrible this app is. I can understand a whole new iOS version coming out and there being a crash bug or something not working quite right after launch, that‚Äôs totally to be expected, but this. This is honestly disgraceful. They haven‚Äôt updated this app in over 3 weeks, and it has been unusable for over 3 weeks as a result. The service itself is honestly fine, but this app is disgustingly broken. If I could actually complete some parts of my lesson when I am away from my PC that would be great, so my thought process at that point would be to download the app, and sure enough it isn‚Äôt stable enough to stay open for more than 10 seconds. As a programming student, I find this mistake on their part absolutely embarrassing and I can‚Äôt believe it still has not been patched. 0/5 stars.	neutral
3061	469863705	education	5	"I‚Äôm so in love with Khan Academy, and I‚Äôm so grateful for it!! It‚Äôs really simple to use, and it has all the subjects that I need. And it‚Äôs free!!!!
I am a foreign student who recently moved to the US, and I just started my first semester at cuny as a biology/premed student. Biology is hard, especially that English isn‚Äôt my first language. The textbook is really hard to understand and I have to translate most of the words, but Khan Academy made it so much easier for me. The language that the professor uses in the videos is really simple and understandable, yet academic and professional! The best thing is that when I don‚Äôt understand something, I can repeat the videos as many as I want!! In addition, there are articles about the same subject that I can read after or before the video!
I just want to thank everyone in Khan Academy! You guys are the best!!"	positive
3062	469863705	education	2	"The last few updates introduced bugs that make some exercises impossible to complete or progress in, even after resetting the app.

1. Formatting on many math exercises has been completely broken. Numbers and equations are duplicated (for example 11 instead of 1, 3x+23x+2 instead of 3x+2). Font formatting has been broken as well, with some problems being displayed in a mix of large and tiny font. Some multiple choice math problems are impossible to progress through because the answers are not selectable, they are formatted in a side-scrolling table which is clearly not intentional on KA‚Äôs side.

2. Inputting answers in math exercises is occasionally bugged. I‚Äôve experienced two different bugs. One causes the keyboard to retract after every button selected, forcing you to tap again and again and input one number at a time. The second bug makes it impossible to scroll left and right on the keyboard without the button you swipe on being inputted in the answer field, forcing you to go back and delete each extraneous number or sign before submitting your answer.

3. Possibly not a bug but still annoying: The ‚Äúcorrect answer‚Äù and ‚Äúexercise completed‚Äù jingle now takes over the audio on iPhone, pausing whatever music, ebook or podcast you‚Äôre listening to. I like to listen to other things while working on KA exercises and it‚Äôs frustrating to have to constantly restart whatever I‚Äôm listening to when I‚Äôm doing exercises."	negative

The best example is the writing tool. You can write on problems in math an other subjects, but it lacks palm rejection, a feature that has been standard in drawing tools universally for years, and it also lacks Apple Pencil support, which isn‚Äôt standard, but the app is on iPad so they have no reason to not quickly add it. The ui isn‚Äôt very good, ether, being tiny buttons spread as far apart as humanly possible. That makes split-screening with a calculator app, your notes, an actual drawing app, or whatever really hard, because you have to close the other app to progress. The app wouldn‚Äôt be hard to improve (and would probably only take a few minutes of work), but I can‚Äôt see anything happening soon because they‚Äôre finally updating it to support iOS 10, which came out in mid 2016.	positive
3064	469863705	education	1	I find this interface to be full of lots of glitches, and the interface self is a pain. It may take you 10 seconds to solve a problem, but a minute jut to be able to type it into the box. And it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a small screen. I use tons of other apps with iPad compatibility that‚Äôs flawless. I thought the message was to make life easier, and give anybody the opportunity to learn. But with an app like this, I‚Äôd rather carry around the textbook. Also what‚Äôs the point of mastery challenges or points, if you can‚Äôt access it with the app itself. And on a final note, I would like it if the app wasn‚Äôt so glitchy, the pages constantly quitting, going crazy and just being  so slow. If you are a teacher, please spare your students, practice problems and videos are fine but please, do not replace the textbook. After a year of using khan rather than a textbook and old-fashioned practice worksheets, I came in knowing more about pre-algebra than after, and it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not trying. It‚Äôs just so hard keeping up with it and teaching yourself	positive
3065	469863705	education	5	"First of all, Khan Academy is a great app for learning. This is what makes me give it five stars. I appreciate that I don‚Äôt have to pay and have a plethora of interesting things to learn about. This is also really cool for maybe second-world countries, for people that can afford a cheap-ish device but not an education.

The new update removed the feature where you would have to ace every test, including the unit test, perfectly in order to get to Level 5 and be done with that unit. It was hard to get 100 percent sometimes, but it really pushed me to learn and do my best. Now, there is no level feature and it makes me feel like it‚Äôs a little harder to navigate what you need to work on. I still appreciate the videos and exercises, but i thought the level feature was the cherry on top. Bring it back?"	positive
3066	469863705	education	1	this app is really bad. Not in the sense that the mechanics and such are bad, it just really frustrates me when I use it for school. It‚Äôs annoying and doesn‚Äôt help me learn at all. If anything, it makes me wanna flunk the class instead of doing the lessons and such. Some of the answers are dumb and don‚Äôt make sense. Please, make it more boring for us kids at school because it already makes us want to commit die. Some of the questions are non sensical and are really confusing. Making us earn points to get new skins isn‚Äôt fun. Nobody cares. I have 32 of these assignments due in a couple of days and I  can‚Äôt even get through 1 of these without crying in frustration and wanting to throw my laptop and phone out. Once again, this doesn‚Äôt help me at all to learn. I‚Äôve learnt nothing from this. All these other reviews from people saying it‚Äôs good are crazy. It doesn‚Äôt help any of us, at ALLLL. Anyways, I‚Äôm just a kid and nobody cares about my opinion. Thanks for making me cry all my tears for the week. I was trying to save them for other school things, but ok. Again, khan academy is bad.	negative
3067	469863705	education	5	"This is a tremendous math resource for students from elementary school through graduate school. 

HUGE room for improvement though for iPad app... 
1) have a simple button to report problems with a question. There are several errors I‚Äôve found so far, which are really frustrating. No way to report it easily. Please add this, and only investigate questions that are commonly reported to save you time. 

2) fix link to videos that come up with the light bulb... when you click on videos it doesn‚Äôt link to the video. Very frustrating, especially for young kids trying to work independently. 

3) fix fractions. To write 2 1/2 You should be able to type 2 and then the fraction button to put in the 1/2. On the iPad this is tedious every time to pull up the fractions first and then try to click the right location to put in the 2. Young people may not even be able to figure this out. Not user friendly here. 

4) add question and testing content for sciences and not just math. This would be huge for gifted kids, special needs kids and children across the developing world.  Okay, pretty much everyone...

Please fix these things and this already great FREE app could be much better!  Thank you for your hard work on this!!!"	positive
3068	469863705	education	3	The information available for free is truly amazing, when I can access it. I either got a buggy version, or maybe something else is the issue, but I have trouble doing more than one lesson‚Äîand sometimes not even that much‚Äîbefore I get a pop up window saying there has been an error processing my action, every time I try to do more than one question in a practice lesson. I can watch videos but as soon as I try to do either the practice or the mastery lessons, or the challenges, nothing will move forward. I know it isn‚Äôt my internet connection, and I‚Äôve updated the app consistently when the app updates come around. I‚Äôd like to find a way for this to be fixed, as I looked forward to learning things throughout my day in doses. A+ information, I just can‚Äôt access it most the time. I would love to give 4 or 5 stars to the app, but it doesn‚Äôt hardly ever let me practice.	positive
3069	469863705	education	5	"I struggle with numbers, in general, and found Khan Academy when I was trying to brush up on mathematics, since I‚Äôm training to be a pilot. i found the website first and immediately created an account, and was excited to have an app version as well. The app tracks my progress and offers the next appropriate training when the pre-requisites have been completed.

I‚Äôm blown away by the diversity of training on offer as well as the quality of the teaching. I‚Äôm doing math basics at present, since I missed so much of it when at school, and so appreciate the different ways of teaching that are offered. 

Thank you Sal Khan, for your vision and determination, and for producing this great app to make all this education accessible to anybody who has an iOS device, and the website for all who have internet access."	positive
3070	469863705	education	3	"Khan Academy is great. Truly amazing app. All my subjects were synced, everything was exactly like on the website. The only thing that was really bad is the drawing features, the ones on the problems that help you solve the problem on the problem itself. The first line drawn is smooth and nice, but after that there is extreme lag, and the lines are all choppy and impossible to write numbers with. It takes about 10 seconds to write a single number if I want it to be legible. (I am using the Apple Pencil) In the drawing mode, it also takes away the problem. If there was a diagram there that I wanted to mark up in order to help me with the problem, it disappears. This is a pretty big thing for me, especially if Khan Academy doesn‚Äôt work with split screen. I cannot work on the app itself, a big bummer.
Besides that, it is Khan Academy. Tons of great courses with great teaching and a great experience."	positive
3071	469863705	education	5	"I had an issue with the back button in the app but you guys quickly worked to fix it! Thank you Khan Academy! I‚Äôve changed the 4 star rating to a 5 star now. :) But please consider the following things mentioned below:
2) Allow users to download videos in high quality if they want to. I have enough storage and when I download Khan Academy videos, they‚Äôre always in very low quality, both audio and video. Give users the option to choose whether they want to save data and download in low quality, or if they can, download in high quality for offline use.
3) We can download videos to make them available for offline usage, but not articles. Why is that?
Overall Khan Academy is a great tool to gain knowledge and it‚Äôs proven to be very helpful for a lot of people including myself."	positive
3072	469863705	education	3	"I greatly enjoy Khan Academy the videos and practice work have helped me so much. I was introduced to it as a high school student by our math department. It was used as an alternative to traditional math assignments as it ensures the student is actively learning and can help teachers see where a student may need more help. I choose to keep using Kahn Academy in college as the videos often make more sense than what my professor does in lectures.

The MAJOR issue I have come across is that the app cannot be used in split view. This causes a lot of issues for me as I use my iPad for notes. So if I want to have my notability app open it has to be in a tiny floating window that is too small to write in. I have been using the website instead because the app will not allow the split view. PLEASE update the app so I can use it more easily on my iPad with other apps open beside it!!!!"	positive
3073	469863705	education	1	If these are the types of questions on the SAT‚Äôs, then why even bother? The questions are absolutely awful. They will not help anyone know what your skillset is, they only aim to confuse and befuddle your. If nothing else, they find any and all weak spots in your skills. The instructions on how to actually answer the questions are lengthy and yet terribly vague and idiotic. It gives no real insight into what you‚Äôre actually supposed to do. The questions themselves are asked in a manner that I can guarantee would confuse even the most avid reader. The hints are nearly childish. They do not give insight. If this is intended to teach, there‚Äôs something off. All I‚Äôve found is frustration and anxiety. I don‚Äôt like to leave nasty reviews, especially when I‚Äôm sure this is actually the types of horrid questions that are on SAT tests. If anything must change, it would have to be SAT‚Äôs, so take this as a message from everyone disgruntled and stressed student. Make the standardized tests vaporize and disappear.	negative
3074	469863705	education	3	"Khan Academy is a superb learning resource, whether you‚Äôre a young person still in school, a young adult in college, or just someone who‚Äôs looking to brush up on specific subjects. I enjoy using it, however, there are some things that can be added, taken away, and improved upon:

1) Add the ability to view unit and subject progression within the app. This option is available on the web version of KA, and it really motivates me to complete lessons! However, I cannot view my progress within the iOS app, which represses my excitement and causes me to not use it as often, which is unfortunate.

2) Allow the user to make all videos watched if we‚Äôve reached 100% on units! While the videos are helpful when I‚Äôm confused about a specific topic, most of the time, I already understand the concepts explained in the video, so sitting through a drawn out video stifles the momentum I build. 

3) Sometimes when I finish a unit, I do forget some of the information given, so it‚Äôd be nice to be reminded to review important concepts when KA recognizes I haven‚Äôt taken the initiative to review on my own. 

Besides that, I really enjoy using Khan Academy as a whole, and with the changes I suggested, I believe it could become an even better and more intuitive learning resource."	positive
3075	469863705	education	5	"This is an amazing app and it helps everyone work on anything they desire at their own level. I am doing high school geometry and it literally covers everything you need to know. I am still in middle school but it easier to see what‚Äôs coming and prepare with khan academy, so thanks! 

The one bug I found though was that if there is any question with multiple answers and if I put the wrong number of answers (correct or not) it would not let me move on because it says ‚Äòplease select the correct number of answers‚Äô. So it kinda helps me out because I know I either need more or less answers than I already have. Otherwise I haven‚Äôt found any bugs other than that so thanks for the amazing app!"	positive
3076	469863705	education	4	"Love the concept of this app. Khan Academy is awesome. However, the Unit Test questions in Computer Science sections are impossible to read without constant ‚Äúpinching‚Äù the screen to zoom out or in. It will not scroll down at first and when it does after multiple attempts, the same issue is experienced when you try to scroll up. For example, you read a question/problem in the test and you cannot see the answers. So you pinch/zoom and see answers but it is cumbersome to get back to the question again. It takes too much time. Sometimes I have to zoom out completely by holding the screen ‚Äúpinch‚Äù and squint to see the text. 

I urge developers to use this part of the app on their own phones (I use an iPhone 10) to really understand my perspective. 

Thanks!"	positive
3077	469863705	education	5	This app is amazing! It helps me a lot and I definitely improved in every subject! Khan Academy is my #1 absolute favorite learning app! This learning app has many subjects such as: Math, science, etc. That‚Äôs not the only good thing! This app is very organized! They have: Kindergarten, 1st Grade, 2nd grade, all the way up to 8th grade! After clicking what grade you‚Äôre in, you can choose what you want to learn! Ratios, Algebra, etc. Once you‚Äôve click what you want to learn, they have videos and practices for you after learning it, they give you a quiz! Just like what REAL teachers do! What makes this game more fun is that they give you energy points whenever you get things correct! You also earn badges! I am in LOVE with this game! Thanks a lot for the help! üòä	positive
3078	469863705	education	4	"I was really excited when I realized I could do the Khan Academy math exercises on my iPhone. I am trying to get caught up in math so I can take college calculus. And for a day, it worked great. But now, the app is showing all the numbers doubled and sometimes overlapping, and I keep getting answers wrong because I can't see them properly. I tried restarting the app, but that didn't help. And there is no place to report the problem. Help!!!

Update: the number doubling problem wasn't resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling the app. I'm working through this with support, and meanwhile just using the website. However, I also can't see anymore what I've already completed versus what I need to work on, without clicking on every topic to find out. Super frustrating!"	negative
3079	469863705	education	3	"I would be ignorant if I said that the design and overall format of Khan Academy is bad, but I do have concerns. 

I‚Äôm currently using this app for geometry and have been using the mission feature since the beginning of the school year. We have also been receiving assignments from our teacher. These assignments often have attached videos to help students understand how to complete the given assignment, but usually the problem in the video is not in the same format as the problems in the actual assignment. This leads to confusion and lots of frantic searching on the internet for an explanation on how to complete the work given. 

Another problem I‚Äôve been struggling with is that of progress. As most students would, I‚Äôd like to get as many 100% as I can in all of my classes. When doing assignments or missions on this website/app, students do not receive half credit for retrying a question after getting it wrong, and this makes it, if anything, harder to finish our work with a passing grade. 

My last problem is work load, but that has more to do with the teachers at my school than Khan Academy. 

I hope this will help in reference to further development of this app, and that the developers will take this into consideration. 
Thank you."	negative
3080	469863705	education	5	I probably would not have been able to succeed in my Algebra II class without Khan Academy. What‚Äôs great about this app to me are the quizzes and tests- if I don‚Äôt understand a problem, the app suggests video to me, and also gives hints/ a walkthrough of how to solve the problem in brief increments, so if I end up remembering, I can solve on my own. Also, when you retake a test, it gives you different questions each time. This app is almost the equivalent to having a free tutor. In addition, the guy who makes the math videos is fantastic at explaining any math concept. I rarely have questions after watching his videos, and even more rarely after reading the walkthroughs with them. This app is phenomenal, 6/5 stars	positive
3081	469863705	education	4	"I have some downloaded bookmarks but u can‚Äôt access them because the app says it needs to update them, when it seems like it‚Äôs halfway there it crashes, I don‚Äôt want to delete it and te download because I have those saved classes to not waste data when I come back to them. It‚Äôd be nice if it didn‚Äôt need to automatically update or if I could just access the bookmarks and downloaded content regardless.

I love this app because it teaches you slowly and step by step, sometimes to the point of getting annoying but it makes it easier to not get lost. As a College student with ADHD this is a life saver for when I get home to study what I missed in the physical class and I can just replay if I need to hear something again."	positive
3082	469863705	education	3	"I downloaded the app on my iPhone X to learn more about current teaching methods, as it‚Äôs been a few decades since I went to school. Having a 2 year old that I want to jump start had me looking for options and I was recommended Khan by a friend. 

All in all, I‚Äôve had no problems with the methods, other than updating myself from what I remember.

The problems I‚Äôm currently having, though, are how you‚Äôre required to use certain functions in the program. The biggest pain in the math/geometry areas is drag and drop ruler function for measuring. It‚Äôs extremely difficult on the iPhone X, as trying to nab the ‚Äúturn‚Äù points on the ruler usually ends up snagging and dragging the entire page around. 

With problems where you‚Äôre measuring the perimeter for lengths, it would be easier for the ruler to be tapped where it would align itself to the angle datum in place, then drag the ruler to measure it. I know that‚Äôs not a fix-all as some problems might need the user to make that angle drag, but I‚Äôm only up to the third grade and haven‚Äôt found them yet üò¨. 

Thanks for the product you provide, with continued improvement it can be an extremely beneficial app for parents wanting to help their kids or learn themselves!"	positive
3083	469863705	education	5	I love this app, it helps me work and in between I can watch informational videos to help me, just I had an idea. I this they should have two big problems with this. firstly, half of the time my work space online, so I have to do it multiple times, and just spam it so I forget what the problem is, which leads me to my second big problem with this app, is that while you‚Äôre on my work space I can‚Äôt see the problem I have to solve, and I forget it, and since I can only see the title of the section, I think it‚Äôs that, so you should make the problem appear onscreen while you‚Äôre using the work area and fix that little... bug. But other then that, it‚Äôs amazing, and I just found it!	positive
3084	469863705	education	5	While the app can be a bit of a bother to navigate at times, the benefits of using it far exceed the negatives. Additionally, there were some issues in a previous version of the app that have been promptly fixed by the developer. I believe this shows that the team behind Khan Academy and its app are working hard to improve their products. And given that access to Khan Academy and all its features is completely free, I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a pretty good deal. In the end, Khan Academy provides for free what others will try to swindle you endlessly for: educational content. I‚Äôm looking forward to the future of this app and the website that coincides it. I recommend that those seeking to sharpen their mind give it a try as well.	positive
3085	469863705	education	5	This app is really good for your brain like teachers can send you work And there are videos and stuff so it makes stuff easier Like you can just watch the videos and then be ready for your quiz that‚Äôs what I do just watch the video first and then do the quiz you should really try The advice I gave you so you‚Äôll be ready for your quiz and then you can get 100% on it please whoever made this game write me back I am so good at writing reviews so actually whoever is reading this review you should download this appüëå this is the best app anybody has ever made it teaches you lots of skills as I said in the beginning it‚Äôs really good for your brain you should really download this it is so good for your brain	positive
3086	469863705	education	5	"This is a marvelous app and it probably helped millions of students around the globe. However, I wish to see practice questions and course quizzes in physics or chemistry courses. For instance, there isn‚Äôt any quiz in Physics starting from Centripetal Acceleration and onwards. Concepts such as Rotational Kinematics can be quite difficult sometimes depending on the questions as you have to associate it with centripetal forces(eg. A spinning ball hanged by a rope). Thus, I believe practice questions are essential in all topics. 

This part of the review is to say that I‚Äôm very grateful for Khan Academy. It has surely helped millions of children especially those who are less privileged or are from countries that cannot offer top-notch education. A big big thumbs up"	positive
3087	469863705	education	2	First off, I absolutely love khan academy! I‚Äôve been using it for over a year on my laptop and log in almost daily, but lately I‚Äôve been riding the bus or the train to Uni. WiFi‚Äôs not available and there‚Äôs not enough room to get my laptop out so when I found the app I got exited thinking I could use my phone. Unfortunately, when I logged in, I found that I had really just downloaded a blank profile of the website. Even after logging in the app provides no indication as to where I left off, my progress in any of the subjects, or even what courses I‚Äôm currently focusing on. Since the website is so simple and helpful, is it possible for the developers to just match the app to the site? The app would be really useful, but without progress tracking I find it‚Äôs better to just log in to the main site through explorer on my phone.	positive
3088	469863705	education	3	"I think it would be nice and motivating if I could see my streaks and badges in the iOS app, just like I can online. I miss being able to do that.

Additionally, it would be really helpful to have more CS content on Khan Academy, especially based on standard CS curriculums in college, like data structures in Java and Python, discrete math, functional programming, and C Programming / Systems Programming.

Also, it would be nice if there were tutorials about machine learning, human-computer interaction, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, software engineering, and other ‚Äúsub-subjects‚Äù within CS. I think it would be very useful for college students in rigorous CS programs, especially in times when over-enrollment, lotteries, and the inability to get into certain classes is a very prominent issue across colleges and universities in the United States."	positive
3089	469863705	education	4	"My only gripe is that you can not multitask with this application unless it is a very narrow sliding window. I really want to take notes while watching the videos and rewind at the same time to understand a concept. But the best I can do is to make the video float in my note taking app. I am an engineering student and I use my iPad Pro 12.9 for all my studies and note taking. Let me put this out here first, this app is amazing for starting at one level and expanding your knowledge at your own pace! I really want to give this app a 4.9 stars but sadly that‚Äôs just not an option. 

Please keep up the great work guys! I downloaded the app to my phone and I guess I‚Äôll be squinting until the update comes. But trust me, it‚Äôs well worth it üòÇ"	positive
3090	469863705	education	5	"Love the app as it gives you a variety of topics to choose from. Whether it's math, it's science, or it's writing it can all be practiced on right here. They even have an option for you to practice the SAT's! If you don't understand what you are doing or need help, there are videos you could watch

I do love this app, however I wish there were two features we have on the browser version compared to the app. It would be really helpful if I could write on the page in order to help me solve what I'm doing or counts my time even if I am off the app to solve the problem. Another thing I wished they would add is the progress to see how long I have been working."	positive
3091	469863705	education	5	A really really fantastic app. There are very big video varieties to choose from about the specific math topic you need and each of them are very helpful. Most teachers tend to only repeat what they‚Äôre teaching about one subject once (from what I have experienced,) but with Khan Academy it‚Äôs a different story. Khan Academy presents videos of any math subject you need help on and you can repeat them anytime you want and there are a multiple videos to choose from. This is a great boost because each video has someone explain their way of solving a math subject, that way you can choose which one makes you understand that subject more. Overall great educational app, planning on keeping it.	positive
3092	469863705	education	4	I've been using Khan academy for the past 5 years and honestly it's taught me so much. But there's one big glaring issue. I've recently been trying to teach my friends math, and there is no way to share one of the videos I'm currently watching. This makes it extremely difficult to help my friends learn something, because as of now the only way I can show them the same content is by logging in on your website, and having to dig through page after page until I can find the video and then copy paste them the link. If you guys were to add a share video button inside your app I would greatly appreciate it and it would do wonders for my friends and I thank you.	positive
3093	469863705	education	5	This game was a recommended by my aunt‚Äôs boyfriend buts that‚Äôs besides the point. I‚Äôm in love with this application ! However, I wish there was a higher level, like if you are really amazing at one subject you can level up. This might be a feature, and I‚Äôm just a starter. I also wish that you can see how you‚Äôre doing compared to other students in you‚Äôre grade or subject. Although this might bring student‚Äôs confidence go down,maybe there should be a setting that asks ‚Äúenable board of leaders‚Äù or something else. You can  also use my header, I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called,. . I mean this program was free so, i do not regret purchasing this application .	positive
3094	469863705	education	4	"I would love to give this 5 stars, Khan Academy is a wonderful concept and I am so grateful to them, but the new update is really bumming me out. 

I‚Äôm studying for the MCAT and I often listened to videos on my Bluetooth while driving in the car or doing chores. I liked closing the phone screen so I wasn‚Äôt distracted by the video pictures, but now I can‚Äôt do that. Before, I could have my phone closed, I could be on other apps, I could be on the web, and the video would play in the background. Now, unless the app is open, the videos will not play, and I have no idea why this function was taken away from us with the update. Please bring this function back and I will happily update to 5 stars"	positive
3095	469863705	education	4	I find everything quite helpful especially the test preparation. However, I don‚Äôt like when I finish the units and it says, ‚Äúerror loading summary,‚Äù something like that. Then it doesn‚Äôt count the questions that I just completed. I also found that the app does have a tendency to crash. Finally, I enjoy having a place where I can write down equations, etc, but I don‚Äôt enjoy when I can‚Äôt see the problem. I click the writing tool, then the screen is white covering the whole problem. It would be nice to be able to see it. All these problems are very minor , but have become an inconvenience for me. Hopefully these can be fixed in the next update.	positive
3096	469863705	education	1	"First I would like to say I am very grateful for Khan academy, and without it I probably wouldn‚Äôt have gotten into UMTYMP. It is a math class at the University of Minnesota that gets you through calculus before 12th grade. My life has been a lot better when I qualified, and without Khan academy I am almost certain I wouldn‚Äôt have made it there. Two things have been annoying me in this app though. 

1. It won‚Äôt let me do missions. I took one mission today, and suddenly it says I have to wait 7 hours before I take another one. This is really annoying, and I don‚Äôt know what the point of that is. I like learning at a fast pace and not being able to master these limits my learning, and wastes my time.

2. For the exercises you have this scratch pad. It is nice, but previously there was an undo button and now there isn‚Äôt one. This makes it really tedious to erase. It hasn‚Äôt been much of a problem for me since I got a notebook for Khan academy, but I think it will help a lot of other people. Also since I am doing geometry, sometimes you don‚Äôt want to to it in your notebook because you would have to draw everything in the problem.

These are all the suggestions I have right now. The app is really good, but hopefully you can consider my advice."	positive
3097	469863705	education	3	Could someone please please update this app? It has so many bugs it's incredible! First each time I finish a task it won't let me try again I'll have to close the app & reopen it just to redo the same questions I was doing, another bug is sometimes when it loads it would lose connection & back out or would start the questions two times so if I went back it would have the same task open! & some of the questions aren't loading properly it would ask a question but won't load the actual thing so I could properly do the question. My internet is great, this on the math section please do something! This is my main source of studying & I have a exam coming up It's extremely frustrating trying to study like this!	positive
3098	469863705	education	3	So far I absolutely love the app and my teacher uses it for AP Gov, but it has some major flaws. In the most recent update the app has a huge problem with loading times. What used to take only a few seconds now can take up to three minutes to load. I know that it is not my IPad‚Äôs fault for it is only two years old and I still have over half of total memory remaining. By far the biggest problem is that whenever I open my profile the screen will just completely freeze. I waited for over ten minutes during this and nothing happened, so I was forced to close and reopen the app. Also, sometimes the buttons will just completely disappear forcing me to close the app once again.	negative

I absolutely recommend the site, but the iPhone app can be a bit wonky. I wish they would fix little things such as when there exponents in questions about dimensional analysis, the formatting is e.g ‚Äú2160 min2degrees, write this as s2degrees‚Äù I was finding it difficult in several chemistry equations, when dealing with exponents that the formatting was incorrect. Clearly it was supposed to be ‚Äú2160 min^2/ degrees‚Äù but I suppose it‚Äôs the way a mobile format works? 

I really genuinely hope they fix it soon because it‚Äôs the little things like that that can make it so hard to study for a test while on the go."	positive
3100	469863705	education	4	"This is an amazing app! It totally works in every way and the glitches that bothered me so much in the past. Just one minor fix so that I could give this app five stars. We need a menu button in our videos and tests. I watch a bunch of videos straight, with tests and stuff, and then If I wan‚Äôt to go back to the course, I have to press the back button a million times and go through every single lesson i watched and every test I‚Äôve completed. But the one thing that bothered me the most is that when I encounter one of those articles, I‚Äôm just stuck. I enter one, I complete the mini tests, i read the article, and there‚Äôs no next button or previous button to go to. I have to double tap and swipe the app and get back on it.

Also, I have been trying to write the letter O for a problem on variables, but I keep getting 0. If you can make it so that we can have the option to type out our answers, that would be great.

And that‚Äôs about it.

Oh wait, if you can make the profile a bit more manageable like in the computer, that would be great. Thanks!"	positive
3101	293622097	travel	3	"Ive been a fan of google earth for a long time now. I recall that the first images used to allow the bottom of the ocean exploration with a smooth transition from land to sea. With the new updates and imagery, a lot of detail has been removed. I used to remember looking at land masses and seeing the trees and roads but the current images are now blurry blobs. Also the area surrounding and encompassing Antarctica is severely pathetic. 

We the people want the details and the Truth. Why is it that there are photoshop cuts and cloud clips, that are covering up detail of the landscape? Please fire the photoshop team and tell it like it is. What good is exploring the planet in virtual format if all you get is blurred images to hide those detail? I don‚Äôt use Google Earth much any more because it is a joke now. It makes me sad that all the big corporations want to keep people in the dark, never sharing what they find. Who are you to make that judgment on all of the population. What gives you the rite to hide valuable discoveries from us? And why? It just makes me sad that you were not raised with the truth and so you find ways to cover it up :("	negative
3102	293622097	travel	2	"‚ÄúOkay. Guys we got the data in for the whole world! Now we can sit on our butts for years and years and never have to update it‚Äù...said the boss at google earth a decade ago.
I know it is free, but I have State Farm road atlases with the picture of a 1953 Buick on the cover that has more up to date maps than Google earth! Those were also free!
Their competition is buying new images like crazy and have current maps/terrain. Perhaps GE just isn‚Äôt in the game any more and are letting this program wither and die when more folks like me discover it is full of ancient artifacts instead of a current set of images. I‚Äôm in the hinterlands of the fly over in the USA...Denver Colorado. Doubt if the GE staff can spell it let alone find it on their own program. 
The images I deal with are from three to seven YEARS old. Streets, many buildings, power lines, pipelines, public facilities have been built and in place for years in the suburban areas of this city. 
There are much more current images in Tibet and South America,
Do not use this app if you are expecting to get current images. It is poor for that. 
One feature that might be helpful is to have a streamlined method to report obsolete images, or offer the ability to purchase new images of specific areas if Google cannot afford to update your area of interest."	positive
3103	293622097	travel	3	"The app is fine, nothing amazing but I enjoy it. Seems recently the detail has improved. Unfortunately it‚Äôs difficult to truly enjoy when everything‚Äôs basically approved for us to view. I used to think I could find something special item like some ancient ruins or unknown island, now days everything is photoshopped it seems. Granted I understand the blurring of military bases and such but there‚Äôs some spots that‚Äôs obviously censored from the public in a sinister way. As if google thinks they own everything the satellites are viewing. 
Things that would improve the app for me-

:Make it so street view has a toggle on off switch so I can leave it on while exploring. I miss lots of good opportunities because street view turns off automatically after leaving a specific location. 

:history like the pc version
:more the one placed marker, or saved marked spots
:more graphic tweaks
:pic overlay
Oh I forgot, Iceland, Greenland, and the islands surrounded are also very bad , the edges. Which is also ironic considering these areas are also a huge mystery. It‚Äôs as if they took a land mass or lands and chopped them up and scattered them around so not to let us view something. 
Btw I‚Äôm a photoshop specialist with a degree in geology so I know what I‚Äôm talking about."	positive
3104	293622097	travel	5	This is a great app and I'd recommend getting it. The problem is it's not all 3d and I would like you to fix that 'cause my grandfather lives in D.C. but I can't see his house and I want to really bad ( because he's rich and owns a mansion ). Other than that it's GREAT!! But you should add something where you can change the time of day ( night, midnight, early morning (2 am), morning, day, noon, afternoon, evening ) where it changes everything. For example, at day, an office building would look regular, but if you changed it to NIGHT, it would look dimmer and all the lights would be on. If you fixed/added the stuff in my review, it would be a great app. Thank you Google for making another awesome addition to my screen!	positive
3105	293622097	travel	3	"Using an iPad Pro google earth is stuck on the welcome screen and does not go any further. Clicked on the app support tab in the App Store and it takes you to a help forum for windows google earth Pro help. Useless for apple products. Really a shame googles so disorganized or just doesn‚Äôt care about low revenue users 

UPDATE: several hours later the app loaded as expected. Program ran fine, would be nice to have current or near current maps and photos, most data I saw was more than 3 yrs old. I‚Äôm thinking the startup/loading issue was not an app problem but a temporary google server issue they resolved. Still no troubleshooting info for Apple mobile users (at least none I could find) even with the issues, Google Earth is the best (free) global mapping app money can buy for the iPhone/iPad."	positive
3106	293622097	travel	5	"Not only 5-star app for iOS platform, but also for later viewing in Virtual Reality.    Using the Insta360 camera, I can upload 360 photospheres to Google Earth/Streetview via the Google Streetview app.    In the end, using the Google Earth App to view not just google content, but updated content by google users makes for an incredible end-user experience.    

This is also a 5-star review for the Google Earth program available in the Oculus App Store (free).    Using a VR platform (e.g., Oculus Rift S), you can literally ‚Äúwalk‚Äù down a street with a 360 degree view as you go.   Incredible technology.    Future is here - check out the app in virtual reality if you have the opportunity."	positive
3107	293622097	travel	5	especially if you are motoring somewhere and need a hotel, restaurant, or medical help. The Maps app is enormously helpful because in addition to the video depictions, the aural directions allow you to listen to the driving directions and watch the road. The Earth app is a fantastic aerial view of your route and/or destination, which then allows you to simply go to maps and enter the address. You can enter enroute information requests for hotels and gas stations or just about anything you want or need. It is very intuitive, is GPS synch‚Äôd, and will get you un-lost in a jiffy. You simply can not go anywhere without this app.	positive
3108	293622097	travel	3	"Decent, but is lacking major useful features such as;
‚Ä¢ Save Pinned Location, that you can custom label 
‚Ä¢ User Guide! Explaining each and every function! 
-From the upper right hand symbols (domino, measurement, etc.). 
-What each icon over buildings mean (speaking of; there is an error when tapping the icon to get information. A ‚Äòno internet connection‚Äô pops up. Maybe it‚Äôs not an error but lack of info on that place?)
-In addition to the icon explanation; add the colour of it. 
      Ex: the fork & spoon being orange, dot being grey, shopping bag being blue, etc. 

I ask that you PLEASE keep these suggestions in mind. I‚Äôm not sure if updates still occur or if the app is still being monitored by the creators. I implore these features to be made at some point. I believe it‚Äôll boost the ratings this app gets. That said! Do not rush to get the updates done and out immediately, otherwise a major bug/error may happen. Take time and update at your speed. One at a time or as a bundle. 

Pardon the wall of text and if I seemed commanding, it was not at all my intention! Just my own thoughts and opinion. 

Thank you for reading.

3109	293622097	travel	5	This app is made for a geography lover. It is an absolutely fantastic app. This app allows for some very high resolution images of buildings photographed from space. It also has voyager and knowledge cards which help you learn so much. It also has a random location button which can take you anywhere in the world. Finally, the best part is the measure feature. This thing is amazing. I have learned so much about the scale and true size of things using this. Additionally, Google Earth shows the Earth in it‚Äôs true spherical shape. This lets you see truly how much bigger or smaller things are than what you thought. Would give it 6 stars if I could.	positive
3110	293622097	travel	3	"I really like google Earth, but I would love to see a time travel feature where you can see what has changed over the decades: buildings, roads, environment, etc. Also, I think the next step should definitely be mapping the oceans; you will have work for centuries, honestly. Lastly, I want to see higher resolution imaging. One thing that I currently like is the 3D feature especially when you first tap it and the camera does a cyclical camera pan; that's awesome! Although, I would like this to be available from multiple zoom levels. Also, how about quick-zoom level buttons: 1x, 2, 5x, 10x or altitude ranges.
Google + Wikipedia would make a powerful resource for information ;)"	positive
3111	293622097	travel	5	I recommend all people getting it because it‚Äôs useful for everyone you can see any address with it I request without it doesn‚Äôt go to desert but with it comfortable find your way especially if you are familiar with coordinates of a point you can save points with x-y-z and always save in your phone like global positionally system or gps civil engineer can plan road or railroad install on this app and specify place of bridge and culvert and can use it daily of coarse it has many abilities that when use it then understand all I hope all consumers appreciate it and I wish success all producers this app	positive
3112	293622097	travel	5	I believe this app is easily accessible for apple users as it is already on your device. I find this helpful because you do not have to take extra steps to download the app. The navigators voice corresponds with your siri voice which you can change. I overall like this app because it also is very easy to understand the audible directions. Also, it easily allows you to change routes and see the current traffic. I also like the appearance of the app! I would definitely recommend this app to a friend.	positive
3113	293622097	travel	2	"Certain map/gps apps require a strong data signal to use them for travel. Being built into a smart phone makes sense in those cases. 

However, when downloading a third party app, I would hope for a more robust app that would allow usage, even in poor signal areas. You know, situations that require a map when cell signal is low or non existent?

My family and I go for car rides every weekend and go out back roads into rural and desolate areas to see what we can see. Too often we have no or very limited cell signal and the native app can‚Äôt do anything for us. 

I reinstalled GE thinking it would pick up the slack but I just found out that without signal, it‚Äôs useless. It doesn‚Äôt want to load in unless there‚Äôs strong signal or WiFi connected. We would get lost with this!

What‚Äôs the point? I remember when map/gps apps were more robust and had enough built in data that you didn‚Äôt need cell data to use them. With phone storage capacity on the rise, companies shouldn‚Äôt be afraid anymore to make a larger app that can be used standalone."	positive
3114	293622097	travel	5	This app is great, but it needs the present picture of the houses. Whenever I search up my address it shows my house but shows the cars that we had a long time ago. I also feel like the weather should change more often. I went on the app and it was 7:30 and it was dark out, but when I looked on the app it should all clear skies, middle of the day, all the nice clouds, but it would also look great in the night! All the building lights on and just watching the earth in the night!	positive
3115	293622097	travel	3	This app is amazing I really recommend getting it! But the thing is you only have a Birdseye view of the places you want to see you can‚Äôt see it like it‚Äôs right in front of you and when you Google your house it looks different from what it looked like a long time ago it‚Äôs gonna look like it looks like a long time ago is it is it gonna have a new upgrades that you put on your house. Say you Google the Eiffel tower you‚Äôre only seening what it looks like a long time ago not how it actually looks like today. That one comes really frustrates meüò°! So that‚Äôs the one problem with this amazing app.üòçüò≠	positive
3116	293622097	travel	3	"I love the power of this app. There are only a couple things I wish they would improve on. I would love to see the ability to pin locations in this that would then also be on my Google maps, or vice versa, see pins I've made in Google maps show up here. 
My other actually complaint is that if you leave the app for maybe only a minute and come back to it, it resets. Losing the location you left on. I use this app a lot researching places I plan to hike, and I'm constantly bouncing from app to app. It's incredibly annoying to have to figure out where I was every time it decides to reset."	positive
3117	293622097	travel	5	What a beautiful app. It should become increasingly obvious through using this app that their is a God of this world, that God being the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This app allows you to travel the expanse of this earth from your living room and see the wonders God has truly created that is talked about in Genesis 1, where it says ‚ÄúIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth...‚Äù To know God personally though, read his word ‚Äî the Bible ‚Äî download the app, and dive into his truth to know how you can have a personal relationship with the God who created what men can only marvel at.	positive
3118	293622097	travel	1	I really liked this app a lot. It has great info and I relied on it to show parts of the world that I wanted to learn about. Today on Facebook someone mentioned a part of the world that I‚Äôm not familiar with, the Isle of Skye. I went to Google Earth and I hadn‚Äôt typed in more than the first two letters when it suggested Isle of Skye. Apparently it‚Äôs watching other apps I‚Äôm using and since it‚Äôs a Google app that info, no doubt, is now a part of the info it sends back to Google. I should have kept it off of my phone, I figured it was harmless because I only used it when I needed it, but apparently that‚Äôs not the case. What other private info is now in the Google data base, I have no idea. If you value your privacy, stay away. Caveat emptor, as they say. It‚Äôs gone now.	positive
3119	293622097	travel	1	"Update:
Non existent support. They‚Äôre so unprofessional that they don‚Äôt respond to Apple app reviews. In my opinion, companies like that should have their products removed from the Apple App Store.

‚Äî‚Äî
I give...they'll never figure out how to design an ""intelligent"" user interface. I stopped using Google Earth a couple of months ago. The tab to unhide the place images at the bottom of the main display is too big and it should disappear when not touch for a few seconds. Then there are the four lines of copyright information that overlays the map at the bottom of the main display. You still cannot hide the GUI so you can see the the whole map without having to keep moving the map image around. By Google!"	positive
3120	293622097	travel	1	I used to love google earth about two years ago, but after a new update, the whole thing went down hill. First, the satellite view of some places, for example San Francisco, was out dated by at least three years. Second, the new up date doesn‚Äôt include Wikipedia shortcuts, or simple explanatory anymore. And, you can‚Äôt turn the stuff off the settings that you don‚Äôt want, like let‚Äôs say you only want road feature on, well tough luck be cause it doesn‚Äôt allow that. Lastly, if you scroll around eventually at least on my tablet, the app closes and shuts off for no reason. This app has so much potential and it‚Äôs a shame that it is like this. I hope google can fix there problems soon.	positive
3121	293622097	travel	3	I‚Äôve always loved google earth, but you guys haven‚Äôt updated several street view photos for years... I looked right my by work on street view and the picture was taken way before I even started working there 4 years ago. And sometimes I‚Äôll go to search for something and the search bar doesn‚Äôt even work. Same with clicking on places on the map, it‚Äôll say ‚Äòknowledge card unavailable‚Äô. Why? When it was just working 2 seconds ago... doesn‚Äôt make sense. I feel like google should have some of the best running apps but this one still needs a lot of work..	positive
3122	293622097	travel	1	Im going on a trip with my family somewhere soon and recently saved a bunch of places on google earth on a public library computer, assuming it would auto save to my account bc usually google is awesome like that. so i download the app so i can see what i had previously saved and it turns out the only way you can do that is by going on the computer you saved them to and manually moving them. and!! not only that but you cant even start all over again because you cant even save places on the app at all! so if you just want to look around places with no way what-so-ever to save the info that you find, then this is the perfect app for you!	positive
3123	293622097	travel	5	Great app! runs very smooth on iPad pro, tho images may be outdated for some areas, it is still very useful for us at work, we load our library of KML files and one feature we would like to see for the mobile version is to be able to share within the KML file as in the pro version for desktop that way we dont have to constantly switch between mobile or desktop. Please add this feature it will really help us with our productivity!!!	positive
3124	293622097	travel	2	Personally I preferred the previous version for a couple reasons. The biggest reason being that the app would save the information in a cache from areas you previously viewed. This was extremely helpful for hiking and backpacking in areas where there is no signal. By viewing areas before I left I could fully use the app out of service. Now, without a signal, the app is useless in the backcountry. Another reason I prefer the old version is because of the panoramio photos. This was nice for areas that aren‚Äôt popular. Overall the app is satisfactory but I preferred the old app with the features I mentioned.	positive

I understand that you cannot be changing your pictures every day but, my fricken door hasn‚Äôt been PURPLE for at least THREE YEARS!!! And we repainted the white door at least a year ago. Other than that I‚Äôm pretty much happy with the app, I have this exact same problem with the rest of the google apps too! Please think about updating the pictures sometime, that would make a lot of people happier with this app.

                                                                -Unanimous Person"	positive
3138	293622097	travel	4	This really made it a lot easier to make a paper on a place around the world because with google maps we can see all the special features like amusement parks or movie theatres that are famous for that area such as Canada‚Äôs wonder land but it‚Äôs also a bit difficult to find certain spots because I definitely know how hard it must be to take all these photos but it would be nice if I could see a bit more updated parts really great app in all tho!!	positive
3139	293622097	travel	4	"I don't like Google at all, but Google Earth is the one application that everyone should have on their phone.

I am the kind of person that uses Apple Maps for navigation but Google Earth and Street View for ""exploring,"" especially as a roadgeek. With the new A9-A10 processors moving is buttery smooth compared to my old iPhone 5s.

Currently though the app won't open, so this review is subject to change. Also, the removal of map caching is a detriment. But on a good day this is a great app."	positive
3140	293622097	travel	5	There‚Äôs a feature that needs to be added, The feature allows people to go in the past of earth. Going in the past will allow people to see what earth was when it was young, Maybe google can add Google ‚ÄúPlanet‚Äù. And there is another feature to be explained, That other feature allows people to zoom out and explore our galaxy and solar system.	positive
3141	293622097	travel	5	"google, I think the content and quality is really nice. I like every feature like feeling lucky and street view. But I am working on a project, and we need streets and houses of the past. Maybe you can create a Google Earth Past Version? Even though sometimes you cannot create the exact buildings, I need a past version. I need to look at buildings without searching it up everywhere online.
Thanks!"	positive
3142	293622097	travel	5	You Googlers should add a map layer to visualize the COVID-19 global spread, based on whatever best accurate data you have access to. While it would certainly be interesting/ potentially useful to get a scope of its current reach globally. It would also be very useful to be able to re-watch its spread in the future to better understand how a pandemic materializes and as a use case for how to possibly combat a similar occurrence in the future.	positive
3143	293622097	travel	1	"I read a developer‚Äôs response. It said ‚ÄúGreat news! The game has been updated. Now you can see all the up-to-date photos!‚Äù Yeah right. So you‚Äôre saying when I search up my house and it‚Äôs when my pool was being built, that‚Äôs up to date? No. I‚Äôm not blind, I can clearly see what‚Äôs outside my house and what‚Äôs not. Where‚Äôs my pool? My pool is an essential part of my house. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to recognize my house without that pool! So they ‚Äúupdated‚Äù the game? More like ignored the reviews asking for an up to date photo! Don‚Äôt download this app unless you want old photos. This especially annoys me because I don‚Äôt want people seeing the old version of my house. Sincerely,
dIsSaTiSfIeD"	positive
3144	293622097	travel	4	"I love Google earth in all the ways but I have to say they need to update at least every two years, I may be asking to much cause I know it may cost and take some time but my property and other places look different today cause we been planting plants and people had been building houses and other kind of things and it doesn‚Äôt show up.
Anyway it can be just cool to see an update picture no one with more that 6 years old.
Thanks Google Earth."	positive
3145	293622097	travel	4	This a great app but not 100% up to date like how some of the areas are 3D  but the rest are only 2D but they also need to take the picture again like at Disney the pandora land isn‚Äôt even close to being finished and it was done last year I also liked when their were pictures every where but now you can only use 20 pictures per location including Atlanta GA airport but on the other hand it is kind of a good app	positive
3146	293622097	travel	5	I love Google earth because I don‚Äôt know where I need to go and not to go Google earth is my favorite app on my iPad Pro it is one of my favorite apps because it shows me where shopping malls cities houses neighborhoods And streets and all those other stuff Google earth is a app for everybody so they know where to go.  Thank you so much for reading this I hope you have fun having this app.	positive
3147	293622097	travel	3	"A reply from the developer claimed that 2D has more updated images...not true.  2D has the exact same images as the 3D map, and the photos haven't been updated for at least five years.
But i'm just using it to explore different terrains around the globe, so i don't really mind the out-of-date photos.
i do, however, take issue with inaccurate responses.
So, developers, if you're going to reply, please be honest. i'd rather you just say ""yeah, it's out of date, eh well."" than be fed a line of malarkey."	positive
3148	293622097	travel	5	Technology has come so far! This app allows you to go virtually anywhere on this planet! It‚Äôs an amazing app, but here‚Äôs an idea; you could release an app just like this, but for iOS 11 or up, because it‚Äôd contain augmented reality! I think it‚Äôd be awesome to turn a field into a city with the point of a camera! I hope you guys get to read this, because I, along with many others, would pay for this app.	positive
3149	293622097	travel	4	I love that I can almost anywhere in the world and see it as though I‚Äôm there. However, I think the app could definitely have a much better UI (that doesn‚Äôt need a tutorial). I‚Äôm glad a tutorial is included, but no one has the time nor cares about reading through it. Google has been well known for having great UI‚Äôs with little to no learning curve until recently. It would be great to go back to those days.	positive
3150	293622097	travel	4	You have really improved this app, it runs much smoother than before, and has great new features. But can I request something? I would love to see the ‚ÄòSky View‚Äô that is part of the desktop version. To be able to see the stars and galaxies from the sky view would make this app killer. I appreciate your consideration on that. And thanks for what you have already done with it. PS I will give you five stars if you add Sky view.	positive
3151	1490078757	lifestyle	3	So I played this with a couple of my friends while we‚Äôre all apart ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù for 6 hours straight and while I will say the game is really fun, I just have to add that we ran out of questions on each topic too fast and the most annoying thing is it NEEDS a lobby, so instead of just kicking us all off and we have to send new links, give us the option to play again or pick another game while STILL on video chat. It was very annoying to not be able to change the time limit and also to get booted off mid conversation every 30 minutes, we‚Äôre good friends so of course we get side tracked and tell stories and it makes it harder to do so and enjoy ourselves. If we could customize more settings, such as time limit, or removing that all together, and have a way to stay on video together without having to back out the game would be perfect. Otherwise we decided to just switch to a video chat that allowed 3 people and we can just ask our own and look up questions. :) so that‚Äôs why 3 stars, but great concept and was fun for us for a good while. I hope to see the game develop further so we can continue playing!	positive
3152	1490078757	lifestyle	1	"Played the couples game with my girlfriend of 3 years, the questions are designed to make new couples fight, which we didn‚Äôt, but they ask how long can you spend apart, what better couples you know, what you‚Äôre ashamed of about the other person, how long you can spend a part, relive your first fight. Not only that, but the video call feature does not work, and sound only comes through the phone call speaker, not the actual speaker at the bottom of an iPhone. And connecting to Bluetooth is a nightmare, in which the audio still will not work. Overall, terrible. An unfinished copycat product that has no value in the market, filled with strange questions with a seemingly secret agenda.

update: it also forces you to write a review without asking, so I have returned after playing a second game, and being forced again, to tell you all, once again, that there is something seriously up with this game and it‚Äôs developers. Very suspicious to push out a half finished product filled with loaded, pointless questions with no real way of judging who wins any of the games, or any structure at all.
Truly just terrible. Should be removed from the App Store. I wouldn‚Äôt trust anything these people make."	negative
3153	1490078757	lifestyle	1	"My friend was introduced to the app via TikTok. We played with one of our other friends last week and it was so much fun! I would have rated the app with 4 stars and the only feedback would be that the questions are at random each time they are played. My friend and I noticed that each time you play a game you‚Äôve already played, the same questions come up in the same order. 
We decided to play it again today and realized that you now have to unlock the different games with coins and you have to PAY for the coins. I love how since the game has gotten popular that you guys decided to make it cost money. Especially in a time where the majority of the country is WITHOUT A JOB due to COVID-19. Its selfish. If you need money, then result to ads and offer a version to be paid for without ads like other apps. Not everyone can be wasting money to play a game on their phone. We just want to have a good time and a fun way to connect with our friends while we are social distancing."	positive
3154	1490078757	lifestyle	1	"I used to play this game with my friends everyday and now we can‚Äôt even play the way we used to anymore. I‚Äôm not one of the people who minded getting cut off because we would just start another game. My thing is just there is a coin system now and, if we‚Äôre being realistic, you have to spend money to get the coins you need to unlock games which is very unfair. COVID-19 has taken a lot from me and it‚Äôs been amazing being able to play games with my friends everyday. Because of COVID-19 I have recently lost my job. A job in which I was already living paycheck to paycheck. I barely have enough money to eat everyday talk less of buying coins. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm VERY grateful for this app because being able to play games with my friends has helped me keep from breaking down at times. But I am truly upset to find out that most of the games that we used to play are now on lock."	positive
3155	1490078757	lifestyle	2	"Frankly was a good game until the update I‚Äôve been playing for almost 3 months now... and NOW they decided to add a coin system. What makes you think I want to answer sex question with my family, and get to know you. I DONT. I have to wait to unlock it now. Me and all my friends deleted the game because it‚Äôs unfair when you want play with certain people. Now I have to keep reading the same annoying questions over and over to even get to the modes I want to play that‚Äôs a waste of a good game. Smh. The hype of quarantine games gonna flop after it‚Äôs over.
And over 15$ bucks for 800 coins. Most people that play this are teens with not much money due to current life events, last thing people want to pay for is communicating. Should have worked on not kicking people off every 30 mins and adding more questions instead."	positive
3156	1490078757	lifestyle	3	"This app is really hit or miss. It can be super fun to play with people both IRL and over video chat, but... 
There needs to be a lobby for video chat! Instead of just kicking everyone off between games, because that gets super annoying. 
The categories themselves- there weren't enough of them. And now they've added more, but they cost coins, and there aren't enough free categories to play. Some games cost 400 coins- it costs $10 of real money in the store to purchase 400 coins. That's kind of insane??? 
Also- the questions are super long, and sometimes make the game tiresome to get through. It gets even worse when the questions keep repeating over and over. It ruins the game."	negative
3157	1490078757	lifestyle	2	my friends & i really enjoyed this game before the latest update because you could access all the games and get the variety of fun. then the update came and now we have to struggle to get coins to unlock games one at a time. the rounds aren‚Äôt 30 minutes anymore for most games, so it goes by too fast now. not only that, but half the time, the game bugs and doesn‚Äôt give us any coins at all for a game. it was way better before the update and obviously now it‚Äôs just money-grabbing because of the quarantine. AND the developer said in a review that if you were using the app before the update, you were gifted 100 coins. my friends and I have been using it for a while and we all started with only 20 coins. ridiculous.	positive
3158	1490078757	lifestyle	5	This game has made quarantining actually bearable, the questions are so good and juicy too. I LOVE how you don‚Äôt have to pay $10 to get actually good questions. There‚Äôs so many categories that are offered and it‚Äôs soooo much fun. I just wish we could video chat with more people, and sometimes the audio doesn‚Äôt work so that might be a bug... but it‚Äôs so perfect I hope they don‚Äôt start adding ads or making people pay its such a fun game totally recommend it :) the couples questions are so fun and totally keep the romance going	positive
3159	1490078757	lifestyle	1	With us being in quarantine, this was a good app to use to connect with your friends and maintain social distance. Now with the update, which has a coin system, the love of this game decreased and we are going to delete the game. I understand that they need money to keep their business afloat, but it couldn‚Äôt have came at a worst time. We have no money to give to this app due to all of us being laid off. Quite frankly, I think the developers messed up on this one. Should have waited to roll out this coin system. On to finding another free app I can play with all my friends or making our own game because this ain‚Äôt it. The questions themselves aren‚Äôt worth the cost to unlock the other categories.	positive
3160	1490078757	lifestyle	1	Ok so basically my friends and I have been playing this game a lot since we‚Äôve been all quarantining and are not able to hang out with each other. This game was a really great way to connect with one another, but when I recently updated it, it says I now have to pay over $6 to unlock only a couple games. I understand they are just trying to make a buck, but right now is a time where we should be unifying together and make it easier on one another and the fact that they are trying to extract money from us seems really inappropriate. I guess this is how capitalism is but It‚Äôs honestly really upsetting and annoying just let us have fun for free pls while we r stuck at home.	positive
3161	1490078757	lifestyle	3	I really have been missing my friends since this whole quarantine started. I think the creators of this game should be taking advantage of this time to get people hooked on their game. You have the video chat play feature.. but there are so many issues with it. It kicks us off and makes us resend out the invite and it only allows 4 people at a time? Come on! I know it would be way more fun with up to 8 people. For the sake of humanity, please fix all the bugs and upgrade your app. I appreciate and can envision the game you have created, now make it a better reality.	positive
3162	1490078757	lifestyle	2	I am not enjoying the new update. The game used to be fun where you can choose any of the games offered and it was a 30 minutes time limit. Now there is only one ‚Äúfree‚Äù game that you can play and it is 9 minutes only! I hate that! And the other games they have you need to pay for it in coins that you earn from the only game available to play and sometimes you may not even earn coins for playing that game! There is a game that cost 400 coins meaning 40 games of the only game available and maybe even more because you may not earn coins every round. I do not like the update and it is not fun anymore!	negative
3163	1490078757	lifestyle	4	"My friend group has been loving playing this game every night as a way to get together and have some fun since we can‚Äôt see each other. I‚Äôve been recommending it to other people and so many of my friends are playing now!! Thanks to the TikTok ad I saw! 

PLEASE add more people to the live video play option, we have to leave out a lot of friends with only being able to play with 4, it would be amazing if we could play with up to like 10 players or something."	positive
3164	1490078757	lifestyle	5	I thought that this game would be so cliche and just the other games I‚Äôve played but it completely proved me wrong. I played this game with my friends during social distancing and it made the day way less boring and depressing. We all got some laughs outta the questions but the game also got serious and we really had to be honest about how we answer the questions. Would highly recommend this game to other people so they can thrive in social distancing.	positive
3165	1490078757	lifestyle	1	I really did enjoy this game prior to the update. I understand needing to sustain yourselves but make the prices for the coins more affordable. We‚Äôre all in quarantine right now and struggling. This could have been the app that got our minds off the negative and positively reconnected friends in a fun way. There must be some bug or something because I didn‚Äôt receive the ‚Äú100 coins if you were with us prior to the update‚Äù and then when I played the game with my friend and I won, I didn‚Äôt even get any coins. Does just the winner get coins or do all players? All players would make more sense and then just give the winner more.	positive
3166	1490078757	lifestyle	4	"my sister introduced me to this game and it was so much fun before the new update. being in quarantine it was a great pastime, my friends and i love it. before the update you could access any and all games, but now it cost coins to access the games AND the games are shorter in length. the coins aren‚Äôt even a reasonable/ affordable price. definitely deleting this game, it is not worth it.
*they made some more of their games free which i really appreciate during a time like this"	positive
3167	1490078757	lifestyle	5	I love this game and the concept, and I can‚Äôt wait to experience all the updates you put on!! Honestly, makes this quarantine life a lot easier I thank you SO MUCH!! 4 is a good number, but is it possible to extend the max video chat number to 6? I feel like I‚Äôm actually socializing with this game which is great, but the more friends the merrier!! Again, thank you guys so much for coming out with this game in a time that people really need it lol	positive
3168	1490078757	lifestyle	4	Love this game and have really been enjoying it over quarantine and when we‚Äôre not able to get our friend group together but it‚Äôs hard having 5-6 people that want to play over the video call and only 4 are allowed in at a time. Would be really nice if you could have 5 or 6 people in and able to interact instead of a small group of 4 when trying to utilize the video feature.	positive
3169	1490078757	lifestyle	5	Now that I‚Äôm finally able to play the game I‚Äôd like to give it five stars. I love the concept and the gameplay. Some of the questions were really embarrassing and at times thought provoking. Hopefully more questions will be added soon! Btw Developers, there is a glitch where if you tap success it brings you back to your turn again (you have to reask a question).	positive
3170	1490078757	lifestyle	1	When I first downloaded the game all the modes were free. Now you have to earn points to get to new games modes and that takes the fun out of it. I enjoyed just jumping to different game modes with my fiends when we got bored with a category. I also had the game before the update and did not get the 100 coins. Do all of my friend now have to complain just to have some fun in quarantine? I understand you guys are trying to make money but why take it out of the hands of teens and college students. We are all broke and needed something to keep us busy. Just shows how much people will go to make a buck	positive
3171	1490078757	lifestyle	1	I saw the ads on Tik Tok and thought it looked like something fun to do while me and my friends are under quarantine since we can‚Äôt hang in person. So we downloaded it but were disappointed to find you had two options of game play and anything else you had to pay for. The video chat option is laggy and the sound is terrible. Until we hooked up to headset we couldn‚Äôt hear each other at all. It was like souls level of a whisper. The games are short and you don‚Äôt get many coins for playing or winning. I think we‚Äôll stick with Houseparty thank you very much.	positive
3172	1490078757	lifestyle	1	I got this game to help me escape from the craziness and connect with my friends. I truly loved it and it started to become my favorite game. Now with the update I am deleting the app. I DO NOT WANT TO PAY TO COMMUNICATE especially when I have no other choice. I feel like it is wrong to start charging people in the middle of a crisis. This app was number one and now I totally disagree with that. You should have updated the time limit, change games without send a link when everyone is already on, increase the amount of people. NOT CHARGE PEOPLE. If you need to make money why not use ADs? I would not have an issue with ads.	positive
3173	1490078757	lifestyle	1	I downloaded the app and went to play a Game and when I tried to play it asked for my name and birth year (which is stupid because I put 2002 but because it didn‚Äôt ask what DAY or MONTH in 2020 it assumed I wasn‚Äôt 18 which I am my birthday was in the beginning of March) and after I chose another birth year due to the broken system it still wouldn‚Äôt load up it kept loading and loading and when I reset the app it kept me at the gradient monkey screen and after multiple attempts and re downloaded I Refuse to Try again until there is an update to Fix this!!	negative
3174	1490078757	lifestyle	5	This app is amazing I had my first phone call with a crush on this app and now they are the love of my life, we found out so much interesting things about each other and we use this for fun all the time. There‚Äôs so many fun activities you can do together in a relationship and as friends, definitely worth getting!!	positive
3175	1490078757	lifestyle	1	My boyfriend and I were playing a game and everything was going well until my screen went dark and then my boyfriend‚Äôs went dark as well. We both tried to go on again and it was not letting us play again. So we deleted the app and re-downloaded, but it just kept us both on the monkey screen. I would love to continue playing if the bugs are fixed. My boyfriend and I are long distance for the time being and this was a way for us to play games and have fun. Hopefully things can be fixed soon.	positive
3176	1490078757	lifestyle	1	This game was really fun and I was enjoying playing with my friends and girlfriend, but the new update ruins everything. The different games were all free and unlocked earlier, but now you have to pay to unlock them. C‚Äômon, devs. It‚Äôs quarantine and this is one of the games that I, along with many others, was playing to keep in touch with our friends. It‚Äôs a cheap shot to try to squeeze money out of us. If this isn‚Äôt changed back in an update, this game will be losing me as a player, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be losing many others.	positive
3177	1490078757	lifestyle	1	I was on the app playing with my friends and it hadn‚Äôt even been 10 minutes into the game when something went wrong. My screen turned black and it said both my friends disconnected and when I asked them what happened the same thing happened to them. I decided to check if there was a place where I could maybe email the developers for help but they don‚Äôt even have a help and support option. I am very disappointed and hope they could fix the problem.	positive
3178	1490078757	lifestyle	4	I love playing this game at night with my friends...especially during quarantine. Plenty of games to play without having to come up with a million questions. The only issue is that we wish there were more people able to play. Instead of just 4 players, we‚Äôd prefer maybe 8-10.	positive
3179	1490078757	lifestyle	3	It‚Äôs a great idea and I‚Äôve played a few times with friends, but you should add a no point option where it‚Äôs questions and answers only, doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù or not. The point system is just (ironically) pointless in my opinion just because it never tells you what you are scoring on.	positive
3180	1490078757	lifestyle	1	The first round I played with friends was ok. Second, my screen went black and said they had disconnected. They had the same problem. So we tried several times more, nothing changed. Tried different games and they even being the game hosts. Nothing stopped the black screen. I eventually I downloaded and re-downloaded it. The problem started right off the bat as if I did nothing. This is a good concept, just wish I could actually play.	positive
3181	1490078757	lifestyle	2	Ok, I‚Äôm gunna make this short. The app itself is fun, and I‚Äôd highly recommend it for anyone that wants to play games with friends while in quarantine. The downside is that questions are repeated way too often and the coin system isn‚Äôt that good, it‚Äôs kinda weird that you need coins to unlock stuff.. I know it adds another experience to the app but it‚Äôs not really that enjoyable with it.	positive
3182	1490078757	lifestyle	1	"This was a really fun game that my friends and I have relied on to have fun during this awful pandemic. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was in you guys to become one of THOSE apps. I get. You tryna get the bag, but cmon, not like this. The idea that you have to pay 10 dollars for ONE GAME is absolutely ridiculous. I‚Äôm so ashamed to have called you a fun app for the last week. Let me know when you grow up and realize how childish you‚Äôre being. Have fun in irrelevancyüòò.

3183	1490078757	lifestyle	1	Sounds fun but I don‚Äôt like how I have to video chat a stranger to ask a question and my husband refuses to use smart phones and I don‚Äôt have friends in the first place cause I am almost 30 years old with 2 kiddos I am an extreme introvert when it comes to strangers and stuff it‚Äôs weird my lifestyle is basically quarantine plus Becuz the quarantine the gas prices are cheap land  I feel like I am 16 years old again that‚Äôs been grounded üòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠	positive
3184	1490078757	lifestyle	3	This game was so good and fun yesterday. My friend and I played all night, but today I had to update it. When I opened up the newly updated version, I realized you now have to collect coins to unlock all the games. I think this makes the game so much less fun. It takes a long time to collect coins and it makes the game tedious. I want the old game back!	positive
3185	1490078757	lifestyle	3	This is a fun game to play with friends but the lack of support to change simple things such as the time on each game or the number of players before it becomes QR codes is annoying and hard to enjoy. If there were more features this might be a better app. But for now, it‚Äôs just another meh truth or dare game	positive
3186	1490078757	lifestyle	2	So I‚Äôm guessing this game is with whoever has the app downloaded. Thought this would be a great thing to have to play with friends, but having it to everyone needing to download it to play, I think is ridiculous. Didn‚Äôt get a chance to play it, even though it sounds like a fun game to play, my friends or family would not download it. I guess I‚Äôm uninstalling this app.	positive
3187	1490078757	lifestyle	3	My boyfriend and I really enjoyed all of the topics but we could not play a full game from beginning to end. It kept glitching and skipping turns or not even letting us proceed after like two or three questions. If these glitches could be fixed the game would be perfect!	positive
3188	1490078757	lifestyle	5	When I first saw this game, I knew it was gonna be a cool party game for my buds and I, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. We‚Äôve made plenty of inside jokes with the games and laughed hard with this game. I look forward to seeing what is added in the future! :)	positive
3189	1490078757	lifestyle	1	I played this game two days ago with some friends and it was a lot of fun because you could play any game for 30 minutes. With all of social distancing we need a fun game like this but now we can‚Äôt play any game because we don‚Äôt have enough coins to play at all. You are taking advantage of people during this time just because your ‚Äúgame‚Äù is blowing up due to social media exposure and this pandemic. It‚Äôs SAD af.	positive
3190	1490078757	lifestyle	5	During this period of social distancing and self isolation, the video chat option with this game has made it a great way for my friends and I to stay in touch and entertain ourselves while doing it!	positive
3191	1490078757	lifestyle	1	This game was a really good idea and really fun me and my friends enjoyed playing it , one day I logged on and they are now charging coins to play the game. My sisters and I wanted to play the sibling round and we were shocked to find that it cost 400 coins to play , we shouldn‚Äôt have to play the other catergory because it tends to ask personal questions. I hate that this app has turned money hungry and I‚Äôve deleted it from my phone.	positive
3192	1490078757	lifestyle	3	It‚Äôs a cool idea for a game, but I don‚Äôt like that the only options are ‚Äúvideo chat‚Äù or ‚Äúside by side‚Äù. I wish there was an option to play where we can both be in separate places and not have to video chat for the answers. Like be able to type them out instead of the other options	positive
3193	1490078757	lifestyle	4	Me and my boyfriend play this since we are stuck in quarantine and it is so much fun! Tho it kinda gets annoying with the time limit and repeating questions. Would love it if we could have longer time to play!	positive
3194	1490078757	lifestyle	5	Extremely fun games and apps that really allow you to get to know not only your significant other but friends. It would be awesome though if you increased the number of people to play with.	positive
3195	1490078757	lifestyle	1	i got this game a few weeks ago during quarantine and it was so much fun to play with my friends. then one day, i opened the app and all of the games that we once loved to play cost money? absolutely ridiculous. especially during this time where we all have to be careful with our money. i am outraged and will no longer be playing until it is changed back to how it was before.	positive
3196	1490078757	lifestyle	1	"@ developers y‚Äôall really think you could suddenly start charging people to play your game and not get negative reviews? Rip. 
Greedy, greedy, greedy. Obviously taking advantage of the fact that because of this pandemic people are stuck at home, bored, & desperate to find new ways to entertain themselves. Not only that but the cost to unlock the games is stupid high. Smh gross. 

For anyone looking HOUSEPARTY is similar and their stuff is F R E E."	negative
3197	1490078757	lifestyle	1	I was playing this game when it was completely free, when they updated to payment as annoying as it was I respected it. Now with this latest update it removed the game level i already payed for and did not give me back the coins. And with how expensive coins are, it‚Äôs not worth paying $10 just to unlock one level with a lack of question variety.	positive
3198	1490078757	lifestyle	1	I saw this app in a ad and I was excited about using it with my friends and when we were about to use it. It didn‚Äôt let us continue from entering our birthday. It just stayed there ‚Äú loading ‚Äú and I tried refreshing the app and it just stayed loading with the monkey on the screen. I hope you can fix this problem because I‚Äôd like to enjoy this app with my friends :(	positive
3199	1490078757	lifestyle	1	This game lets you play for about 10 minutes before randomly freezing. This has happened multiple times. It must be a bug that needs fixing. Also even when I had 42 coins I couldn‚Äôt buy a game that cost 20 coins and was instead taken to the coin store and asked to spend $5.99. It‚Äôs not worth downloading, just FaceTime your friends and look up dares instead.	positive
3200	1490078757	lifestyle	4	My friends and I love this game but there are only so many questions before we get endless repeats. If more were added- or if there was a feature to add your own tasks and questions that would be amazing!!!	positive
3201	919087726	education	2	This used to me my go to app for help on math homework-mainly to check the steps or for help. I have used the app through my 6th/7th grade year to now. I‚Äôm now a junior in high school. They have taken off the option of viewing steps for free. I get the company having to pay expenses as it grows, but now that they have blocked solving steps, this has just become a normal calculator. The steps were the key to the success of the app. There could be other restrictions. Examples such as only blocking text books, video tutorials, having ads, word problems, etc. Now, I don‚Äôt know what to do because I don‚Äôt agree to paying this much. Annual or monthly fees seem excessive for the amount that they are asking. Especially, considering most of these users are children and young adults ranging from 10-24 years of age. Many people don‚Äôt have money or no extra to spend. If they do want to restrict this much then they shouldn‚Äôt have it for a monthly or annual fee. I‚Äôd probably spend $8 for the app over all, up front. This app is not much cooler than Minecraft which people barely spend $7.99 for. With the amount of people who have this app, if you only charge eight dollars for it all, then you would have just enough to pay expenses. The payments have blocked too many of the things that truly matter. It was a great app until they added all the extra fees.	positive
3202	919087726	education	5	This app helps me everyday with my homework and it makes me understand how to do it, also I don‚Äôt just copy the answer it gives me. I try first by myself without the app for about 10 times then If I don‚Äôt get it any of the times, I scan the problem and then I know how to do it so the next time I have a question similar to that I know how to do it. It‚Äôs really helpful and it helps me improve my math in school because it is really hard for me to focus during math class because I have ADHD and I get distracted really easily. It also improved my math a lot and I‚Äôm not good at math so I scan the problem then the next time I have a similar problem at least I know how to do it. Also I know that the developers made this app for educational purposes for everybody all over the world. Even parents struggle and they need this app to help them sometimes. So this probably the best app I‚Äôve gotten and my friend recommended it for me. It also has helped me a lot the past year and this year. Thanks to developers for making this app or else I wouldn‚Äôt have even understand my math problems that much.	positive
3203	919087726	education	3	I‚Äôve been using this app for 2+ years already and it is truly a life saver. I use it mostly for checking if my home work is correct and it is amazing. Explains everything that happened in the equation in an easy to understand manner. I also very much like the app‚Äôs appearance for some reason, it‚Äôs very clean and elegant. All of this being said, after all of this time enjoying it I cannot use it anymore. This being because my phone‚Äôs camera broke. When it first broke, the app kept working fine.  I could still use the calculator that is in the app, but I had to delete the app for some time because I needed space on my phone. When school started once again I downloaded it and the app won‚Äôt even let me use the calculator because my camera isn‚Äôt compatible. Needless to say I regret deleting it, I don‚Äôt understand why it doesn‚Äôt work now when it did before and my camera wasn‚Äôt working. I really wish you could use the app even if your camera wasn‚Äôt working, or at least make it so you can use the frontal camera on your phone, I have seen the frontal camera support in other math apps (none of them are as good as this one though).	positive
3204	919087726	education	5	Ooooooooooo my... what is happening... my mom always told me that one day I would be good at math. I told her, ‚Äúmom, the day I become good at math, pigs will fly.‚Äù I think pigs just flew. I read tons of reviews, all with five stars, saying this app saved lives. To test it, I wrote 2+2 in a shimmery purple jell pen on the back of my hand in the dark (not pitch black but lights off blinds closed 8:00 in the morning) and it was like oh yeah two plus two is four voilaaaa!!!!! Like woah... either I died or the world was enchanted with a magical spell cuz I am actually looking forward to doing my homework on Monday. My integrated math textbook is full of really hard word problems and ik the app can‚Äôt do word problems, but easy as pie I can write down a number problem for those word problems and this app will save me hours that I could be spending on other homework and sleep. Woah... also it‚Äôs FREE??????!!!! Before I did not get math and I had to get my older sister to tutor me but she will be off to college soon and I will be left tutorless. It‚Äôs true... this app saves lives.	positive
3205	919087726	education	1	Why is this 10$ a month for what used to be free? You do understand most of your users are young people middle school - college and a lot of us can‚Äôt afford another monthly subscription in our budgets especially for something that used to be free. I like to get things broken down and explained on how they go the answer but now with this paywall I can‚Äôt do that anymore and it‚Äôs irritating because now all I have is the answer but no knowledge of how to do it. I understand if your developing new things with this app and this cost money but why charge for the old functionality why not just charge for the new features? Honestly even if someone wanted to use this to cheat and/or get a quick answer it‚Äôs still pointless because 90% of the time the teacher/professor wants to see how you go that answer so this app is useless even on that front too! If this app was a 1 time fee to download or was like a 0.99 - 5$ a month subscription or had different levels of payment for different features then I‚Äôd be ok with it and gladly support the devs but this app dose NOT justify 10 dollars a month it doesn‚Äôt provide enough value for 10$ a month lower your prices. And this would be the best app I ever downloaded.	positive
3206	919087726	education	5	"My math instructor has been out since October and we‚Äôve been having multiple substitutes that can barely teach. I‚Äòve started to use PhotoMath again as I used it all the time to help me with homework, yet that being said I discovered that there is a feature new I didn‚Äôt notice. PhotoMath Plus.
I was trying to learn how to do an equation when one of the steps needed me to pay for PhotoMath Plus to find out how to use it. This isn‚Äôt all that helpful when I, and maybe other people, want to learn how to do it correctly because this is probably the best way they can while they‚Äôre at home too. I had never seen this feature before and hoped that the developers wouldn‚Äôt add it in, but here we are. I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs terrible and you should remove it, but it‚Äôs not the most effective way to get more money.
Im conclusion PhotoMath is literally the best calculator app u have ever used, and I have recommended it to others and they enjoy it as much as I do. Five stars."	positive
3207	919087726	education	5	I got this app because I was struggling in math and needed to do my homework. I downloaded this app and it seemed pretty great. I copied down all the and the answer and moved on. I didn‚Äôt even bother trying to learn it. One I went to school and when math time came around it didn‚Äôt go so good. I got all of them right but apparently I didn‚Äôt do my work right. My teacher gave a whole speech about how she was aware of the things that we can use to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù and she would catch anyone who did it. I would talk about using the app among my group but I would try not to say it really loud. I think she heard me and she also said that the work was not the way we did it in class. She gave me a 0 on all the homework assignments that she could tell that I‚Äôve used this app. She said that she would of gave me a detention but I was honest with her about using it. I think this app should show different ways of doing the problems. And not just for coping but for learning the way that our school wants us to learn.	positive
3208	919087726	education	5	IXL. This app helped me conquer the most treacherous challenge I could face. IXL. It all started one day when I came home from school and was like how am I gonna do this IXL. Just then my friend texted me and was like hey what is the IXL. And I told her and I was like I'm stressing from all this IXL. So then she suggested Photomath. After that my whole life changed. An IXL that would usually take me two hours only took me ten minutes. I am so thankful. Whoever is reading this just know whoever created this app should earn an award, they are a genius. So if your ever skeptical about your math, or your having trouble just go to Photomath. And its not cheating either, it actually explains the problem step by step to help you, if cheating feels really uncomfortable for you. I already know how to do the curriculum and our teacher gives us hard IXLs because we are honors and she thinks we can handle it. But each of those problems take like an hour to work out. THANK YOU PHOTOMATH YOU SAVED MY LIFE!!!!!!!!	positive
3209	919087726	education	1	"So I‚Äôve been using this app for many years and not a single ad comes up (mainly because I‚Äôm not at home) but even if I‚Äôm at home using my WiFi and using this app to help check my work there will never be an add but now there is which is kinda annoying I admit but this also tells me that the company who made this app now wants money, maybe not like other companies where they want loads of money for personal uses.

But besides that I‚Äôm just outright confused on how will the photo math app learn to solve other equations when I can‚Äôt find an option that lets me tell suggestions on what kind of math problems it should answer for. Also many schools don‚Äôt use math textbooks and I‚Äôm wondering if there will be modules from mathematicsvisionproject because they have many math problems that this app can‚Äôt even solve. 

Also there is a paid version which helps you explaining how to do the work and having more textbooks, which I see now that this app is pay to explain which I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. Like why would this company charge for the explanation and more textbooks, not ok to have that because they literally had it for free."	positive
3210	919087726	education	5	Big thumbs up to this app!! It is very helpful with making problem solving simple!  it not only helps you find the correct answer to a difficult problem but also shows you the steps to get there which is how I learn!!  Thank you for making this app!!!!! I don‚Äôt use this app to get me out of doing assignment... I struggle with math and I will try to figure out step by step a problem and then will compare my steps with photo math and then will do a similar problem by using the steps photo math provided. Boomers will say lazy students only use this app and that is not true at all. I‚Äôm an honors student because I worked to get there. And this app has not carried me there. It has only gave me a stepping stone there. This app does not work for everything but is so helpful to a lot of things. If your using this app and Acing assignments but then bombing tests that‚Äôs your own fault. Use this app to learn... Thats the reason it was made.	negative
3211	919087726	education	4	"This is a wonderful app. It‚Äôs nice to use after finishing homework and checking to see if I didn‚Äôt make any mistakes. This app other than Mathway, are big life savers for high school. Although the app seemed to be working fine, after an update, which I like in some cases has this terrible glitch on the camera. IT WILL NOT FOCUS!!!! üôÑ. This is very frustrating because I‚Äôll spend like 10 min trying to get it to focus because it can‚Äôt see it. I would really ask if this be fixed. I‚Äôve also did some test, it‚Äôs not my phone camera cause I have no problem on the regular camera. I‚Äôve also did many things like make the little scanning rectangle bigger instead of small, further away than close up and it doesn‚Äôt help. The only thing that SOMETIMES works is lifting it up at a object far away then very slowly bring it back to the paper. Once again, great app,
but please developers, please fix this problem
Thanks and have a wonderful day."	positive
3212	919087726	education	4	I‚Äôve been using this app for a while for help the teachers seemed to never be able to give me because either they were bad at explaining or didn‚Äôt know what exactly they were teaching. It doesn‚Äôt just only give you the answers, which is cool, it‚Äôs always helped me figured out exactly what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing and how to do it step by step. However recently I‚Äôve come back to it because school started up again and I got frustrated that you now have to pay to see the steps just like many other math apps. I lived for the fact it was totally free and was probably my favorite of app of all time for school. Now it‚Äôs just a little irritating that I can‚Äôt see the step by step explanations anymore, but I only see the answer. I still am in love with the app though, just a little bummed out at the fact that I now have to pay for it, and I would pay for it but I‚Äôm a student so that doesn‚Äôt really work out too well.	positive
3213	919087726	education	4	I love this app a lot it has helped me so much. But I have a few issues that I would like to be fixed. I really wish that it had more solutions and different methods. It doesn‚Äôt have everything for classes like pre-cal, calculus, or trig. It has most of the course work but some things just aren‚Äôt there. And sometimes it‚Äôs really frustrating. Also the app something likes to cut out my music, and doesn‚Äôt like to work when I‚Äôm listening to music. If I have music playing and then go into the app it will cut it out and pause it. Or if I already have it open but I go to different app and then go back to it by double clicking my home button, and then it will pause my music. And if I had previously had the flash on, and then go back into the app it will just not work completely. So then when both of these things happen I‚Äôll have to close the app, and open it again. Sometimes this will happen multiple times while I‚Äôm using it.	positive
3214	919087726	education	5	This is the first review I have ever written. I felt obligated to write it because of how great this app is. I want to respond to the notion that this is an app primarily used as an easy way out in high school math classes. It is so much more. I am a researcher in an area that requires a lot of math to understand. I have a deep understanding of how to use math but had a poor education in lower level mathematics. This map is an enormously helpful tool for professionals to skip over the tedious algebraic processes and focus on the meaningful applications and theories. It is a tool to overcome the failings of your 8th grade teacher, and let you focus on the problem at hand. This is the kind of meaningful innovation the world needs more of. And the developers choice to release it as a free app is nothing less than benevolent. This app deserves more attention than it has recieved. Seriously, thank you for making this.	positive
3215	919087726	education	5	This app has saved my life billions of times and made math a lot easier for me. I‚Äôm not saying this because it‚Äôs good for cheating, but because it tells u the answer and work for that problem. The feedback is unbelievably fast and is now one of my top used apps. I would choose  PhotoMath over calculator because it‚Äôs just so simple and easy and u can just take a photo and it will tell u the answer and work and it‚Äôs just AMAZING! This makes my math homework so much faster because if there is one problem I can‚Äôt solve, it delays my homework to another hour. This gives me the work and it‚Äôs so easy to understand. This app is better than all those other apps so definitely think of this one! I know this review is very long, but it‚Äôs just to tell you that this is an app you would wanna download! If I could rate this more, I would say 100 stars! LOVE THIS!üòçüòçüòç	positive
3216	919087726	education	5	"Hey Cashy Joe, I just read your review and I kinda agree with your take. However, I just completed a math question and I was unsure if I did it right. This app assured my I did not only with the right answer but also with how to do it. It even referenced my exact textbook, where I could have just checked the answer in the back of the book. There are plenty of ways to do homework assignments without actually doing them. But in the end those who get the scholarships are those who understood the content. Any Joe Shmoe can get good homework grades and colleges completely recalculate a students GPA. Homework grades aren‚Äôt getting anyone into college. I simply believe the criticism this app is getting, it doesn‚Äôt deserve. It does it‚Äôs job and it does it the best. I came here to support an app that keeps on improving and getting better. I believe Cashy Joe should support it too. 

Keep it up Photomath!"	positive
3217	919087726	education	5	A million years ago when I was in college, I spent hours and hours teaching myself calculus by working the odd problems whose solutions appeared in the back of the book and then reverse engineering them to figure out how to work that type of problem.  This allows me to do the same things to assist my son with his more difficult Algebra problem and to ensure he is working it correctly and if not, on which step he made a mistake.   We use the ‚Äúshow other methods‚Äù button quite frequently to learn to work the problem in the way the teacher wants it worked. Brilliant idea and I am thrilled it will even let you neatly write the math problem and it can still read your handwriting to allow you to look for the solution.  It really helps with word problems that your kid can set up but struggles to work or wants to check.	negative
3218	919087726	education	5	I don‚Äôt usually write reviews. But i want to first off say that I love math ,but there are some problems that are just too hard for me to understand or the ones i know how to do but it is just too time taking for me. I want to say this app is completely amazing. I first tried ‚ÄúSnapCalc‚Äù first because I saw it on an ad, but it didn‚Äôt last long since I had to pay monthly for it after a few problems, which i obviously was not going to do. The solutions it showed were confusing anyways. This app is SO MUCH BETTER, it has helped me on things I don‚Äôt understand and I can learn my mistakes in minutes and I am in love with it. The best part about it is that it is FREE, completely. Since the time I‚Äôve been using it, I don‚Äôt recall seeing an ad (though I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing one). I just want to say thank you and I‚Äôll definitely being using this app for life.	positive
3219	919087726	education	5	"Normally don‚Äôt write reviews and I was skeptical using this app. I‚Äôm getting back into college taking low level math but some things I understandably get stuck on. While I‚Äôm taking an online class, it‚Äôs hours before the professor gets back to us. I do the online video lecture then do the homework.

 I don‚Äôt use this program unless I‚Äôm absolutely stuck and again I just don‚Äôt get the answer to plug it in; I read and write out the steps in the solution. It‚Äôs like having the professor guiding me through the problems I have without having to wait all day for a response. I‚Äôm sure it will help me on my future tests. Wish I found it earlier when I failed my first test this semester. I was going to pay for an ad free version or in app purchase that sent a couple bucks to the developer but I don‚Äôt see the option."	positive
3220	919087726	education	3	"I‚Äôve been using this app since 6th grade and it honestly was life changing, i would never do good in homework until I downloaded photomath which was a completely free app that not only gave me the answer to a math problem, but gave me a step by step explanation of how to solve it. Great right?
That was until recently when they started pumping the app with ads and won‚Äôt tell you a detailed step by step explanation unless you pay $10 for premium a month. This app used to be such a big help for algebra, but now I feel like it‚Äôs just about paying to get an answer. I get that everything can‚Äôt be free, but for students they don‚Äôt really have the money to pay for a monthly premium. I really thought that this app had a charm to it, it was a students learning tool that was completely free. I‚Äôll still use the app for checking my answers, but I can‚Äôt really get how those problems were solved."	positive
3221	919087726	education	4	Let me start by saying that this is a great app. I‚Äôm in grade 8 and in honors math. For the first quarter, I got the worst grades I‚Äôve gotten in my whole life! I just didn‚Äôt get it. Now, I have a tutor and that‚Äôs been helping me tremendously. On nights when my tutor doesn‚Äôt come and I have hw, I can use this app to help me do it. It gives a great explanation that I can apply towards the rest of my assignment. The one HUGE problem, however, is that it never focuses!!! I have to wait a whole two minutes for the thing to focus, if I‚Äôm lucky, or just have to type it into the calculator. My solution (now, I‚Äôm no app developer but I think this would work) is to have that little feature where you can click on the screen to get it to focus. I have an iPhone 6s so I‚Äôm pretty sure that has the autofocus feature but it still doesn‚Äôt work. Please do something about this!!	positive
3222	919087726	education	1	I do not see how anyone can claim this isn‚Äôt cheating! The developers have designed a clever and amazing app here but in the long run this doesn‚Äôt teach math. It‚Äôs perpetuating the rampant cheating problem that has been brought on by the internet age. Math is a process of trial and error and requires memorization and logic. This doesn‚Äôt encourage that or teach it. The developers should be ashamed of themselves for creating this and students should be ashamed for using it. And if you are a teacher who has suggested it as a good app for your students, then I question your teaching skills. It seems like laziness to encourage your students to use a cheating app to learn how to work a problem they you should have taught them how to figure on their own. It‚Äôs flat out cheating to use this, especially when there are struggling students working their butts of to learn math and aren‚Äôt using cheats. Maybe I am an old fuddy duddy but in my day we had to figure it out on our own. There is entirely too much cheating going on in education these days because of technology.	negative
3223	919087726	education	2	I‚Äôve been using photo math since the 6th grade. This app has always taught me things that my teachers didn‚Äôt. I would‚Äôve given this app 5 starts a few months ago but when I came back to the app, they wouldn‚Äôt explain the steps to a problem unless I pay for a subscription. I understand you have to do what you have to do but photo math has never been this way. This app always walked me through my problems and help me understand the concept of certain topics. Now I‚Äôm not able to learn the thing I need to learn. Children are already at home not getting the education they need due to COVID-19 and photo math is like an at home teacher. Is there any other way to get my math questions explained step by step? Because I don‚Äôt feel I should have to pay to receive the information and knowledge I need to be successful in mathematics. Photo math has turned into a regular calculator since you aren‚Äôt able to be walked through your problems anymore. I am no longer a fan of the app.	positive
3224	919087726	education	5	This app has changed my life. I love it and it works so well. I HAVE NEVER LOVED SOMETHING IN MY LIFE MORE THAN THIS APP. IT HAS BROUGHT MY GRADE UP SO HIGH AND NOW IT WILL HELP ME GET A JOB!!!!!!! I was in a deep depression these past years all because of math. This app motivates me to do better and has SAVED MY LIFE. I have never felt such feelings for something. I owe my life to this app and it has caused the best things that could ever happen to me. Whoever created this app is  an actual god and should be blessed with happiness and fortune. I cry every night. Tears of joy for this app. Now I am a regular person and hope to get a job soon. I pray to this app whenever I use it and always cry and scream to know how thankful I am for this app. It has moved my life into a position it has never been in and I hope it moves others too. Thank you photomath for saving my life.	positive
3225	919087726	education	5	"This app is very handy, and convenient. In school, I usually have tons of math worksheets that I have to do. I know how to solve all of it though, and I can probably get it done..... if I wasted 5 hours of my life! Thanks to Photomath, I can get work done quickly while being taught the steps. This app is not only a time saver, but has really taught me math better than my own teacher in some cases surprisingly! With that said, there are also a few problems. 1. There are some things I've tried that it couldn't solve. I know it can't solve EVERYTHING, BUT, it can solve a whole lot, so I'm not that mad. 2. It often mistakes an ""s"" for a 5, and a ""g"" for a 9, which gets on my nerves when it happens. I know though that as this app progresses even more, it'll become more and more accurate so I am overall pleased with this app.

3226	919087726	education	2	I‚Äôm studying for my GED and math has been my worst subject since forever. My previously foolproof way of ‚Äúgetting it‚Äù was this: 1. Read subject in book 2. Watch khan academy video explaining it way better 3. This app was my last defense against stumbling on a problem. The way it breaks down every possible step to the equation makes it so easy for not-so-math-smart people like me. Today I‚Äôm studying like always and stumbled on another problem, pull out my handy dandy Photomath, and.. it prompts me to start a subscription, of course when I try to figure out the part I really didn‚Äôt understand. The initial step breakdown is still free, but when I click the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù button and saw that my heart sank. I never write reviews on anything, ever. I just had to voice how disappointed I am in this. I know we live in the day and age of subscriptions to apps that don‚Äôt need them but feel entitled to charge you anyways, but something as simple as this is disheartening at best.	positive
3227	919087726	education	5	I had this app when like barely anybody used it and it SUCKED and didn‚Äôt work at all. Then all my friends started talking about again and so I downloaded it and WOAHHH it had changed! I use this app in and out of class and it has been a life changer. Story time: (side note- we use workbooks that have our hw in them and we rarely have worksheets in google classroom but we did today) It was like 6 minutes before class started and he decided to tell us that he was collecting our ws that was hw from last night, I thought we would just put in our workbooks when he collected them, so I had 6 minutes to do the rest of the problem on the ws (there were like 12). This story is getting to long so in the end I rushed and finished all the problems. PHOTOMATH IS AMAZING AND HAS SAVED ME FROM GETTING GROUNDED!	positive
3228	919087726	education	4	I just want to say that I really respect the devs for not making students pay to see the explanations for their solutions, because they are the only ones out there that I have seen do that. You are able to scan your math problem without having to take an actual photo or you can type it in, and you can also see how they solved the problem. They even graph certain problems and offer multiple ways to solve them. The only two complaints I have are that the app takes too long to focus the camera and it can‚Äôt solve problems with imaginary numbers. I find myself having to wiggle my finger and move my phone up and down each time I open the app, and whenever I try to solve a problem that takes the root of a negative number, it says it is undefined. Anyways, that‚Äôs my opinion, so thanks for reading.	negative
3229	919087726	education	5	"HOLY CRAP!!! This app is a true life saver! My math teacher is CRAZY and gives us tones of homework that is waaaaaay to advanced for my grade (plus she explains really badly and is overall a horrible teacher).

This weekend I had something planned that was very important but, of course, my math teacher thought I‚Äôd be a perfect time to give us TEN PAGES filled with complicated algebra problems...

In a desperate search of the internet, I found this app. It‚Äôs the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me. It not only gives you the answer, but gives you a clear step-by-step explanation. It can solve ANYTHING! Thinking that this app is simply too good to be true, I was expecting tones of ads and payed special features, but no, this app is ad-less and COMPLETELY FREE!!! WOW!!! Thank you to whoever created this app, you are an angel sent from god himself!"	positive
3230	919087726	education	5	My teacher in the beginning of the year was great, but when the second month of school hit she just started giving out homework after homework and I just got sick and tired of it. One of the reasons I am using this app is because it saves so much time as a high school student and secondly she doesn‚Äôt even grade the homework that takes us 30 minutes at minimum! I am not a D or F student in math  at all, instead, last year I would finish every quarter off with over an 100 in math without even knowing about this app while all my friends would struggle. Math just comes easy to me but you need to take your time so if you‚Äôre a busy person I would totally recommend using this app because it will save you hours that you could be using for other useless homework .	positive
3231	919087726	education	2	I was hoping this would actually work, unlike other apps. What lame excuse for not being able to solve it is this ‚ÄúOh, we can‚Äôt solve it YET, let‚Äôs do it later.‚Äù Totally stupid. When I saw the reviews, the majority of it was 5 stars, but tbh, the 1 star people had pretty great reasons to give as to why this app is a complete waste of time and effort. The problems it scanned didn‚Äôt even give me an answer, it also provides the wrong explanation and answer. For example, when the problem wanted me to round to place values, it converted the numbers to decimals and fractions(which was NOT what I was learning at the time), making me extremely confused. If any parent downloads this for their children, they will regret it. The kid‚Äôs homework will be all wrong (probably) and they will have wasted time listening to stupid/false ‚Äúexplanations,‚Äù which answers aren‚Äôt even related to the problem. Again, I suggest everyone not to buy this STUPID FRICKING APP. FRICK YOU DEVELOPER	negative
3232	919087726	education	5	I never write reviews so the fact that I am writing one right now is incredible. I decided to take a few minutes to say that this is a magnificent app. I have used Mathway before, but this one is ten times better. Mathway doesn‚Äôt show you how to arrive at the answer and the steps to get there, it just tells you the answer. I admire this app so much, it helps me with a majority of my math problems and shows you the steps and how to do them. I also tried another app similar to this one which I can‚Äôt remember, but this one is better than all the rest. Some things I would suggest is adding more textbooks like ‚ÄúSaxon Math‚Äù Algebra 1 and above because Photomath doesn‚Äôt support the answers to word problems which is what I struggle with most, but other than that, great app!	positive
3233	919087726	education	2	"I have used this app since I was in middle school. It has helped me tremendously in understanding how to answer questions I have lots of difficulties with. But yet again, you now have to pay to get any explanations to the problem entered. It was a good app until they started to charge the user. My best guess is that the majority of users who use this app are kids still in school, mainly middle and high school. Now yes I‚Äôm assuming that college students do use this app as well but they probably only make up a smaller portion of users. So it‚Äôs very disappointing that yet another app that I use as turned to making the entire use of the app into a profit disregarding that a majority of people who use it are most likely unable to pay. 
       Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for a quick answer and that‚Äôs all then this is the app. But you will not get any other information regarding to how the answer was gotten."	positive
3234	919087726	education	5	"I recommend you guys to use this app! 
It‚Äôs an awesome feeling to understand math! I have a professor who‚Äôs not really that good in teaching. He‚Äôs a kind of professor who just sits and read what‚Äôs on the book. Sure, you can learn something but what if you‚Äôre a kind of person who has to learn every single detail? üôÇ That‚Äôs right, I‚Äôm that kind of person. I wanted to understand everything in detail. üôÇ When I started using this app, I was amazed because you can easily understand everything since it‚Äôs explained in detail, üôÇso I was happy because I always get A‚Äôs on my quizzes and tests. Try it! FYI, I‚Äôm not a math person. üòÇ in fact l, I hated math, but it‚Äôs a good feeling when you‚Äôre actually leaning ‚Äúmath‚Äù 
Thanks for this app! It‚Äôs very accurate and helpful! üòä"	positive
3235	919087726	education	4	I love the app. It‚Äôs great for homework because I use it to check work for problems I am unsure of rather than waiting for the next school day. However, this app is limiting in ONE area that I‚Äôve noticed so far: imaginary numbers. This cannot solve ‚Äúi‚Äù equations and I feel that this makes the app very primitive compared to other apps that are similar and can do this, yet they have a smaller budget. For example, Cymath is a web-based and app based photography solver, yet it can do imaginary numbers. In addition, any problem with ‚Äúf(x)‚Äù will be listed as no solution in the app unless I person sly change it to a ‚Äúy‚Äù. I know this ‚Äúf of x‚Äù is picky, but the imaginary numbers part is very crucial and adding it sooner rather than later will convince me to change my rating as well as summon a whole other wave of downloaders.	positive
3236	919087726	education	5	"This is a spectacular app!   I downloaded it thinking if it was half (0.5) of what it claimed to be I would be completely (100%) stoked!   I must admit, this app is all I could have expected and more!!!   It is fast, efficient, accurate, and it makes reviewing my child‚Äôs homework a breeze!!!!
   I‚Äôm no mathematician by any stretch of the imagination, so I have forgotten many of the methods used in teaching the basics.   This app saves me time from having to look everything up on the web, refresh my memory, then teach it to my child.   I just scan the problem, view the resulting output, and it all just seems to come back to me!!!
   Thank you so much to the creators!!!   You should be brimming with pride in knowing your brain child is of such great use!!!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"	positive
3237	919087726	education	5	"This app is amazing, I go to one of the hardest schools in my country and this app has helped me understand so much material, the scan feature is spot on, I have terrible handwriting, even some teachers can‚Äôt understand it, but this app can understand what I wrote in a mere second.

Photomath provides an in-depth solution for every problem, showing you the solving steps in an instant, along with a simple, not hard to understand explanation below it. It will show graphs for equations and even has a built in calculator which is very easy to use and can input stuff that your average calculator can‚Äôt.

Overall, I would rate this app a 10/10 and a must have if you‚Äôre a student, it provides a simple, understandable ad-free experience."	positive
3238	919087726	education	5	I love this. I was looking for an app that would help me with something. Since I am not that smart I was stupidly placed in one of the smartest classes in my school and I kept failing every test. After weeks of failing and lost my confidence I found this app. I started reading reviews and saw that pretty much everyone gave it 5 stars and how it helped them so I decided to try it out. I did a couple of problems and started to do my homework and every answer that I had was right. It had helped me so much. It pretty much saved my life. I went from getting F‚Äôs to getting B‚Äôs. And that is thanks to this app. It saved my life and I recommended it to my friends who were having trouble with somethings as well. Thanks so much for making this app that can help anyone!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è	positive
3239	919087726	education	5	The app is great to help double check you math and get some tips. This app overall improves my math and I think it great. While you may not download it because you think it‚Äôs expensive and other reviews are saying it‚Äôs too much but if you buy it it‚Äôs basically a online tutoring program and if you need it it‚Äôs worth the price. If you don‚Äôt want to pay that‚Äôs fine because you can still use it to help you check your math and provides a few steps on how they did it with is great considering that most app would make you pay 7 dollars a WEEK just to use that app and there wrong have the time. I‚Äôve been using this app for quite some time and I would recommend it to anyone as a great math checking app.	positive
3240	919087726	education	5	OMG!! So I never write reviews on anything but I‚Äôm writing this one now because I feel as if people underestimate the app. I had downloaded this app because of a friend and I didn‚Äôt know if it would actually work but when I tried it on my regents homework (algebra) it worked and I was so surprised it saved me hours of time and I was able to even go to the cinema afterwards, and the app doesn‚Äôt just give you the answer if you click the little arrow it shows how to actually do the problem yourself so it‚Äôs a tutor in a way too because of this app I now know how to solve algebraic equations by myself but I still use this app to check my work so I would definitely recommend this app to all even adults can use it!!!	positive
3241	919087726	education	5	Whoever created app must have been heaven sent to solve the worlds problems. This app is amazing. It helps me more than a tutor! If it wouldn't have been for this app. I don't know what I would have done. Thank you guys so much! All throughout school I've failed math, I've never had a solid way to learn math, until I found this app, this app had truly changed my life, I owe everything I have to the person who designed and created this app, I hope they are truly blessed! I can't even understand how I would get through high school or college without this app, I can't believe it's free, they say the best things in life are free, WELL THIS APP ONLY CONFIRMS THAT! Thank you so much Photomath, I owe you everything in my life!! Because you saved my life!	positive
3242	919087726	education	5	"Allow me to explain what is so different about this app than the rest: It is able to solve problems, even difficult one. To be honest, I had my doubt that this app could possibly solve complicated problem. An example would be:  (4-x^2)(1/3)[(6x+1)^-2/3)],(6)-[(6x+1)^1/3)],(2x). Other apps would be like:""this cannot be solved, but this app was able to solve it correctly! And the problem was a pre-calculus one! This is why you should invest in this app, and great job to the developer! People say that this is cheating, but cheating means if you just try to find the answer without any solution or process on how it was solved. This app shows you the answer and the entire process to getting the solution, so you are learning from it, not cheating."	negative
3243	919087726	education	5	This app is bomb, I recommend to everyone. Even if you aren‚Äôt enrolled in school or have a job that presents you with difficult math problems, you can enter literally anything and this app knows the answer. I missed two weeks of college and took pictures of the problems on the grades homework assignment I was assigned, which was on the material I had missed in the two weeks, and the answers were broken down step by step and I got a 100 on the assignment. I would have had to watch probably an hour and a half worth of educational videos to understand the concepts if I had not used this app and had everything broken down for me in such a simple way. This is the best app in the store. I wish I came up with the idea.	negative
3244	919087726	education	4	i‚Äôve used photo math for majority of my middle school/high school experience. this app was always helpful by showing me the proper way to do certain problems along with the reasoning behind it. now you have to pay $10 per month just to have an equation explained. please consider removing this feature and let the explanations be free. i understand that the company needs a way of income but consider making other features have an annual/monthly pay instead. for example, with the PLUS feature it gives you the explanation of how the problem is solved but also gives a ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù selection to further explain as to why the problem is solved that way. please consider making that a PLUS feature instead of the explanations.	positive
3245	919087726	education	5	My teacher doesn‚Äôt really give us the best notes and HW assignments are nothing like the notes or example in class so I‚Äôm here struggling becuase I have nothing to reference. With Photomath it teaches ya how to solve it and for about 2 years now this app has done a better job of teaching me how to solve problems and helping me recognize where I made a mistake better than my teachers. I find myself using the app less and less (this is a good thing) because it teaches me how to do problems I might see in the future. I high recommend this to any student struggling but make sure to try at first and to not copy the answer because then your only hurting yourself for test and quizzes. Use it as a guide not a cheating tool.	positive
3246	919087726	education	5	Okay, so EVERYTIME I hear about these apps they can never do anything other than solve simple subtraction, division, multiplication, and addition problems meant for elementary schoolers. While that‚Äôs all nice and dandy, that‚Äôs what the calculator that comes preinstalled on every phone is for. But, when I downloaded this app a couple months ago in the midst of a mental breakdown over some algebra homework, I practically sang Hallelujah. It solves almost every algebra, calculus, and geometry problem I throw it‚Äôs way! My friends and I even gave it a name (Jeremy), and they joke about how we have been in a relationship for the last few months and that he has been helping me with my homework every day. Idk why y‚Äôall needed to know that, but I seriously do love this app.	positive
3247	919087726	education	5	"It‚Äôs definitely possible. Taylor Swift or whoever the heck said ‚Äúnothing is perfect‚Äù is WRONG, wrong, wrong, wrong. This app is simple to use. Some people say that users don‚Äôt actually learn by using this, but the feature where it shows the work is just amazing, and the opposite of that. My friend can only help me so much in math, but with this, I can use it much more. I recommend it to as many people as possible. Sorry to repeat, but I just love that feature about showing the work.

This app is already at it‚Äôs peak performance, but that performance could be done even more.... as a Widget. This is probably a bit much to ask, considering you‚Äôve done all this already, but a Widget version of this would be great. Thank you, so much."	positive
3248	919087726	education	5	Ok so I was struggling. In math especially with division and using this app I didn‚Äôt exactly just get the answers for the problems are use this app to understand how to do the problems and this really help me and I got all A‚Äôs in my math classes for division because of this app so I‚Äôm reading this five stars because this app helped me so much and I just want to thank you guys for having this up and well it made math so much easier for me and it worked with almost all of my problems but then I go to solutions and it gives me a solution for the problem so I understand it better than what the teacher thought so thank you photo math and because of you I got all A‚Äôs in the unit of division in my class so once again thank you	positive
3249	919087726	education	2	"Have used this app for more than a year, but recently they added a subscription where you have to pay for it explain it to you. I understand wanting to get some money out of the app and the developing of it but why‚Äôd you have to change it? Now you have to pay for things that you didn‚Äôt have to pay for before? Bring back the old version!!  I don‚Äôt just want the answer but I am not going to pay for the explanation. I am literally in school how could I have the money to pay for the subscription. I honestly really loved this app for a long time but if your looking for an app like this don‚Äôt use this one, there are probably many others that could do the same for free. And the ads!! they‚Äôre so annoying especially when i‚Äôm literally trying to do work.

Please change it back to the old way."	positive
3250	919087726	education	5	Pre-Calc is definitely a hard class for me. I‚Äôve been struggling with it since the beginning of the year. My friend suggested this app to me and I brushed it off thinking I‚Äôm not a cheater, but this app is not for cheating. I scanned my completely difficult problem and was shocked to find that it gave the right answer. Not only that, but it gave an in depth explanation with a graph to help. I now understand what I‚Äôm learning for the first time in months. I‚Äôve been struggling through this class with a barely B- and can finally bring this grade up! It‚Äôs not for the answers, my teacher gives us every answer to the problems. I can finally have math explained to me in a way easier and fast way. Thank you for this app!	negative
3251	467329677	education	5	This software is absolutely phenomenal and works flawlessly as far as I‚Äôve found ways to test its limits, and believe me I‚Äôve tried. Just snap a picture of the problem. Can‚Äôt get a clean pic? No worries, it knows you‚Äôre doing other stuff and it will ask you to crop out what isn‚Äôt relevant when it sees that‚Äôs necessary. Don‚Äôt have it typed out and your handwriting isn‚Äôt the greatest either? ‚ÄúTry me‚Äù, says this app. Just take a picture of the problem you‚Äôve written down (probably as nicely as you can for best results) and be amazed as it clearly translates your writing into maths! The app will then ask how you want it solved (cause we all know there‚Äôs more than one way to skin a math problem), and will then give you the most simplified answer to the problem in a timely and polite manner. If, after your homework is done, you appreciate this modern miracle as much as I do, try showing it your appreciation like I did :). It knows what you‚Äôre saying to it! Depressed? No problem, tell this baby you love her and feel the warm loves you receive in return! In all seriousness, this is a spectacular product and it is free.. FREE! FREE I TELL YOU!	positive
3252	467329677	education	5	This app was god sent when I was struggling to find a way to check my work, understand the material and how to ‚Äúget there‚Äù. Other apps were limited in offering comprehensive solutions, would not offer one or worse, would come up with answers that would make you question what you were doing. Not this app! It gave me the option to choose from a vast list of options on how you‚Äôd like the problem solved (graph functions, asymptotes, critical, inflection points, local absolute min/max, x,y intercepts, slope, log, 1,2,3..derivatives, etc, etc, etc). I went from fearing the ‚ÄúCheck answer‚Äù button to being confident my work was right because it was backed up by Mathway‚Äôs answers, which were spot on. I started seeing a lot more ‚ÄúCorrect‚Äù responses and more 100% results. A ‚Äúmust have‚Äù in your toolbox (free or not). I truly believe that the few negative reviewers in here don‚Äôt understand the app‚Äôs potential or simply expect it to do 100% of their work, with 0% effort on their part...	negative
3253	467329677	education	1	"I‚Äôm am math major and use this app to check work when I‚Äôm unsure. I‚Äôm almost done and have had problems the entire way through. When I first started this app was awesome it could any simple math up to calculus with no problems. Things like basic integrals were no problem for this app but once you start to do more difficult or complex integral the app responds with I‚Äôm unsure how to solve this problem. Sometimes I want to solve a polar equation let‚Äôs say and it won‚Äôt give me the option. It will graph it but if I use the variable r first it shuts down. I have to turn it into a rectangular equation then type that in which to me defeats the purpose of the app. A ton of my upper division math classes are kinda hard so I sometimes need an app like this to check work when I‚Äôm lost and have depended on this app for so long but recently it has let me down and I will most likely delete it.

So I ended up deleting this app because I was tired of it not being able to solve anything. It can‚Äôt solve pretty basic limits like lim x!/x^n it just tells me that it‚Äôs unsolvable even though I could do something like this in my head. If you are not serious about math then this is a great app if you then don‚Äôt bother."	positive
3254	467329677	education	5	I‚Äôm a student in college who got stuck in a crapload of math classes to learn programming, and I‚Äôm stuck using a self-pace website. And it‚Äôs only gonna get harder when I get into Trig and Calc. This app? I can‚Äôt rate it enough. I have no words to describe how..HAPPY this app has made me, and how much it‚Äôs helping me. Not only does it *show* you the answer, but it shows how it came to that solution, too. Certain subjects sure; I know. It‚Äôs simple and I don‚Äôt need this app for some. But for things like dividing polynomials, that‚Äôs the stuff I never learned. This app helped me pass a good portion of my class!!! The fact you can see how the solution came to be is...phenomenal. It really helps *UNDERSTAND* the logic behind it; not just how, but what to do exactly, without a tutor standing behind you watching you. 50/5 stars. If I wasn‚Äôt broke, I would DEFINITELY pay for this app so much! It‚Äôs definitely worth every penny that‚Äôs ever been in my account!	positive
3255	467329677	education	3	This is one of the best calculator apps I have found on the App Store, but it has some issues that I wanted to mention. Some of the user interface tools are kind of weird (especially fraction related tools) and parenthesis and other formatting methods. I had previously used Desmos, an online graphing calculator, that I find did a much better job with ease of inputting questions. My largest concern is the ‚ÄúI am unable to solve this problem error.‚Äù For extremely basic problems the calculator is fine. Once I try to do something even remotely complicated it tells me it is unable to do the problem. Questions that aren‚Äôt even difficult seem to much for this calculator to handle. I often have to resort to typing my question into wolfram alpha, which does have the computing power to answer my questions (it just takes much longer to type in). I wish Mathway was able to solve my math problems, but it seems like more than half of the time the problem is too complicated.	negative
3256	467329677	education	2	This app is cool. It‚Äôs a graphing calculator on my phone and that really comes in handy when I don‚Äôt have my actual calculator on me. But one thing that makes me dislike this app is the fact that you can put in any equation and it will solve it, but you can‚Äôt see how to solve it without having to pay for premium. It just gives you the answer and you have to figure out how to find that answer on your own. I‚Äôm in calculus and sometimes have trouble figuring out problems and I use this app to help me sometimes. But most of the time I just become more confused than before I knew the answer to the problem because I look at the answer and just wonder how in the world did it get that. It just gets really annoying when I‚Äôm doing homework and I don‚Äôt understand a problem but I can‚Äôt get any help with it.  It would be really great if step by step could be a non premium thing or if it could be both whereas some of the extremely hard and more in depth problems are in premium and all other step by step was in non premium.	negative
3257	467329677	education	5	"Seriously. I wish they‚Äôd pay me to write this because I‚Äôm a broke college student (worse because of the quarantine happening now) but ANYWAY. This app saved me. I‚Äôve been using it since last semester when I took remedial Algebra, and it‚Äôs saving me again this semester with advanced algebra and trigonometry. I don‚Äôt know what it is about being bad at math that makes you feel horrible about yourself, but struggling in my classes really took a toll on me until someone told me about mathway. It‚Äôs worth the subscription cost because I‚Äôm not failing anymore. The step by step guide is fantastic, and I love being able to choose how I want a particular equation solved. To the wonderful people that made this app (and keep it running) : thank you from the bottom of my heart. 
TLDR; this app is worth every penny, it‚Äôs a lifesaver."	positive
3258	467329677	education	1	I never write reviews but, I really love this app when I first got it. Which was probably in September 2019. I loved the helped that I got with my work and let me understand better. BUT the new update they just did a week ago, is absolutely terrible. I‚Äôm receiving adds, which is frustrating because I‚Äôm trying to get my work done and it‚Äôs taking longer than it should be, I understand an ad every single time you open the app or on the side. But I‚Äôm getting ads every three questions. I‚Äôm just trying to check my work, to see if I got the answers right. Another thing that is bothering me is that the camera won‚Äôt focus I would type in the questions but I‚Äôm doing algebra right now and it‚Äôs a mix of numbers and letters and it just would take me even longer. I understand again that the camera isn't focusing once in a while but this is every single time I try to use it. I just deleted the app and I‚Äôm going to use a different app for now because I‚Äôm getting frustrated with this.	neutral
3259	467329677	education	2	"Sent to 2 help requests and 2 days later I received an answer to them that I just needed to delete the app and re download.  I told them I had already done that and sent another request.  That was 3 days ago, still no help.  
I‚Äôm trying to put this app on both my iPads and it won‚Äôt let me put it on the second one.  I quit mathpapa app because this one is better but if I can‚Äôt get any support when needed I will not keep it.  I use Facebook to sign in to the 2 Nd app and yes my Facebook and iTunes email are the same I only have one email address for everything.  I have tried deleting the app and re downloading it,  even made sure the show work button was on before redoing the subscription.  Will work but when I need to see the steps on a problem it just shows a blank page.  I have 2 more years of math I need this app for and want to keep it, but if I cannot get this resolved I will have to try to find another one."	positive
3260	467329677	education	2	My experience with it was very bad as I didn‚Äôt pay money for it. I tried to take a picture of my question so they could explain it to me. First of all, I took a picture of the question but it kept saying it doesn‚Äôt understand it. Even when I kept trying and it worked a couple of times, it never sent and put some random fraction which I knew for sure was the wrong answer. For premium it might have been better, but for not paying any money, it was a flop. Sometimes it kept freezing up and that was hard to work with. I had the answers to my question, but only the answer but I kept getting the wrong answer and I thought I was doing it right, but I downloaded this so I could see the explanation, but that was for premium only, and I didn‚Äôt want to spend my money on it and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt. Please make it better for people who didn‚Äôt get the premium version!	positive
3261	467329677	education	5	I use this app when Photomath isn‚Äôt giving me the answers I need or in the form that I need them. This app asks you what exactly you‚Äôre solving for and what form you need it in so that you can get the answers you need. The layout looks nice and seems easy enough to use, though I haven‚Äôt used all the features/symbols. I use this for everything from basic algebra to pre-calculus and trigonometry problems and it works great. You can also use your camera to take a picture of the problem and this features works perfectly almost every time. If it doesn‚Äôt, you have the option to edit the problem yourself. Would recommend this app for sure.	positive
3262	467329677	education	3	Now I got this app a while back and have been using it for a while. But my math teacher wants work done so in that case where I needed an app for easy math but had to do work this one didn‚Äôt do that. It shows you the answer and you can change how the problem is answered but to show the work you need to fork over 10 bucks a month which is a scam. One of the best functions is the camera scanning and it‚Äôs how I used the app most of the time but I got fed up with it and looked for a better app and found one that lets you take the photo choose the way to solve it and it shows the work for free (for those wondering it‚Äôs an app called Photomath). So instead of getting this get photomath it‚Äôs easier and more efficient	positive
3263	467329677	education	3	My first experience with Mathway was great! I could check my work, get help on problems, and more! Until I downloaded the app. I realized, it‚Äôs not everything it looks to be. I like the idea of being able to take a photo of the work, but why not allow me to insert a photo? Most school work is online now, and if I could just take a screenshot and insert my photo, it would be so much easier! Another thing, is the ability to copy and paste. If ONLY I could. Simply copy my math problem, paste it into mathway, and hit enter! But no. I have to sit there and type out even and entire paragraph of a word problem sometimes. And it‚Äôs a pain. Yes! It gets the job done! But there‚Äôs a LOT of improvements that could be made. Please take this into consideration.	positive

Hi, I‚Äôm Danasia Mitchell and when I tried mathway it changed my life I never though that there was a solution out there to help kids like me.I tried Photomath and it really isn‚Äôt that much help but when I tried mathway it just blew me and my teachers away.I have passed every single test I‚Äôve took now I‚Äôve been making 80+ and above and we love it just keep up the good work!üëç‚ù§Ô∏è"	positive
3265	467329677	education	5	"Update: the app is fixed and working great!!! Thanks 

Update on this app!!! I purchased this app so that I can take advantage of viewing steps. Well it started working for a few months and now it will longer give me the option AGAIN!!! This is so annoying!! Now it just gives me an option so that I can purchase live tutor for $110. Why would I want to purchase live tutor when I can‚Äôt even view the steps of a problem and that‚Äôs what I paid money for!!!!üò° THIS APP IS NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE AND IT IS ANNOYING!!!! When a person spends their money üí∞ they should get what the paid for at least!!!"	positive
3266	467329677	education	5	Greatest 10$ a month I‚Äôve ever spent. I needed a tutor to help me study for the ASVAB which one section involves Algebra & Geometry to get into the military which are my weak points in Math. I specifically needed someone who could break down Algebra steps for me in simpler terms than just giving me just answers. Being a dyslexic who‚Äôs a slow learner, I need step by step solutions to HOW the problem is solved so I can understand how to solve the equation such as (Solve for X & Y) type of problems or questions involving PEMDAS. It‚Äôs like having my own tutor but working around my time and my pace. Well done!!!	positive
3267	467329677	education	1	"For many simple math problems, the calculator app that comes included with the iPhone works much better (although it doesn‚Äôt graph, or handle complex numbers). For graphing and complex math, there are web sites that work better and are free.  It also lacks a programmer‚Äôs calculator option (for base conversion between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal).

As far as paying for explanations of solutions, it would make sense (if this service is really so great), to allow at least a short free trial period.  I don‚Äôt recommend buying it sight unseen. I certainly won‚Äôt. Especially with the poor quality of what I CAN see without payment. 

The number of 5-star reviews strikes me as a bit fishy.  Given that there are people who write positive reviews for a living, I suspect a lot of these (mostly one-sentence) reviews are paid."	positive
3268	467329677	education	5	I love this app. I wish I had known about it sooner, it is beyond helpful. Currently taking calculus and I have been struggling to understand certain concepts. All I do is type the equation in and it will prompt me on how I want it solved, so far it has always had the option I needed (have had the app for two semesters, pre-cal and calc.)Then it solves it step by step and you can expand every little detailed step until to you get to the final answer so you can see how to solve it on your own! I love it! I purchased the annual subscription and honestly it‚Äôs well worth the money, you‚Äôd pay more for a tutor.	positive
3269	467329677	education	4	On my iPhone XS Max running iOS 12.1.2, the app crashes every single time I search for a question pertaining to the problem. The only way for me to avoid these crashes is by scrolling to find it, which as you know can be very time-consuming. I am in Calculus and I can confirm that this app helps with the basics of Calculus, and nothing further. It would be awesome to see some future updates that could change that. Thanks, this is an honest review and a 4-star is deserved since it helped out immensely at the beginning of the semester despite me having to scroll each and every time. Have a nice day :)	positive
3270	467329677	education	3	I have been using mathway as a paid customer for over a year and half now and i has gotten me through all my math classes pretty well. In calculus 2 now we use series or sequence and and the app cannot even solve one single problem i put it in its always ‚Äúim unable to solve this problem‚Äù why even have the option of a capital sigma button if they app cant solve a single problem with it!! What you need to improve on is the algorithm of this app to actually be able to solve those kind of problems like Symbolab can, this app is better at explaining steps if you can improve on advance math like this it would be perfect.	positive
3271	467329677	education	4	Can you please update this app to have more college algebra, calculus, and especially trigonometry stuff. This app works really well if you have algebra, algebra 2, and, geometry problems. But if you have a higher level high school or even college class like trig or calculus, it won‚Äôt have everything you will learn in that class. And sometimes it‚Äôs so frustrating that when I have no idea how to an assignment that‚Äôs due the next day and the only really good math app out there doesn‚Äôt have it at all. So to the developers please please please update this app to have many more things with trigonometry and calculus.	positive

3273	467329677	education	5	Since moving to online classes, it has been much more difficult to ask professors for extra help. If I‚Äôm ever not sure about an answer on any type of math homework, Mathway will let me know immediately what the answer is so that I can check my answer and my method of getting said answer. It calculates basically any aspect of an equation you could be looking for, including graphs. All forms of answers are easy to find within the selection menu. Regarding my online math class, this app basically saved my life.	positive
3274	467329677	education	5	This app is the best Math help I've ever gotten, it helps me to check my answer and shows the steps I should take to solve the problem. I can select what it needs to solve such as finding the LCD, simplifying, etc. There is an option to get premium in order to see all the steps, but for about $39 a year, I'd say that's a good deal! I've tried lots of other math apps, but this one is always able to find the right answer and shows how it got, unlike the other apps where they couldn't always find the answer. No tutoring needed!	positive
3275	467329677	education	4	"I cannot recommend this app enough!!!
Yes I‚Äôve has troubles, but I‚Äôm using it for free.. I‚Äôm a broke college student so paying for a subscription is not happening, but it will allow you to use it for free without the steps. Which for me is perfectly fine as I just need the answers for my homework online! Sometimes I struggle getting the right answer but you have to play around and sometimes type half the question & key words for it to give the correct answer. Just try it out before you get aggravated! I promise it works! Helps me every week with my homework problems."	positive
3276	467329677	education	1	It is my fault but I did pay $80 for a year subscription. It had a good rating and with the price I thought it would really work. It freezes up on me I can‚Äôt even use it. If you‚Äôre in the wrong math type it won‚Äôt help you with other types of math say I‚Äôm in trigonometry section and I need help with something like algebra i have to constantly change sections rather them just redirecting me to where I need to go. I literally can‚Äôt use it bc it‚Äôs frozen now even though I completely closed the app and restarted it. There is no real big difference from the free version so don‚Äôt buy it. Yes it walks you through steps but kinda skips around so you don‚Äôt get a real big grasp on what you are doing. I suggest seeking help the old fashioned way before spending your money on this	positive
3277	467329677	education	3	"I‚Äôve been using this app for years to help me from algebra to calculus 3 and differential equations. Up until calculus 1 (derivatives) this app shined most of the time. About half the problems in calculus 2 it can‚Äôt solve which is a real bummer. I mean that‚Äôs when this app would be extremely useful since their tough problems. 

As an engineering major in a tough polytechnic college, I rely heavily on this app either on checking my answers if correct or learning how to do a problem. I would really love for this app to be better (able to do high level calculus) since the UI I believe is great. There‚Äôs room for improvement."	positive
3278	467329677	education	4	"I‚Äôll let all the other 5 star apps do the talking, this app is phenomenal. I don‚Äôt know how this app does what it does, but it has an answer to every question thus far in the Algebra class I‚Äôm currently taking. There is in an insanely detailed step by step which has helped me tremendously in learning the material I need.

My one critique is that the app doesn‚Äôt have horizontal mode on iPad (I will update this app to 5 stars if this is fixed ;D ). I‚Äôm currently using the website because of this, but I would prefer to use the app in the future once this is added."	positive
3279	467329677	education	5	This app is a legit lifesaver. I was stuck on an algebra packet and I did not know what to do. I tried using browser and other calculators but they either weren‚Äôt quick or they did not work. Which is when I found this app. I installed the app and I don‚Äôt regret it, I got the first page done using the app and I started understanding my homework more and more. The best part is, you can take a picture of the question, you don‚Äôt even have to type it which is Great! I love this app, and so will you.	positive
3280	467329677	education	3	I was only able to get one free step by step when I first tried it for free and then it kept on asking me to eight sign up or buy all the time. It was helpful to me when it came to studying. I could only get answers after that first try, bit it made me work harder to understand my math questions that did not have the same answer. Sometimes, the math answers if gave me were different to the ones that were provided to me, especially from a school book. I think if you'd do buy, then you might get more out of this app. Than those, like me, who just wanted or needed it for free help. It has its good and bad drawbacks.	positive
3281	467329677	education	4	My algebra 2 teacher is, honestly, not the best at teaching us how work out the problems. He just puts the answer to the problem on the board and doesn‚Äôt work it out. Anyway, this app has taught me how to work out so many problems using the premium version. The only reason I gave this app 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the premium price; it‚Äôs a little bit high for my liking. However, this app has allowed me to pass my class with an A and an understanding of the topics covered in algebra 2. Would recommend to anyone who is struggling in any math class.	negative
3282	467329677	education	5	Normally I do not write reviews for apps, but I just had to. This app will solve any problem accurately! It is free, but if you want to see the breakdown of the problems so you can actually learn what is going on then you need to pay for it. I went ahead and paid for a year, which is something I never do, just because this app is so awesome and it has really helped me with my college homework. It goes into the smallest detail on how to solve a problem, step by step it shows you exactly what to do. Simply amazing!	positive
3283	467329677	education	5	This app has saved my life countless times. It gets every single problem correct and i‚Äôve had 0 issues. although one thing i would change would be the cost of having to pay for the steps that correspond with the problem. i ended up paying because of how helpful it was, but i would rather there be ads than having to pay for a subscription. otherwise, it‚Äôs an amazing show stopping app that has helped me. 10/10 would recommend.	positive
3284	467329677	education	1	I‚Äôve used this app for years, now being as I‚Äôm a college student, I don‚Äôt have time to be interrupted with ads when I‚Äôm trying to do my calculus homework. EVERY TIME I put in a question before I can get the answer I‚Äôm shown an add that I have to wait 10 seconds to even be able to skip over. This attempt at money grabbing by showing people stupid ads while trying to solve math problems is pathetic and stupid. If I had just downloaded this app and that happened I‚Äôd immediately exit and delete it as it‚Äôs tacky and shows poor quality. I don‚Äôt have use for something that‚Äôs not even going to show me how to get the answer and also wastes my time with meaningless ads when I‚Äôm trying to get an education.	negative
3285	467329677	education	5	To start off, I never write reviews on applications. But this app has given me a mood to do so because of how happy it makes me. This application is excellent with the camera AI, the variety of sections of math to choose from, and the super quick response time to questions. I‚Äôve used this app for a long time and it has saved me so much time for homework and test practice. I highly recommend this application if you‚Äôre looking for something to help on math homework. 10/10	positive
3286	467329677	education	5	This app will save you if you are struggling with Algebra. I will easily ace my class and I owe it all to this technology. I could not be more impressed. I wish there were more apps like this out there that are as reliable and advanced. You don‚Äôt have to purchase the monthly subscription for it to be worth it, but after using it for about a couple of weeks I did and it‚Äôs worth every penny. I am not the type of person to even write a review, but I was overly impressed and had to.	positive
3287	467329677	education	5	Ya'll I don't have much to say except for GET THIS APP. I'm in High School and I got this app in Middle School, it helped me with algebra so much. It continues to help me today. Seriously, you can just snap a picture and BOOM, it'll give you a simplified answer (and you can choose how you want to solve it)! You can also write out problems and there are many things you can do besides algebra, such as calculus. One of the best things I've ever downloaded on my phone, please give this a shot, everyone. I love it <3	positive
3288	467329677	education	5	Overall great app for checking your work, monthly subscription is worth it. However I do most of my homework online and on an iPad it would be great to use the app in landscape mode so I can use my keyboard. Also I think a nifty feature would be to have it function like picture in picture. So you can work on homework and check your work without having to switch between app screens. (Kinda like how Netflix does there)	positive
3289	467329677	education	4	It‚Äôs the best calculator app I‚Äôve found, it has some really small issues like a tiny bit of trouble tapping around. It also has ads which I know they need to be able to make a profit and they‚Äôre normally like 30 seconds but you can skip in like 6 and they don‚Äôt interrupt work because they only appear a couple seconds after you get the solution so I would‚Äôve given a 4.5 because the only problem is very small and is tapping on stuff like fraction boxes. (Sorry for the semi-rant)	positive
3290	467329677	education	4	I was really rooting for this app and sharing it to many, but now they have a premium option and I can no longer see the work for each solution unless I pay. I understand you guys need to make money in someway but I rather have little ads pop up in the corner of my screen than pay 10$ a month for something I won‚Äôt use regularly. Other then that great app!!! Defiantly recommend for all math problems, even gives you multiple solutions like graphs, find x, y, what equation is equivalent, etc...!! üëçüèºüëçüèº	positive
3291	467329677	education	1	I‚Äôm so disappointed in this app I cant even speak on it. I got the app to help with my math homework. It didn‚Äôt help. If you need help with a word problem, don‚Äôt get this app. I first tried it with a problem that I had already done, it asked how solve the problem and I was honestly confused. If you‚Äôre helping me with the problem, then how do you not know how to help me? It‚Äôs mind boggling! I thought maybe it‚Äôs because the question was very complex and there were multiple ways to solve it. I then tried it with the question I downloaded the app for. I SCREAMED when it basked me how to solve the problem. I‚Äôm supposed to be the one that doesn‚Äôt know how to solve the problem, not you! That‚Äôs why I got the damned thing!	negative
3292	467329677	education	1	"Every time it says that it can't find any math. I took 30 pictures and it said the same thing over and over, but when I took a picture with the website I got the answer instantly.

If you're reading this, use the website mathway, but not the garbage app. Even photomath is better than than this app, and that app was so bad that my teachers talked about it to try and prevent people from cheating. The website is perfect when you ignore the ads. This app had no effort go into it and the website had all of the effort go into it.

Loser developers just want people to watch ads so badly that they let people think that they can just pull out an app to do a quick problem, then lead them away from the app and to the website when they are in a situation where they have to solve it but can't with the app.

I hate mathway because of the developers, but it works on the website so I use it. If there's a better alternative then I would be using that and so should you, so keep your eyes open."	negative
3293	467329677	education	5	This app has helped me for 3 years of math homework from pre-algebra to geometry and even though it cost a lot I would say it‚Äôs worth every penny. I wish they would come out with Something where I can pay my money al in one instead of paying money monthly. (It is free if you don‚Äôt care about showing your work but if any one is doing this for actual math help I recommend getting the better because it helps a lot) Thank you Mathway!	positive

You can just put your equation in and it gives you the answer but you can also look at how to do the problem so I think that‚Äôs pretty cool ü•∞üòä	positive
3295	467329677	education	5	If it weren‚Äôt for this app my grade probably would have dropped so low that I would be forcefully removed from the education system as a whole and swayed into sex work or fast food service. The 9.99 a month is a steep price tag for the steps and tutoring but it‚Äôs worth it seeing as I left algebra 3 honors with a 92 and now I can help my little sister with her algebra 1, when I would have been as useful as a doctor‚Äôs visit for the stomach flu without the app.	positive
3296	467329677	education	5	This is really helpful when you need to check your answers and see what you did wrong or write, a real life saver for me. One thing I wish they would do for the iPad version is allow it to be in split screen mode and also be available in landscape mode. This would make it a lot easier to type in longer problems, instead of having to switch between two apps constantly.	positive
3297	467329677	education	5	Thank you for helping me understand this algebra stuffs.  This is a wonderful program. I had algebra 30 years ago and now I‚Äôm taking classes to finish my degree and algebra is my requirement class for me to achieve my degree.  I hate it this class with a passion because I don‚Äôt understand it.  I can do adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing with my eyes closed and now I have to solve and trying to understand composition of functions I have no clue. Algebra driving me NUTS!!!	positive
3298	467329677	education	5	The app is fantastic, from its easy layout to its reliable answers, but there‚Äôs one big problem. You can‚Äôt copy/paste! Being able to do this would be incredibly helpful, since I have much of my homework online and often need to see the steps. It‚Äôs much faster to paste an equation then type it all out, and sometimes I need to finish in a hurry. However, everything else is amazing, keep up the good work :)	positive
3299	467329677	education	1	I paid for the premium because it said ‚Äútap to see steps‚Äù I did and it said I needed premium, I paid for a month and then it didn‚Äôt even give me the solution, only steps but didn‚Äôt apply it to my problem. I could have just gotten that information online for free. If anyone is wondering, I was trying to get help with statistics. Oh and then I tried getting the next step because there‚Äôs many steps to the problem and it said it couldn‚Äôt provide an answer. So again, waste of money!!! I‚Äôm so upset for actually believing this was going to work. Way too easy. But if you want an app to help you figure out what 1 + 1 is well you have a winner.	positive
3300	467329677	education	1	"Trying to use the app and website to find solutions to chemistry problems. For example one item shown in the example is the ability to enter an element or molecule and have the application find a solution for the electron configuration. So if for example you put in ‚ÄúZn‚Äù for zinc and want to find the electron configuration, the solution menu only prompts with math solutions, even though you are in the chemistry section. I don‚Äôt want to solve for Z or find the first or second derivative. Those are math solutions, not chemistry solutions. 

When you open a problem ticket they have only 2 responses. 1.  Please send us what you are doing so they claim to help. They do not help, and I have submitted many examples of trying to find chemistry solutions, not math solutions. 2.

About 1/3 of the time when I answer a student question or add a follow up comment on iOS, when I click the check mark to submit the answer or follow up, the iOS app now kicks me back to login and forces me to enter my password again, completely erasing the answer text I entered in the process.

3302	453142230	education	3	Piazza is a fantastic resource in all of my classes, but I have been disappointed by the mobile app. Instructor answers to follow up questions are not highlighted, the editor for creating a new question/ responding to a question is very clunky and lacks nearly all of the formatting options provided on desktop, and the overarching interface feels more like a half-baked mobile website than a dedicated app. Really hoping this is updated and improved at some point.	positive

I do like the little badges and icons, and it shows you how many unread comments there are for each thread. That‚Äôs really cool and very useful! There are a couple things that make it really frustrating though. 

Notifications: when you receive one, like a comment on a thread, you might expect it to take it to you to that thread, scroll to the appropriate comment and maybe even highlight it. But at best it takes you to the thread. Now if it‚Äôs a long thread with many comments, you have no idea where in the thread the new comment is. That makes it practically useless because I‚Äôm never going to find what was just said. That comment could be at the end (if you‚Äôre lucky) or a response somewhere in the middle ... who knows. Also, if you already have the app open and you get a new notification and open it, the app just opens. It doesn‚Äôt even take you to he thread ... so pretty useless :(

Images: Whenever there is an image on the screen, it‚Äôs difficult to scroll past it. The screen ‚Äúbounces‚Äù and won‚Äôt let you scroll if you try and swipe the screen up or down and you touch the image. I‚Äôve found the work around is to touch the very edge of the screen so you can grab some part that‚Äôs not the image. But sometimes you just can‚Äôt figure out why it won‚Äôt scroll, not realizing there is an image in there. 

If they just fixed the notifications, I‚Äôd be really happy. I can deal with the image thing. The notifications are my main source of frustration and one of the things that could make this app really useful."	positive

3336	453142230	education	1	"The latest update unnecessarily harder to use than before. Before the layout was very similar to the website with each section clearly marked and the default page being the classes page. When I'm signed up for several different classes that use piazza, there are tens of erroneous posts made per hour so the activity feed is usually too frustrating to sort through to be useful. It would be nice to choose which page is your starting page. Also, on the individual class pages, pinned posts vs regular posts are as clearly separated as they were before. I have to look a lot harder to skip over the pinned posts I've seen a hundred times and find the new posts I'm actually looking for. Overall a big step backward in terms of functionality with the latest update.

Update: search functionality just breaks the app now.."	positive
3337	453142230	education	1	Please update the app and include screen optimization for the iPhone 5. I figured since so many people have to use this every day for collegiate academics it would be much more up-to-date and user-friendly. Can you guys please just have it work where the I can just click on a respond button under a student's question? Instead of a bunch of weird options can you guys just put a respond, and +photo, button under each question and response? Please fix these problems so I can actually use this on my phone instead of constantly having to pull my laptop out to check all of the questions and still be confused. Until then, this app really only deserves two stars because I can read the question and see the responses.	positive
3338	453142230	education	4	"Thanks for creating this app! It makes it easier to access piazza without using a computer.

I wish that there was a search option available like on the website itself. I also wish that my location when scrolling through posts doesn't reset to the favorites section after favoriting a post. I lose my progress going through the posts and it's a bit inconvenient to scroll down again and look for where I was last at."	positive
3339	453142230	education	1	Please go back to the old version from last year. The new activity view is awful if you have a very large class as there is always constant activity. But, finding the typical class Q&A view is sometimes a pain and you must do it everytime you open the app as it always opens to the activity view. Also, it is quite buggy. I have had multiple times where I type the response as an instructor to only have it not be saved. Piazza is supposed to make it easier, but this version of the app is actually making it harder. Please fix. Until then, I guess I will be logging on to the website on my phone.	negative
3340	453142230	education	3	"While I enjoy the new iOS 7/8 redesign, functionality is pretty weak. You cannot hide old classes without deleting them in the default ""all activity"" tab. Navigating is quick, but somehow not very intuitive. Definitely not a substitute for the desktop web app, but will work in a pinch.
I guess I just wish the app worked more like an email app with folders for each class, and intuitive navigating.
Overall: nice looking and usable, but needs improvement to be able to replace the desktop web app."	positive
3341	453142230	education	3	"Issues I've run into:
Sometimes the text box just disappears when I'm editing a comment, so that I can't edit the text anymore unless I start over again, leaving me with the dilemma of either deleting everything or submitting my half-baked reply. This usually happens after I change settings for the post. 

I don't think anyone in their right mind will go through the painful steps of copying everything into the clipboard, just in case the app suddenly goes bonkers."	negative
3342	453142230	education	1	My class uses Piazza for discussions as well as homework. When I try to log onto Piazza on safari, it redirects to the app. The app doesn't show the posted resources, which includes our homework. PLEASE allow a way to access the resources section either from the app or from the website on safari. I use my iPad as my main computer for school, and now I can't even access my homework without a normal computer. This makes life EXTREMELY difficult, with no apparent purpose except to promote the app. Fix this and you've got a 5 instead of a 1	positive
3343	453142230	education	3	"As a student, it helps a lot, especially because most of the work we do is learned at home. I hate the new update because you can't post a picture at a student answer. My class uses this solely to get extra credit, but if you look at it in an altruistic perspective (like my teacher) it helps the class to clarify over topics. The reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because of the update.

3344	453142230	education	1	If you are a professor, please do not force your students to use this product. Piazza has created a public account for me without my knowledge!!!! Also it automatically sends you notifications every 4 hours for each class you are enrolled in. Shady piazza team also made it complicated to change this setting, despite the fact that every email reminds students that they may change it. The site is not mobile friendly.	positive
3345	453142230	education	3	The app is a faster alternative than accessing thru web.  However, it does not have all the features that the web has like access data, etc.  However now when I want to access piazza via web it gets automatically redirected to the app. Even if I remove the app, it wants to install the app.  Someone has to work on this bug soon.	positive
3346	453142230	education	2	Since the Piazza web site doesn't work properly on an iPhone, I'm excited at the prospect of being able to access Piazza through an iPhone app. But unfortunately, the app isn't quite there yet. It's probably fine for students with young eyes and excellent eyesight - but for us professors wearing bifocals, the app's font size is too small to be readable, and the app provides no way to enlarge it. I hope they can fix that soon!	positive
3347	453142230	education	3	"The new version of this app is pretty, but is more unstable than ever, and seems to still be out of sync from the standard web app, at least in terms of functionality.

It's great to be able to get push notifications, but that's all this app is consistently great for.

Piazza, why not open up an API so we can develop the proper iOS client?"	positive
3348	453142230	education	4	I use this app a lot with my students and haven't ever had any problems until the last update. I am now unable to use Piazza on my ipad, the app doesn't allow me to sign in. Please offer a solution. I have deleted and reinstalled the app however the problem still exists.	negative
3349	453142230	education	5	Works just fine, and it's way better than trying to use the desktop site on a mobile device. Piazza's layout matches very well with the app design, and it's both intuitive and aesthetically pleasing.	positive
3350	453142230	education	3	The recent update fixed some bugs but I just caught another one where every time I go back from a piazza post, it will take Me to the top of all the threads instead of where I was reading. I had to scroll down every time to get back to where I was. Please fix.	positive
3351	1161035371	lifestyle	4	I pray many times a day but sometimes it is a short prayer requesting something of the Lord or just thanking him for something He has blessed me with or an answered prayer. I longed for a closer relationship and more true communication during my prayer times. The Pray App has helped me accomplish and establish the habit of praying daily in a manner that helps me to be more thoughtful with my prayers and talks with the Lord. The scripture helps me to truly think about the meaning of the verse and to apply it within my life and prayers. Thank you so much.   I wish when it counts the days you use the lap it was more consistent. For instant I have an irregular schedule due to my husbands shift work. I have been using the app daily but because the hours vary it doesn‚Äôt recognize that I have been on it daily but seems to think I have missed a day here and there. I understand because of the irregular schedule sometimes it‚Äôs slightly over an actual 24 hour time span so for this program the timer will start over.  God knows and understands and it‚Äôs not a big deal.	positive

Since day 1 of downloading this app I have put my prayers in this community almost daily and feel so much love and support by all of the people who also enjoy Pray.

Change header picture 

Where you have the feed of thank yous, show each person only once or only 1 thank you button can show up within an hour from a person. 

I just want to thank for the prayer, not their comment too 

Have a separate like button and prayer button: I feel like some people just scroll and like every and to the person it looks like they prayed for them. 

Try to become more like Instagram but then this app is special because you can anonymously send out prayers and other people will pray for you. It‚Äôs nice getting prayed for by distant people because I feel like I can be more open. 

You should do a poll to see if people actually want their friends to be on the app or if they like it being people that they don‚Äôt know them. 

You have a whole section to get people to add their friends but the fake notification is annoying and cheapens the app. You need some new marketing techniques. You could pay famous Christian Instagram accounts to promote your app.

This app basically forces a 7 day trial and then charges you $50 which is the cheapest subscription they have all the way up to $180. My church takes the money we give and does amazing things with it. This app on the other hand, charges you to hear bible stories and other stuff. You guys could of made things a little more affordable instead of praying on the innocent. God sees all. Remember that. If your range was $20 - $50 I wouldn‚Äôt of said a thing. What in the world are you doing with all this money, because there‚Äôs no way that it cost that much to keep the app running. Also, why do you need our phone number just to enter the app! Never seen that before. Very greedy and using the Lord to make money. Not cool.	positive

Not only does it give you the scripture, the prayer that follows the scripture helps me to better understand what I‚Äôve heard and read so much better. 

There‚Äôs so much more to say about the Pray App, but I‚Äôll just say it this way -  I‚Äôm wonderfully hooked! This was well thought through, and it was developed especially for people like me as I like listening over and over and over again. It‚Äôs absolutely marvelous, and it makes me joyfully happy. If there are any bugs I don‚Äôt know it because I‚Äôm not that savvy. All I know is this works for me.

3357	1161035371	lifestyle	3	Typically, when there is a fee to use an app there is an ‚Äúin app purchase‚Äù notice posted that a user can use to help them make a decision about whether or not they want to download the app. This app does not, although the download only allows you a week of their advertised bedtime stories before you have to start paying for them. And then, there is a weird count-down timer that gives you about two-and-a-half minutes until the purchase ‚Äúoffer‚Äù ends. However, if you click out of that page and go back in, the timer starts over again. I understand they need to pay for all the bells and whistles, but that should be made clear, without pressure, before download. As a free alternative, I suggest the Bible app, which has audio of every bible translation for free.	positive

You do however, have to pay $7.99 a month to have access to music, mediations, bedtime stories, and more. I think that $7.99 is honestly a bargain for all of that Pray offers. Even if you decide not to have the subscription, you have accessibility to the basics. You can get daily bible quotes, regardless whether you decide to have a subscription or not.

I agree with another reviewer that the Bible itself should be free. For anyone wanting to read the Bible, check out the free Bible app from You Version with the Holy Bible icon- it‚Äôs free and fabulous. I understand this is a business, but for the goal of sharing the word of God (possibly with non-believers), please consider making the Bible itself free and a few of each of the different features free.

 There was no one to get in touch with to cancel and no number to call. It was an a annoying experience. And I think that you need to fix that. You also never put how much that you were going to charge me for your services. You were wrong in so many areas and you need to fix it. And how dare you try to do it to my contacts m. I definitely told them about my experience and that deterred them from joining. I was so happy. Because they didn‚Äôt also need to be deceived.

I can find specific needs and prayer brings me the partners to accomplish my goals. When I feel and express gratitude more blessings seem to flow.
Sometimes I am overwhelmed by my blessings. That‚Äôs the time to take a deep breath, get on my knees, and say Thank You Jesus. Thank you God.

3386	1161035371	lifestyle	2	I love the entire concept of this app but once I downloaded it everything was locked unless I signed up for the free trial. I only have access to one prayer but none of the content. It would be a good idea to allow us to listen to a few of the items to get a feel for the app and if we want to commit to signing up. I have no problem paying for an app I find useful (and this one looks awesome!) without first signing up for a free seven day trial. Other apps that are similar unlock some content  so we can get a handle on if we want the commitment or not. Instead, when apps do this, I just delete the app from my phone.	positive

That‚Äôs not the same as prayer, and I don‚Äôt want to pretend it is. I would like for the app to pull the daily prayers for my community of Southeastern University from a source that is only real prayers and Scriptures.

But I had very limited access without paying for a subscription. This seems unnecessary. It‚Äôs the word of God. Should it not be free to those who want to hear it? Or if you have to charge, make it a one-time purchase for download. The holy bible app is free so that it can reach thousands of people. Craig Groechel created for the purpose of being able to spread the word at no cost. This should be so for all apps like this.

Some are simple collections of brain twister games to try and help you memorize patterns on a grid, or pick the red word that actually reads blue... But what I appreciate about Elevate is that it challenges you with real world problems. Practice your ability to calculate percentages. It‚Äôll come in handy next time you‚Äôre calculating your dinner tip, or figuring out how much you‚Äôll save during a clothing sale. Elevate helps your to improve your writing skills and comprehension. Get better at spotting typos in your emails and texts. Quickly skim messages while reliably gathering what‚Äôs being communicated. There are so many games provided by Elevate which challenge your real-world skills, and push you to improve in areas that affect your day to day. There are free features, but thank goodness I bought a lifetime membership early on in Elevate‚Äôs life. I couldn‚Äôt have guessed I‚Äôd still love the app so many years later.

If you want to get better at day to day tasks, and push yourself to your highest intellectual abilities, Elevate is a great app for you. I personally feel the benefits of using this app, and find myself returning to this app when I‚Äôm feeling less on top of things. Give your brain that much needed mental stretch.

Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better app to train and sharpen my brain through. Even if you only have a few minutes a day it‚Äôs enough to fit training in (recommendation is 12 mins. minimum I believe).

The subscription costs hardly anything for everything you get out of this app all the way down to stats updating you on your progress and where you need work. My favorite is the notification center which includes updates on sessions you had trouble in, and they go back over them with you to explain in detail where you messed up and why the correct answer is the correct answer. Not to mention the fact that the games on this are far more professional than most popular ‚Äúbrain game‚Äù apps on the market. I‚Äôve tried a handful of others and they all just seem too light and playful in approach whereas Elevate has what feels like a professional and serious approach. I feel like I‚Äôm getting proper lessons and training rather than ‚Äújust playing some games‚Äù. So glad I found Elevate; it‚Äôs worth the download even if you opt out of subscribing."	positive
3403	875063456	education	4	I first liked the app and tried the free version for some time. I liked the regular practice and decided to purchase when there was a big sale. However I feel once I have purchased that I don‚Äôt get any more benefits than I did with the free version. The games aren‚Äôt that much more diverse.. it tends to pick the same games for me continually and rarely do I get new ones. I feel there are some features that make the practice feel less like it‚Äôs trying to train you, teach you, help understand things better, and more focused on completing the game and passing. For instance there are some games that don‚Äôt tell me what the correct answer should have been if I got it wrong. Or if you run out of time, I would like to know the answer to what I was working on. Sometimes if I do not pass on the first try, the second try is much easier or doesn‚Äôt seem equivalent levels, just so that I pass instead of being challenged. Some games have such a time pressure that your mind can make shortcuts just to guess the right answer instead of knowing why it‚Äôs correct. The reviews only will go over 2 mistakes... Yea. I feel there could be more to make a paying contributor feel like they get more out of the training	positive
3404	875063456	education	5	As an engineering student, I can attest to many a long research paper, and timed physics and calculus exams. Often in the solving of complex thermodynamics, you would find that some of the most annoying, time consuming operations could be alleviated by a stronger, faster mental math skill set. I have spent entire nights (without sleeping) poring over long research papers, attempting to catch mistakes and condense and clarify my work. These games are very basic, fun, and effective. I feel that this app has the potential for further development, and could easily become part of the tool set of an aspiring engineer. They speed train the basics, so that you have more time and energy to focus on the tough stuff. I'm a bit intrigued by how the ratings are calculated, as I reached the 80% percentile in math within my 3rd day of using it. Do you guys think to account for the people who get the app, play for one day and then never use it again? Or maybe I'm just smart. Idk. Great app to try for the free trial, not sure if I'll pay for it though. I'll be keeping my eye on its development for sure though	positive
3405	875063456	education	4	"I‚Äôve used this app for a long time and maxed out almost every category until they raised the max to over 300. Something that has always bothered me is the points accrued. I don‚Äôt see much rhyme or reason to it sometimes. For example, at times I see it shoot up four points on an Excellent score, but other times it is raised by only three. The app in the past would give five points but that seems to have gone by the wayside some time ago. 
My main issue is when you get a high score. I have only seen it move up by three measly points for high scores for a long time now. A high score should net more points than anything else. It doesn‚Äôt happen often and if you can beat your previous high score, isn‚Äôt that the pinnacle? It‚Äôs better than excellent, obviously. It should garner five points. It should be the only time you can earn that much. Right now it is only three! That is ridiculous, please update the point system and give more points for a high score, and maybe amend the point system in general to make it more obvious about why you are getting what you get. Thank you."	positive

But dang, (am not going to curse), this application so far is incredible! It is so practical and useful to daily life, honestly this type of format should be used in the public school systems. It is engaging, looks beautiful and clean, and has great motivating features such as the slot-machine sounds(which if you have been to vegas feel pretty rewarding lol). Overall this has to be one of the best applications i have used to date, which makes the yearly payment absolutely worth it if you find developing your mind in practical way useful. 9.9/10 so far.

Also for you guys that have read all the way till the end, wait for the ‚Äúcheaper algorithm‚Äù to kick in. (Not sure what needs to be done, but diminishing use, sucking more, skipped lessons, non-finished days as time goes on, but continual use without upgrading may be the key)

3407	875063456	education	4	I‚Äôve learned a lot from these brain exercises. I‚Äôm less intimidated by math and have learned some new vocabulary words. However, some of the exercises are unnecessarily repetitive. For example, I‚Äôve been tested on the exact same stories a few times. And some of the pictures for vocabulary building are too difficult to see on a smart phone or the pictures don‚Äôt adequately portray what they are supposed to picture. In other words, sometimes the pictures reflect a biased perspective that, I suspect, makes the game inadequate for gaging the performance of a large segment of its players. Other problems occur in games that test our ability to hear mistakes in grammar. These recordings sometimes don‚Äôt take into account that a listener might easily hear a correct version even if it‚Äôs not said correctly by the speaker. The voice and rhythm and flow of the recorded speakers tend to be culturally tinged in a way that this company has considered adequately generic enough but this might not be valid to account for some of the wide ranging nuances and speech patterns that flavor the language centers in the brains of lots of listeners.	negative

It‚Äôs hard to attest (even on a scientific level) whether it makes you more intelligent or not, but it definitely helps you understand and be more conscious, concise and articulated with language; it also helps you understand how your own mind memorizes or focuses best, and learn techniques for quick mathematical processing. After using this app (on and off I must admit) for the last two years, I‚Äôve found I‚Äôm more assertive at choosing my words and learning new ones without having to look them up in a dictionary (thanks to etymologies,) be more present when listening to a process or people‚Äôs names, and have also became really good at quick math calculations which come really handy for business casual conversations.

Over my life I‚Äôve tapped to play several learning-style games, everything from sudoku and crosswords to luminosity brain trainers and word games. Every one of them bored me, if I am being completely honest. Luminosity came close but it just wasn‚Äôt stimulating enough for me to make it a habit. Enter ‚ÄúElevate‚Äù. I am finishing up my two week trial and this is the first time I‚Äôve maintained a consistent practice for as long as I have. The games are challenging, but in a way that makes me more excited to keep playing, not less. It gives you games that practice seriously practical knowledge and processing skills, and even better, they use real world information in all of their written word games so you‚Äôre double learning. I feel like I‚Äôm finally tackling my biggest challenge (processing speed) while also leveling up skills I already felt pretty confident in. Ten of ten would recommend.	positive

A favorite celebrity of mine (Madelaine Pestch) mentioned this in an interview that she did, and I got curious about it because it sounded interesting. It has helped improve my brain power in a fun way. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm a actually doing work, and at the same time I can get my daily dose of learning on weekends and breaks. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is the fact you need to pay money to get certain things. I understand that the creators need to make money somehow, but I really wish I could do those two pro levels. I‚Äôm going to try the free trial and let you know what I think of it. Anyways, I know the app couldn‚Äôt really change the money part, so...yeah. Thanks for creating the app, though! It‚Äôs highly recommended for anyone who feels like they need a little freshening up in the brain every once in awhile, especially if you have money to spare, because it‚Äôs really not that much money if you want to do the pro (40 bucks a year).

3414	875063456	education	2	"I love it, except for there seems to be missing the Listening section which is shown in my iPhone widget section, which I would find really helpful.
 As was stated elsewhere, once you get to higher difficulty it still keeps the scores from when it was super easy, so you can only do ‚Äúgood‚Äù, can only proceed by 1 (up to 400, when it gets extremely difficult around 200) and never ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù, which is painstaking and poor design. Perhaps they are only marketing it for people who only use it for two weeks then quit? (Perhaps because the trial period doesn‚Äôt last that long). Cheap gimmick to make people cough up $9, which no app costs that much. 
 I am quickly losing patience with what I thought was a game-changer, or ‚Äúbrain-changer‚Äù, but poor design makes it bog down quick, especially as it seems that after only 2 weeks I‚Äôm in the 92nd percentile in everything but math, where I‚Äôm almost to 98th percentile. This is indicative that people lose interest quick because of the poor level progression. 
 I‚Äôm really bummed :(
Developers: get it together!"	negative
3415	875063456	education	3	"I‚Äôm a fan of this app, and I just subscribed for the second year. I wasn‚Äôt planning on it, though, because as I progressed through the levels, I found the scoring system significantly lacking. What really annoys me about it is that as you progress, there‚Äôs no recognition for the increased difficulty. Meaning, I can get my high score in a game the first time I play it because it‚Äôs so easy, but it‚Äôs scored the EXACT SAME WAY when the stakes are raised! The difficulty setting is way way higher, so it‚Äôs virtually impossible to achieve a high score in any game beyond the beginning stages of playing it. You‚Äôre forever getting your 5th or 6th highest score, or worse, because the game is that much more difficult now. It ends up taking all the fun out playing, and is why I took like an 8 month break. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I enjoy the games and do find them challenging, but it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating to get a high score when the difficulty setting is at Beginner and NEVER be able to touch it again! If they fix that, this app would be amazing!"	positive
3416	875063456	education	3	A great challenge and a good way to learn new stuff. If I could just point something out the reading section is good each reading segment is easy to do quickly and thus not daunting, but problem one is the comprehension test is multiple choice, which is a quite easy thing to trick (even accidentally) as each is a 3 choice question ‚Äî super easy to guess on and to trick into thinking I did better than I actually did. Making me fill in the answer or just offering more options would make it more realistic, as then it would be harder or impossible to guess the right answer. Also maybe I haven‚Äôt found it yet, but I would like a vocab trainer option like a flash card section. Not just a couple games that are a test of what I already know, but away to practice the new words I keep finding on this app, I mean that‚Äôs how I learn new words (by repetition and usage through context) not just seeing it once on a test and hoping I‚Äôll remember. I mean I could find a vocab app but then why do I need you?	positive

Been using Elevate Pro for about 3 years, and have noticed remarkable improvements in my writing and communication skills. Happy to say my writing skills have improved, even beyond the level they were at in college. That's mostly due to daily use of Elevate, though I keep looking for excuses to write, thanks to my greater enjoyment of such. My mental math skills have benefitted as well. 

The app is a pleasure to use, and the development behind it is exceptional. The training exercises are interesting, and enjoyable, and you can quickly sense your improvement. I've learned so much about words I knew from context, even though my understanding of their definition was off. 

I appreciate Elevate‚Äôs support, as well. Quick to respond, and helpful.

Been meaning to leave a review. Thankful I've NEVER been nagged to do so. Elevate was named APP OF THE DAY, today, so here‚Äôs my review. 

Go ahead and start with the Free version. There's a LOT to it. You can subscribe to the Pro version, whenever you feel like it. You'll gain eve more helpful exercises.

If your brain has been feeling rusty, or you just want to improve your skills, you've GOT to give it a try. Set a time to use it each day when your brain is most fresh, and make it a habit."	positive
3418	875063456	education	5	I was skeptical at first when I downloaded Elevate; I thought it would be full of cheesy games that don‚Äôt actually exercise your brain functions. I was wrong. I purchased the pro version within a week and am extremely happy with my decision. Not only are the games a blast, I have certainly noticed a difference in my daily life after using Elevate daily for about a year. My math skills are more pronounced, I recognize significantly more errors in writing, my reading speed has increased, and I‚Äôve expanded my vocabulary. In addition to Elevate‚Äôs games, it also provides a metic for your progress, the efficiency quotient. This allows you to keep track of your strengths and weaknesses. My good friend and I are both daily users, and frequently compare stats as a friendly competition. A great way to think critically and stay sharp. I highly recommend Elevate!	positive
3419	875063456	education	5	So I normally don‚Äôt write App Store reviews but I‚Äôve had depression for 2 years now & diagnosed with an autoimmune disease 3 years. Apart from all my other symptoms, memory loss was a big one! There is a lot of times I was forgetting something I just said or heard and having a lot of issues. I downloaded this app to try it out and wasn‚Äôt really expecting the amazing results I‚Äôve received. Even only partaking in this app one time a day I have been having so much improvement with not only my brain function but memories as well. For the past 2 years my brain has felt like it‚Äôs been in a dense fog with no way to get out. This app has saved my life!!! It‚Äôs done for me what doctors couldn‚Äôt. Math is still my worst subject but the app has noticed what I excel at and what I don‚Äôt and tweaks each session to stack on more knowledge from my session the day before. You will not regret this app.	positive
3420	875063456	education	5	"This was great until the update for apple x made it unusable for ios11 on my iphone 6s plus. Now i can‚Äôt even get the app to load, it just closes itself.

Update- i emailed them and they pretty promptly responded that it needs to be in standard view instead of zoomed view to work and they have already sent an update into Apple to fix. Apple has to approve. So they at least have figured out the problem quickly and care to respond to users in a timely manner. So i changed my review to 4 stars. They lost a star due to the problem and needing more offline content (i‚Äôd give them a 4.5 or even 4.9 if i could)but their customer service is great!

Update #2- They pushed the update through and even emailed to follow up so i‚Äôm again gonna change it to 5 stars because of their follow thru. Just please add more offline content."	positive
3421	875063456	education	5	I‚Äôve been trying to decrease the amount of time that I spend on social media and have used this app as a replacement behavior. I moved my social media app to my last page and moved this one front and center. The games are fun and interesting. The only suggestion I would make is to not make every game expire with a timer but rather have a set number of questions to be completed and decrease the score further based on duration.  This would allow the player to get maximum practice during that session but need for growth would still be documented based on incorrect answers and duration. The timer acts as a distraction at times and when completing lessons on things like brevity and language.  I‚Äôm not sure it is necessary as one is rarely asked to do such activities for time.  I see it‚Äôs use related to activities like mental math. Overall, great app keep up the good work.	positive
3422	875063456	education	5	I started with the free version and was hungry from more. Fortunately shortly after I had started using the app, they had a 45% off lifetime membership, I jumped on board with an offer like that. This is one of the best ‚Äúbrain exercise‚Äù apps that I‚Äôve come across. In the full version there are several different types of brain teasers within each topic. I also like the ability to have it remind you to do your days training and like that it takes less than 10 mins to complete the 5 modules. I also find it very helpful that when you get something wrong, it pops up a little helper to explain an easy way to complete the problems...it is a fun little break in the day that wakes up my mind and I find that after doing my daily session I am revitalized when I get back to work. Great app, give it a try and see if you agree...	positive
3423	875063456	education	1	I have emailed about this!  No response!  I loved this app. I am getting close to 99.9% in every category. But now every time I take a test and it gives me 2, 3 , or 4 pts, it does not add to my present score. On top of that, yesterday my score went DOWN!!!!  I paid for a year in advance. I generally love this app.  It now I am so aggravated. There is also a spot on the app where we can let you know if something is graded incorrectly. It constantly throws out ‚Äúminute‚Äù as a synonym for tiny or small. I emailed but no response. I can avoid writing minute. But I want to get all top scores!   Not giving me the scores I earn and deducting them after the fact for no reason is INFURIATING!  I just checked. The points are not adding to all categories since I got to master. When they are added, they are incomplete. For instance, if I should get 4 points, it gives me none or maybe 1. I paid for a whole year in advance. I advise those who are interested in this app to beware, or to at least pay month by month. I REGRET PAYING FOR A YEAR WHEN I AM HAVING THESE PROBLEMS AFTER ONLY 2 MONTHS!  HELPPPP!!!!	negative
3424	875063456	education	5	"I‚Äôm the type of person who‚Äôs always looking for ways to get smarter by any means possible- and that includes brain-training apps. I‚Äôve tried a few, and out of those I tried, Elevate is definitely the best one.

As some other reviews have said, the games actually work. I‚Äôve had this app for three months now, and I still play it every week. Normally I never stay addicted to an app for that long. During these three months, I‚Äôve noticed changes: being able to calculate mental math more quickly, noticing more mistakes in my writing, etc. These games are like power workouts: short but effective. And let‚Äôs not ignore the fact that there‚Äôs NO ADS and actually quite a bit of free content (three games a day, but you can replay them as much as you want). An overall truly fantastic app. Thank you Elevate."	positive
3425	875063456	education	5	"Instead of trying to increase skills like most games do, this one actually directly improves academic skills. For example, I didn‚Äôt realize that my use of commas isn‚Äôt horrible, but isn‚Äôt at the level I thought it was, which is embarrassing for the psychological educational psych reports I write. So, I‚Äôm practicing clicking where a comma should be inserted or removed (separate lessons). I‚Äôm also increasing my vocabulary by choosing synonyms. These are personal weaknesses of mine. There are a huge number of games targeting all kinds of academics.

I‚Äôm really thrilled with this app. I‚Äôve emailed the developers some recommendations and they reply quickly. Ha, I just used a brevity skill.

I do constantly download competing apps, but definitely prefer this one. Gives a good amount of free games that you can use without being forced to do a trial first like some other ones I‚Äôve downloaded (then risk begin charges if I forget to cancel). They do have a trial. 

All of the brain games are expensive, and I paid for Luminosity years ago. Which was good, but taught cognitive skills that don‚Äôt always generalize to real life use. Subscriptions for me are rare, but I bought this one. 

Definitely worth trying. Especially if you have kids with learning disabilities or who impulsively answer questions."	positive
3426	875063456	education	5	This game is great it‚Äôs well worth the forty dollars it‚Äôs great for learning around everything. It‚Äôs really informative increases reading skills and helps break down math problems. I highly recommend this game to anyone that wants to better their self. If you make errors it shows you how to fix it each game has a list of benefits that tells you what you will inherit from the game. These benefits can be brought out into our world to help us calculate quicker and speak better to people which can help us grow in jobs. I that God that I stumbled over this game and have to much to purchase the pro version to improve my self in other areas. I feel like over time it will help my ready the Bible faster and get to know Christ at a faster rate. I encourage you all to try this game out I would take my time to write this if it wasn‚Äôt good. God bless.	positive
3427	875063456	education	5	One day I decided to look for an app that would help me become stronger in reading, writing, math, spelling, diction, memory recall, focus, and et cetera and this app is by far amazing. I enjoy the training session, the subtle reminders, the areas of growth the app collects, the apps design, and user interaction. You can play multiple games to a point but you‚Äôre still learning new things and stretching your yourself. I‚Äôm not sure if the app has the data depiction of your strengths in a graphic layout like ‚ÄúPeak‚Äù does because I‚Äôm still in the trial phase of the app but my hope is that they do have it and if not the app is still amazing. I do hope the app has that display; being able to see my growth in that way makes me wanna keep utilizing the app. Elevate if you‚Äôre able to incorporate that I‚Äôm all yours lol. üëåüèæ Don‚Äôt wait, try the app you‚Äôll enjoy it!	positive
3428	875063456	education	4	"This is a great set of puzzles which unlike other brain apps focuses on word usage. Three a day although you can play specific ones, at least with the paid version. I use this three days a week, it's fast and it's nice to see progress. 
My complaint is with the last update. It mentioned additional stats added to the start of each game. In past experience that has usually meant to me how I stack up against other users. Wrong. It simply presents a page with my own game stats, which I could check already on the old version. Worse yet, it now slows down getting to each game! In the old version after you played a puzzle, it automatically went to the next one. Now you have to sit through this stats page while it loads and then hit the play button! That stinks. I recommend removing that feature next time around to speed the app up."	positive
3429	875063456	education	5	"This is unlike the other brain games I‚Äôve played before. This game is actually more like having a tutor and I‚Äôm only on the free version (I really want the paid one though). 

Unlike other brain/memory flexing games, this one tells you HOW to do what it‚Äôs suggesting, like an actual person would. Having trouble at math? Multiply the largest number by 2 and then divide by 10 to figure out division by 5 (yes I‚Äôm bad at mental division). Having trouble speed reading? The game tells you why it is difficult and what to do to get better at it too. The words feel like they are just flashing before my face with no coherency but I‚Äôm able to still give right answers. There are no distracting ads, no distracting music, and no distracting graphics. They are elegant but simple and the app itself works really well."	positive
3430	875063456	education	4	"I‚Äôm color blind. If you had a color that signified a correct an set every time that would be great. Gold for each correct answer? When it‚Äôs a different color each time I‚Äôm not sure if I got the answer correct or not. Also if I‚Äôm really not progressing on something there needs to be a remedial component. I‚Äôm advanced in writing and reading (who knew) but my math skills are floundering. I need a division course because I can‚Äôt with that game if my life depended on it. Maybe flash cards to look at after the game? Also flash cards for the words you didn‚Äôt get right so you can better understand the definition/spelling/synonyms. 

Conclusion: Correct answers need a certain color, and incorrect answers need a different color, every time in every game. The games are fun but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm learning anything if there‚Äôs no remedial work on the parts where I‚Äôm struggling."	positive
3431	875063456	education	4	The games are great. I enjoyed my two-week free trial of the pro version enough that I opted to buy a yearly subscription. I tried the free version for a few days after the trial ended, but it only gave you access to the three games per day that they chose for your training routine, which may or may not be games that you enjoy or find helpful, and it only let you play each game three times each day. The variety of games that you get with the pro subscription plus the access to study materials definitely makes it worth it. I do wish that some of the games made it easier for me to learn from my mistakes in the moment instead of having to wait for the review at the end of the week. It would also be helpful if I could use the app in both portrait and landscape mode since I use it on both my phone and my iPad.	positive
3432	875063456	education	5	I feel like Lumosity just makes you play games they don‚Äôt really power increase what my real goals are. I‚Äôd say elevate is a much better ap In the sense that it actually helps those muscle memory for math and English and as you play you can tell your actual getting better and faster. Only con to this ap is the options for payment. I think the should allow you to slowly buy the games one by one.I‚Äôve only seen 3 different payment options. And the lifetime option seems by far the best. If you plan on playing more than a month. Sadly dropping 100 bucks on the spot isn‚Äôt always the easiest for someone. So if people could slowly buy the games till they reached that level of life time pro that would be perfect for the consumer.	positive
3433	875063456	education	3	This game is pretty good. I really like how it gives you reminders that tell you to complete your training sessions and you never miss a day. I like most of the games. The have helped me with stamina, speech, and thinking. The only thing that I don‚Äôt like are the games when you have to listen. Sometimes these games are okay but other times you can‚Äôt ding a quiet place to do them. Also it is hard to remember all the details they are giving you along with the information you need to remember. I also don‚Äôt like the fact that they don‚Äôt give you many hints when you either run out of lives or you mess up on something. The main thing that I really like is how they show the levels of the games you play so you can get a sense of how hard the games are that you are about to play. Overall this game is pretty good but there is just some things that they could fix.	positive
3434	875063456	education	4	"After utilizing this app for over a month I find myself paying more attention to not only my reading, writing, and math skills, but also noting errors in the world around me.  To date, I can‚Äôt say that it has helped my memory as I still struggle with word-finding difficulty.  However, I notice I pay better attention to others‚Äô use of adjectives.  I am less likely to lazily pick up my calculator as I improve my math estimation skills.
My only complaint is that there seems to be no way to provide feedback when finding an error within the app. For example, one game asks the player to decide if a word or phrase is valid or an error. I received an error when I said the phrase ‚Äùwell read‚Äù was incorrect. It's not a big deal, but it should read, ‚Äùwell-read‚Äù.
Still worth the time I'm spending."	negative
3435	875063456	education	4	"I enjoy this app, and it is especially good for this 77 year-old who wants to avoid senior moments and worse.
My primary complaint is that the app puts too much emphasis on speed. In my lifetime of experiences, accuracy is far more critical than speed, although sometimes, only sometimes, that is not true. While I understand there must be some time control in the app, as applied presently those time controls are excessive, making speed and accuracy equal. This is a tough issue, but the creative people in charge should be able to solve the issue.
Also, as a writer and lawyer, occasionally I believe the app‚Äôs ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answer is debatable and sometimes clearly wrong, but that is probably unavoidable when using the English Language.
Overall, worth the money and the only app of its high caliber."	positive
3436	875063456	education	3	"I am an 84-year-old retired man living in an assisted living facility. My reactions are fast but my fingers are shaky and the keyboard on my little iPhone 6s is tiny. Many correct answers and speed bonuses Are functions of the size of the keyboard i.e. ,the size of the cell phone, And or shakiness of the hand of the participant, and I can name several other variables similarly age-related. 

And the ones where you have to tap on small boxes on the bottom to raise or lower the amount you want, I find myself getting all the correct answers yet unable to direct my finger to the small boxes. It‚Äôs easier to press a large rectangle with the correct answer possibilities then to work with those tiny boxes, especially for one my age.

For the same reasons I am dictating this using Siri and I think I‚Äôve caught most of our mistakes but not all of them. Please excuse any egregious errors meir34"	positive
3437	875063456	education	5	"Still think this is a great app, but is possible to add a phonics game of some sort. I know a lot of adult struggle with reading and spelling and think this would really help.

There are many Brain games out there, but this one by far is the most superior to me. Not only does it have games to help increase your skills, but they have interesting subjects to learn about. I often find myself paying more attention because the article during the game was so good. Plus they give tips for you to become better at the game. Thanks to the people at elevate I‚Äôm way better at calculating percentages. Still haven‚Äôt got the subtraction tip.....but maybe it click one day.

Thanks again to all the people who work on the app. I appreciate your dedication."	positive
3438	875063456	education	5	"This is the best brain training app I have found - and I have only used the free version! With its real world problems ranging from common mental calculations, to proper grammar and punctuation, to focus exercises and more; this is a worthwhile game for anyone to play. 

The paid version is subscription based, rather than a one-time fee. This could discourage buyers, as the app isn't ""yours forever."" However, that kind of payment is very understandable in this case, considering the new puzzles, audio clips, and articles that must be added to avoid repeating the material.

I highly recommend this app to those of all skill levels. It will stretch and challenge you. Whether you are an avid learner in school, or an adult striving to continue learning every day, Elevate is for you."	positive
3439	875063456	education	3	The game is nice and I enjoy it.  I feel like with a lot of the games they got carried away with design aesthetics, which are very nice indeed, and forget how they will impact the actual function of the brain game itself.  Overall, 3 stars.  5for the graphics, though.  if  the game were purely for fun‚Äôs sake, I‚Äôd give it more. Not worth paying the prices they charge when the graphics/UI impair my outcome on certain activities.  For example, the speed reading exercise gives you single words at a time and each word is centrally located, requiring your eyes to stay centered, but other speed reading exercises I‚Äôve done require your eyes to move across a sentence quickly before that sentence disappears, replaced by another, which feels more organic and natural, since it‚Äôs how we actually read.  There are other examples, but this one bugged me the most.	positive
3440	875063456	education	5	"I am a published author, and I also have my own column in two magazines. I was surprised to see how much I have learned using Elevate‚Äôs free trial. After a couple of days, I wrote another article and noticed I was restructuring my sentences based on the tests and games I have played in Elevate. I‚Äôm learning how to better recognize and eliminate tautology in my sentences. 

I‚Äôm also strengthening my math skills. I have become rusty over the years in being able to grasp percentages without a calculator. Elevate is helping me relearn the basics, and I‚Äôm feeling confident in my ability to crunch numbers quickly. I will definitely purchase the app once my free trial is over. $40 a year is chump change for the value I have received in just one week."	positive
3441	875063456	education	4	"I rarely write app reviews, but I felt compelled to do so for this app because it is that good. I bumped into this app while searching for cool apps to download for my new iPad. I was looking for a quick way to work on my skills and this app hit the spot. The daily exercises take less than 10 mins to complete and test your qualitative and quantitative abilities. The interface is fun and intuitive as well. I built a habit and can conclude that using the app has strengthened my skills.
I give the app 4 stars because some of the backend parts of the experience could be improved. For example, the progress sync is sporadic at best and the app crashed as times. I use the app on my phone and my iPad, so progress sync is a must because, as a toddler‚Äôs parent, my usage is unpredictable at best."	positive
3442	875063456	education	3	I loved this app when I first got it. It was an enjoyable way to enhance basic skills.  But there is not enough diversity in the games and they do not add new content often enough.  In particular the listening and speaking components get old fast. There are only 5 games I‚Äôm  one, six in the other, so it takes longer to advance in these categories, and the texts will repeat. Scoring is often off.  I get a high score, but then see +0 points.  There should also be consistency in design. For example, in one math games you submit your answer with a small button at the bottom of the onscreen number pad. In another you type then click on your answer.  I am currently constantly getting them mixed up. In brief, more games are needed in some categories, or at least more frequent updates to content.	positive
3443	875063456	education	5	"As a young person in today‚Äôs society, my attention is constantly being drawn from one place to another, but I still manage to do my daily elevate. I believe I‚Äôm on a 58 day streak, and I‚Äôve only had it 58 days.
I find myself using it in everyday life. Like when I was texting someone, I was about to say ‚ÄúI personally don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs necessary,‚Äù but took out ‚Äúpersonally‚Äù to make my point more concise. I also find myself using some of the math skills in everyday life, and I love how it sharpens up your brain. 
I‚Äôve tried learning games before, and always delete them after a day or two, but this one is different. It‚Äôs fine tuned, it‚Äôs simple, it‚Äôs fun, and engaging. It‚Äôs something I choose to do, and it doesn‚Äôt feel like a chore."	positive
3444	875063456	education	5	"Cannot say enough about this app! Even MAYO CLINIC couldn‚Äôt compare to how this has helped me!

I have MS, and recently I experienced a very severe relapse. Last year at the eye doctor, I was unable to complete an eye exam because my MS was interfering too much with my mental processing... to the point where I couldn‚Äôt read a single line, even when he isolated it. My eyes were just jumping around too much to focus on the line at my eye doctor, so we had to stop the exam, and he couldn‚Äôt give me a new prescription because he couldn‚Äôt determine why I could actually see.  

I‚Äôve been doing eye exercises ever since to help me with eye-tracking so that my eyes can follow the line correctly, and also move to the next one properly.  MS has so much interfered in this that while I used to play piano about 6-hours a day, I stopped completely because 1) my dexterity was lost, and 2) my eyes just couldn‚Äôt follow the sheet music.

Now that I‚Äôve been playing Elevate, which offers Eye Tracking exercises, I can actually FEEL my eye muscles adjusting to the exercise, and I‚Äôm so thrilled! I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get my musical abilities back now."	positive
3445	875063456	education	5	"I love the games on various math, reading, vocabulary, writing and more. It's worth the annual fee as I have been mentally calculating percentages and basic math in my head after using this app daily. I have relied so heavily on calcators most of my life that adding three digits and basic multiplication had become a challenge. Plus I've realized how bad my spelling has become since auto correct fixes most of my mistakes.

I'm so grateful someone finally created this app! I feel that technology has actually dumbed down society in a way that we constantly reach for our phones to do everything for us. Now I can open this app on my phone to ""elevate"" my mind with games that are fun and educational. 

Thank you!!"	positive
3446	875063456	education	5	I used several brain training apps when they first started appearing a few years ago, and they were usually underwhelming. But Elevate is awesome. It targets a whole lot of specific, useful skills and gives immediate feedback. I really want to purchase the full app when my free trial runs out. I love playing it because I can feel my language skills and writing improve with each game, as well as my math. I would say I‚Äôm addicted, but usually I get addicted to games that I feel bad about playing once I‚Äôm done, but I never regret a long session on Elevate (and if you only have a few minutes a day, the daily group of exercises they recommend are probably the biggest bang for your buck).	positive
3447	875063456	education	4	It definitely functions well at training some ver fundamental and important skills into you. However there are a couple small things that bother me. First off the initial test used for initial placement is very short and locks you into a difficultly level that you can‚Äôt quickly move out of. In my case I missed a couple initial questions because I had never used the app and didn‚Äôt quite understand the structure of the questions or how the interface works. As a result I‚Äôm forced to start at a difficulty level that I feel is a bit to easy. With the max difficulty you can go up in a game set at 5 levels out of 400, I‚Äôm getting top marks over and over on low difficulty levels and I‚Äôm barely moving up.	negative
3448	875063456	education	1	I downloaded the app and was taking advantage of the 7 day free trial. After the trial was over I received no kind of notification as to the fact that I was going to be charged. The monthly fee was $7.99, and the yearly subscription was $35. Not only did they charge me for the yearly subscription without me choosing that option, They charged me for the first month separately. So now I owe almost $45 for an app that I deleted a few days after downloading. Now I am not too familiar with the ins and outs of iPhone so I was not aware that I had to go into my AppleID to actually cancel my subscription. Not only that but to view your Apple ID on your phone you have to have a Wi-Fi connection it will not work on data. So now I‚Äôm stuck paying this $45 for an app that I didn‚Äôt keep for more than the free trial. Very disappointed and I will be contacting the BBB for false advertising because of the amount of the charge.	negative
3449	875063456	education	5	"I have done other memory games but this is the very best. In other games, I would find myself getting frustrated as the difficulty progressed too rapidly, and I would eventually stop using it. This one has such a great variety of categories and subcategories that it keeps it interesting and fun, while improving skills. I can feel the improvement in myself.

A note to the developers. With the latest version of iPhone XS, swiping up closes the app. A prime example is the swiping up in the Math estimation exercise, when increasing my speed of selection, it closes with the exercise. A slight upgrade would be a good fix for this exercise and others that require swiping up."	positive
3450	875063456	education	2	Giving two stars to this app because it was unreasonably hard to cancel my subscription. I mean, seriously? Is that how you‚Äôre going to keep the fish in your net? I didn‚Äôt even use this app much and thought the app was reasonably effective at what it‚Äôs advertised for. I also felt that it was so despicable that I had to waste 15 minutes of my time trying to figure out how to not give this company my money. And that is surely by design. I refuse to support a company that plays bs games like this. Sorry. Im absolutely certain that there is a way to incorporate cancelling the subscription from within the app without wasting people‚Äôs lives. Feels like childish neediness. But then again, that‚Äôs how most  companies operate today: like children throwing a fit wondering how in the world you‚Äôve decided to stop giving them your business. Peace.	positive
3451	522826277	education	5	This is the first app I‚Äôve ever reviewed! But I have to say how this app has been so amazing for our family! My 5 year old son has autism and receives a lot of special services including seeing numerous teachers and therapists at school. Before this app I was never able to keep up with all the emails, found it impossible to go through everything and respond to everyone in a timely manner. Once his school started using Remind, all the important communications, the stuff directly from his teachers regarding things in his specific care, now had their very own home on my phone, and the unique style alerts easily combined to separate these important messages from the noise of my constantly roaring email inbox! With this app I have been able to GREATLY improve my communications with my son‚Äôs teachers and therapists at school and it allows so much better cross communication between the entire group on his team as well! I think every school should be using this app. Teachers, get your classroom on here! Parents, send Remind invites to your children‚Äôs teachers! I love this app so much and hope to see it used everywhere soon!	positive
3452	522826277	education	1	This app is apparently too hard for some teachers to set up. I sent a message to my child‚Äôs teacher at about 9:45 pm one evening and the message wasn‚Äôt received by the teacher until around 3 am when it woke her up because she had her am/pm switched around in her available hours and had it programmed mistakenly to go to her personal cell phone.  When I arrived at the school the next morning to drop off my children I was met at the car/curb by two administrators who demanded that I meet them across campus at an admin office where I was accused of hacking into a teachers personal life and obtaining her cell phone number!! Luckily I was able to prove that I sent the message at around 9:45 pm vs the reported 3 am by showing them the app and the message to clear myself. However, this resulted in the teacher getting embarrassed &/or still not trusting me and she didn't think she could continue being my child‚Äôs teacher. So, my son was transferred to a different teacher where he went through an entire school year being constantly abused verbally and physically. Now 2 years later, the teacher who was too stupid to understand how to properly set up her app is now my child‚Äôs teacher again and even though I refuse to use the remind app to communicate with her she has created a new nightmare for my child this year!!!	negative
3453	522826277	education	4	"I love this app. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because I think you should be able to send longer messages. I often have to send 3 messages to relay the week‚Äôs reminders, which is annoying to me and the parents. Also, I have to keep a parent contact log and I wish there was a way to sort the dates of messages sent directly to the parents that aren‚Äôt whole class messages. I have to go into each parent and do them one by one and it takes forever- so a sort drop down menu filter would be nice.

What‚Äôs great? The fact you can go back and look at old messages. I actually had a parent try to sue our school because she said her child slipped on the bathroom floor and lost a permanent tooth. On the day her daughter was playing with the sink water, she did slip and lose a tooth, but her mom texted me through remind and said, ‚Äú thank goodness the doctors said it was a baby tooth, her permanent one is getting close to coming in.‚Äù Lawsuit saved! I also like that it lets you attach pics. I often take pics of school flyers or homework sheets and send."	positive
3454	522826277	education	5	"This is an amazing app to use. You can use it for many different things, you can use it for school or just for groups for school. You can use it for work. You can pretty much use it for anything related to learning or working. It‚Äôs an awesome app to have because it has helped me to remember things for school I mainly use it for my beta club stuff. You can add friends and different things in it, and you can also, you can make your own profile. You can add friends on it and it‚Äôs just a really good app to use if you forget things like I do and I just love to see what things and opportunities for school and mainly my group for school, beta. Whoever made this app is amazing I could give them a huge thumbs up, and also I want to give he/she a hug because of this app I am able to remember things for beta club. THANKS FOR GIVING ME TJIS OPPORTUNITY to make a review. 

P.S. I want to say thank you again and I want to meet the person who made this app because they are a genius or they all or all geniuses"	positive
3455	522826277	education	2	This app is...kind of......ok-ish. This app used to be great! I will be honest and say that the app WAS awesome in the past. However, now it‚Äôs just a necessary annoyance. I use it now only because I need it to keep in touch with the schools that my children attend. The stream of messages with no division of which school or class is annoying. The inability to leave a school is annoying. Yes. I get that there is a way to delete a school, but it doesn‚Äôt work every time. Try it. It won‚Äôt always work. I have a teacher who has two different groups. They both go to the same stream because they were both sent out by the same person. That gets confusing because I have to check the header of each and every message to see which group is being referred to instead of them being able to be separate even with them having different codes!!! It‚Äôs a different group!! It shouldn‚Äôt come in on the same screen as the other group!!! It‚Äôs just annoying!!! This is the situation for the most active groups on my app. Good luck trying to keep track of everything with this crazy app!!!! I‚Äôm so sad to leave a two star review for what used to be one of my favorite apps. :-( :-( :-(	negative
3456	522826277	education	5	"Remind is a one of a kind tool to use in classrooms, clubs, and really any organization that needs mass communication. It is really simple and easy to use. It can take less than a minute to send a message to the group, and even allows private chats between students and teachers. I think one of the best things about Remind is that it allows teachers to communicate with students without the awkwardness of private phone numbers. It is all done through the app so the numbers are confidential. 

However, the only down side is that it is very difficult to send large messages to the group because there is a character max of about 130. If Remind were the change it to about 200, I think it would make communication even easier. Sometimes there just isn‚Äôt enough space to say all that needs to be said, so the new max character count would aid in that aspect.

Other than that, Remind is a high quality and effortless way to communicate within organizations!"	positive
3457	522826277	education	5	I really enjoy using remind because it‚Äôs user friendly and extremely compatible with all of my apple products. Even my students without smart phones are able to use remind through SMS. I also love the feature of allowing parents to join a class. However, there are a few features that are lacking. I don‚Äôt like that my characters are limited when I send an announcement. I tend to send a lot of attachments and that seems to lower the character count additionally. Also, I like to create videos of my solutions to problems and send them to students. Remind doesn‚Äôt allow for videos to be sent. It does allow pictures to be sent, but if I have a multitude of pictures (for example a packet where each page is its own separate picture), I have to send the pictures one at a time in their own separate messages. I‚Äôm looking forward to updates that will make Remind even more useful for my students and myself.	positive
3458	522826277	education	5	"The Remind app is simply awesome! I struggle with anxiety when it comes to my kids, one high schooler and one kindergartner. I find myself wondering how they are, if they are ok, what‚Äôs going on with them while at school etc. My youngest started kindergarten this year and as most of you know that can be a struggle in itself. The first few weeks there were tears, asking teachers to call ‚Äúmama‚Äù, etc. The Remind app has helped not only myself but my little one adjust to going to school and being away from me. Knowing I can check in on them or the teachers can check in with me with updates, emergency‚Äôs, class assignments, school functions etc.. its a total game changer! My high schooler can stay in contact with teachers even after school hours for homework questions, help with assignments, etc. Thats a plus itself! 
I can breathe easy knowing I can be & stay in contact with my kids teachers at anytime! 
I‚Äôm so grateful for the Remind app. We Love it!"	positive
3459	522826277	education	5	This App is great! I am glad I can finally keep in contact with my teachers over the weekend or even when school is out and there is no after school tutoring. There are so many great things about this app to talk about but I do have one complaint. See I move a lot being a military family and also moving schools. So when I try to switch my schools to my current one it kept saying that it wasn‚Äôt advised to do it and wouldn‚Äôt let me it took me 46 minutes until I was able to get my school switched with the help of a teacher. I thought it would automatically switch when I became registered in a different school because I am in high school and it said I was in middle school. And because it said I was in middle school I couldn‚Äôt join any of my high school classes on remind. I would just like it to be less complicated in the future. But otherwise this App is 5 Star!! I recommend it to all of my friends all the time!	positive
3460	522826277	education	2	"I mostly like the premise of this app. It does exactly what it says it will do mostly perfectly. Students like it and it‚Äôs easy to use. However, a couple things drive me crazy:
1) it‚Äôs impossible to clear notifications. I HATE seeing the notification tag on my devices and it‚Äôs impossible to get rid of them. I have spent an eternity combing through the thousands of messages I‚Äôve received over the past three years, none of them are unread, yet I still have four notifications that will NOT go away. Grrrr. 
2) I know that app designers want us to constantly use their apps, but this one goes too far. It will send me 20 notifications a day, with no options on which to receive and how. They‚Äôre either off or on which makes the app either useless or completely obnoxious. There‚Äôs no in between and that is annoying. 
I‚Äôve now uninstalled this app for the second time. That means I only use the web browser version, which is not as convenient, but at least it can‚Äôt bombard me with notifications that are impossible to remove. Please fix and I will reinstall!"	negative
3461	522826277	education	5	The Remind App is great. I had never even heard of it until the beginning of the school year when my daughter‚Äôs teacher sent all of us parents a link to do it. It‚Äôs just fantastic. But if you don‚Äôt have a school, or teacher that‚Äôs on top of it and sends out the reminders then clearly it‚Äôs not going to work. It‚Äôs great though to get reminders the night before, or the morning of, ab any changes or special events at school. They even use it to tell us if school is cancelled or delayed due to snow, and send class pictures from special occasions. And you can comment or ask questions, privately, or publicly so other parents that might have the same questions can see it. It‚Äôs also secure, it‚Äôs individual to each class within each school, and the admin has to approve your request to join, or send an invite link. With life being so hectic this is truly something helpful üòâ	positive
3462	522826277	education	5	I have been using this app to communicate with my students‚Äô parents/guardians for several years!  Starting last year, I started added grandparents (as long as parents approved) because they wanted to support their grandchild with anything they had going on at school.  I teach 3rd grade & our administrators do not allow us to text with children, for obvious reasons.  I can send group photos when I take special pictures like: First day if school, homecoming week dress up days, fire prevention week, and this week we are doing Red Ribbon week!  Everyone enjoys knowing what‚Äôs happening at school!  This is a format that allows me to share ‚Äúgreat things‚Äù instead of just negative phone calls.  Parents are much more helpful when they see the teacher as a positive and meaningful person in the life of their child!  Remind gives them this new perspective!  Thank you for this app!  Teacher 3B! üêù	positive
3463	522826277	education	4	"Easy to set up, easy to get subscribers, easy to use. Great app for keeping groups informed. I use it for my Sunday School class to keep them informed of events and needs of the class.

I have been using this app for almost 2 years now, and I'm still happy with the product. Recent update to the app however, have made it more difficult for me to see the messages. I am visually impaired and need more of a high contrast between text and background. Even when using the accessibility options in the Apple iOS, messages are still difficult to see because of the color schemes that were selected by the developer. Unfortunately, pastels seem to be the big thing now so this is not the only app I have difficulty with. Perhaps allowing users to pick a color scheme in settings would be appropriate

I am looking forward to the day when the app takes advantage of Dark mode to make viewing easier."	positive
3464	522826277	education	1	"I‚Äôve heard and read so many great reviews for this app, including from my colleagues so I after two terms of hearing about it, I finally decided to try it. Lucky me! üòí I‚Äôm not sure what I did wrong but within seconds, it has already been a fail. I‚Äôve tried uninstalling and installing and was still a total fail. 

After setting up my classroom, I went to enter some contacts and it got stuck at asking me what I wanted people to call me, which I had already done in the initial setup. Already strange that it was asking me this again. I typed my name again, and chose ‚ÄúMs‚Äù for the title; then hit next. First it changed what I entered and added an ‚ÄúM.‚Äù in front of my name and no title. It then would not advance to the next screen. I repeatedly hit next and it just kept repeating the same screen name question. I even uninstalled and when I installed again; it eerily would reload and show the last screen from before I uninstalled it - still asking me what name. A major glitch to be sure. It just kept blipping ‚ÄúWhat do you want students to call you?‚Äù Call me baffled and disappointed."	negative
3465	522826277	education	3	"Partially though the year my app notifications just stopped. I would suddenly realize I hadn‚Äôt heard anything in weeks so I‚Äôd check the app and see everything waiting for me. Then promptly forget to look into why. Repeat over and over until finally I turned on mobile notifications and turned push notifications from the app off. Went looking for info about school and realized I never figured out what was going on with the app. At this point I could just delete it. Now it says I have 29 notifications but nothing I do clears the number. 

I would also love to clear messages sent to the jr high teachers and teachers from previous years. I remove the teacher but those old messages stay there under conversation. I feel like it would free up phone space if I could delete them. 

The app is wonderful when it works especially when teachers use it but over the last year it‚Äôs been hit or miss... mostly miss."	positive
3466	522826277	education	4	The remind app is great, it helps me know when assignment or tests are coming depending on what grade I‚Äôm in on my phone. However in this case I‚Äôve been in a conversation ever since May, I haven‚Äôt been able to leave the conversation even when I looked it up on online and using the help center. It said there was a bar where It say X to leave conversation where the icon is. I tapped on the Icon and all I saw was my teacher, the info on the view profile, the options to block or report, and the conversation history email option . I have no idea how get out of this conversation. I‚Äôm a student first year into high school and I‚Äôm still in the conversation back from end of May that isn‚Äôt even necessary to me with no way to leave myself. If you could add in a way to leave a conversation for students it would help so much for anyone else having this problem.	positive
3467	522826277	education	4	"My only child started kindergarten this year so Remind was brand new to our house & this level of communication between parent & teacher was a pleasant surprise. Remind does exactly what you‚Äôd want or need it to & is very simple to use. üíïüëçüèºüèÜ

The only reason I left the 4-star rating rather than 5 is that a few times (usually last minute early mornings) the message or announcement will show a sent time stamp of a few hours earlier than it‚Äôs received. 

If his teacher sends an all-parent notice out at 645am there have been a few times we don‚Äôt rcv until after 9/930am when kids are already off & gone for their day. The bummer is it‚Äôs likely too late to address. I‚Äôm not certain however if the problem is somehow the school / teacher piece or within the apps function... I just know other neighborhood parents, w/ different classes & teachers, have experienced the same issue."	negative
3468	522826277	education	3	The concept is great. Being able to touch bases with your child‚Äôs school/teacher is an amazing feeling and builds trust between family/ school. Having said this, all this wonderful potential is cut short if the teacher turns off the ability for the parents to send messages to teachers. Also, teachers have the option to sign up and use the app or not at all. Again, no app automizes the human response, but this one would be better if more teachers embraced this technology and used it *for the entire school year* not just in the beginning when everything‚Äôs exciting. Too many parents have been left out of emailing their kids teachers because of some weird school site programmers restrictions that kick outside emails to the spam bin. I would like to see in a future update for this app that teachers are not able to turn off parents comments. Really sends the cold shoulder to a lot of families when it really is all about the kids.	positive
3469	522826277	education	5	"We have used this app extensively for our Drama Club for the last three years and it‚Äôs absolutely invaluable. Parents and students can be so easily and quickly contacted about anything! Especially last minute rehearsal changes, and reminders for when things are due.

The app does have a couple of small bugs - it doesn‚Äôt refresh well without clicking out of the screen and back again; sometimes it‚Äôll say I‚Äôve got a message on my notifications, but it won‚Äôt show up on the app unless I close it and open it again. But these really minor bugs don‚Äôt make the use of the app even uncomfortable. It just costs an extra 10 seconds a day, but the app itself saves us hours! So I think it‚Äôs absolutely 100% worth putting up with the minor bugs.

I LOVE this app! Thank you for making it!"	positive
3470	522826277	education	5	"I had this app for around 4 years, (being during my high school years) after being forced by my classes thanks to the new technology curriculum in my school. Let me say this is a life saver. The teacher will ‚Äòremind‚Äô you when you have things due, an event the next day, or need to being an item to school. There is also a function to privately chat to your teacher, I used it to ask questions on weekends for projects due.
However this app is only as good as the teacher and student who use it if the teacher is willing to remind. 
Although, I enjoyed the app, the notifications are not repeated, the ui and interface is simple, and it‚Äôs easy to add classes.
Definitely recommend for the forget me not students out there that is busy and stressed with multiple class work"	positive
3471	522826277	education	5	"Update: The developers reached out to me promptly and corrected the error! It is now working properly. 
Even with this one issue, I highly recommend this app!
There has been the number 1 beside my app for over two months now! I have contacted Remind multiple times and asked for their help and nothing! I have done everything I know to figure out why it is there. I even archived the group that the red dot was beside and it still won‚Äôt go away. This is beyond annoying! I have two kids that are in multiple groups that I receive notifications. I don‚Äôt want to constantly have to worry that I‚Äôve missed a notice because of this problem. Can someone please help me with this matter?!?! 
This is a great communication tool when it‚Äôs working properly! I do wish you were able to write more words in the body of the message."	positive
3472	522826277	education	5	"Hello! I think this app is great! It keeps students in touch with teachers. However, I do have a few things to announce; Some good, some bad.

     First off, this app is very useful for communicating (obviously), and you can plan out times. I even used my old email to create a teacher account and I used a made-up school. The purpose is to help kids in my class; but I don‚Äôt really have friends so this is sadly impossible.

     Second, I found a glitch. On my main account (Student account), I cannot change my picture. When I go to ‚Äúedit‚Äù and select a photo for it to be, then I exit, it says, ‚ÄúChanges complete!‚Äù. When I refresh the app, however (Close app entirely then re-open it), my picture I chose isn‚Äôt there! If you could fix that, it would be REALLY helpful.

      Lastly, I think it‚Äôs cool that we can send pictures. That way, students can tell which paper you mean. For example, if you gave out a homework on day one, then another the next day, and one is due on day 3, you can take a picture to show which homework you mean, or which was assigned that day.

     That is all for my review. All in all, this app meets all the requirements of a good student-teacher communication app. I rate this ‚Äú5 stars‚Äù because it is simply just USEFUL! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"	positive
3473	522826277	education	5	I like that the app provides a way to text students without using my personal information and cell phone number. And it provides a platform to send group messages. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because there needs to be a way for us administrators of the app to make changes to a student‚Äôs account‚Äî for example if a student‚Äôs name is misspelled (often due to autocorrect) and it‚Äôs submitted, I can‚Äôt change it, only the student can. Also, once I put the student‚Äôs cell phone and email, I can‚Äôt see this information. So if I need to update and make changes to this info, or if I need to call the student or email the student, I don‚Äôt have access to the information. Also, it is frustrating that there‚Äôs a limit to how many characters I can use when sending group texts.	positive
3474	522826277	education	1	I like the app! But‚Ä¶ There are some things that could definitely be improved. The first and biggest issue is the maximum characters restriction. Remind allows you to write a message up to 140 characters. This forces me as a teacher to condense my messages so much that at times I am not able to get my whole message across. Granted, I can always send another message, but As most of you know, most students will not look farther back than the most recent message. That means that they are missing valuable information at times. The app lost 2 stars because of this one. Secondly, I‚Äôm not a fan of how a recipient is not able to click on a link directly from the message and be taken to the corresponding website. The user is forced to click on the Files tab to be able to open those links. This causes much consternation for me as my students didn‚Äôt bother to click on the file tab and just don‚Äôt bother looking into it further as they figured the link was just bad and now have an excuse to ignore the message altogether.	negative
3475	522826277	education	4	I really appreciate the fact that I can text my students as a class and individually while all of us maintain the privacy of our phone numbers. This is much more effective than the email system our school provides. Teens hardly ever check emails, but they do check texts. I send reminders about homework, projects, and tests; I contact guys who have left their books or their coats in class; I give them a heads-up about inclement weather; and I send notes of praise and thanks as well as offers of extra help and do-overs. The only reason for the four instead of five stars is the limited number of characters in the text that I can send. I usually have to go back and abbreviate heavily or end up sending two messages. Evidently, my school has not bought into the upgrade that would give me the ability to send slightly longer messages.	positive
3476	522826277	education	3	"I like the app, and it really helps me for my teachers to be able to notify me of upcoming assignments and due dates. Although I have a small issue, on the gear icon for the settings, there is always a orange dot when I am using the app, on my tablet. I use my phone for actually getting notifications from this app, but I use my tablet just to check back on past messages from my teachers, and this is why I have notifications completely turned off on my tablet. But, I feel it is a bit unnecessary that, every time I open the app on my tablet, it insists on ""warning"" me that I have notifications turned off. I know that this issue of mine is, most likely, not even a problem in your eyes, but it would be nice to not have this supposed warning, at the top left of my screen, while in the app. Thank you for making this app, and reading this long rant of mine.

Sincerely,
A Student User"	positive
3477	522826277	education	2	"I‚Äôm a new user to the app, and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs generally great. However, somehow the app assigned me to a school that‚Äôs not even in my district! I see the Remind website provides guidance on how to remove a school, but it seems it only works when on a computer - not through the app on my iPhone and iPad. I realize overall it‚Äôs a minor issue, but it‚Äôs a major pet peeve for me when the functionality of a website and an app are not the same. I hope this isn‚Äôt user error on my end, but I tried everything I could think of to find a way to remove the school to no avail. *sigh*

Update - when trying to reset my password on the app it asks for a new password and to confirm the password. When I click save it says the old password is required to change it. Makes sense - except there is no field for the current password! 

This app is driving me bonkers. I‚Äôm truly only using it because my daughters teacher requires it."	positive
3478	522826277	education	5	"I found that the app was incredibly easy to set up and to use. I didn‚Äôt know much about the app, at first. I wanted to give 5 stars for a few reasons. 

1 - This app has a very nice and slick user interface. It‚Äôs simple to navigated and find what you want in just a single tap or 2. 

2 - The app has features that make it very easy to make and set a reminder. It‚Äôs very good to have when taking several classes and labs. 

3 - This app does not require a lot of sensitive personal or financial data. Just enter some simple and basic contact information.

4 - The app looks very clean and that‚Äôs very good to have when you happen to check what reminder or alert you have set up.

5 - The app is free. And for a free app, it really was designed very well. 

I think you‚Äôll find this app very useful. It doesn‚Äôt require a lot of memory on your smart phone or tablet. Because the app uses so little space, it doesn‚Äôt require or use much power from your phone / table to use. I would recommend trying this app to find out if you like it or find it useful. 
For something that would be very useful and free that can be of help to you, while in college, I would recommend giving it a try."	positive
3479	522826277	education	5	We have always used another major app for communicating with my stepsons teachers, and we‚Äôre definitely not very fond of it and have a lot of problems with it and always have the entire 3 years we‚Äôve been using it. It wasn‚Äôt until this year when my daughter started kindergarten that I found out there was another app for communicating with teachers. I have been happy with Remind since first downloading it and now after using it for over a month of regularly talking to my daughters teacher- I absolutely LOVE IT. It‚Äôs much more reliable than other similar platforms. I also love that you can communicate with other parents if need be. It‚Äôs simple, easy to use, and reliable. I would recommend Remind over other similar platforms over and over again!	positive
3480	522826277	education	4	"I love remind. I use it on a weekly basis. I have been part of remind for 2 years now and I can say that my students really love it. However, I don't like the current version of the app. It is hard to find where I can write a message. I feel like I am navigating back and forth and never find what I am looking for. The layout as as is has been the most difficult for me to use and I consider myself technology buff. Hope there is an update with changes soon. Neverless, still use this program folks! Students love it.  (I currently use the desktop version because it's easier for me)

Update: navigation has gotten a lot better. Easier to find where to send messages.  Now my biggest complaint is that I get a notification for the same message sent to different classes. I don‚Äôt remember this happening until this fall of 2018."	positive
3481	522826277	education	5	"I am mother to three school-aged children and this app is wonderful! All of their teachers and coaches (elementary and jr high, 21 ‚Äúclasses‚Äù in all) use Remind and it helps so much to have all their notes and reminders and updates show up in one place. Thank you so much for making my life more organized!

One suggestion for a feature I couldn‚Äôt find, but would make the app even easier to use. It would be so helpful if I could create folders or label or otherwise group classes so I could instantly tell which class goes with which of my children. It gets tricky to tell which class goes with which, especially when two of my children have the same teacher or class in different years. It would be a big bonus to an already great app."	positive
3482	522826277	education	4	I have two preschool classes set up in Remind. I am also a parent signed up under my children‚Äôs teachers. I absolutely love this connection to parents and families. I wish my most recent conversations with individual parents would stay at the top of my list. It shows me messages that went out to every parent. For instance, my recent message history will say each parent‚Äôs name and the message I sent to the whole group. I also noticed that any time a parent messages me, I have to scroll through almost our entire message to get to the newest one. Maybe that‚Äôs just me. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Seeing or finding my scheduled messages is always confusing for me as well. I wish that was its own tab or section to click on. Minor things, but those are my observations. Keep Remind the best parent/teacher communication out there!	positive
3483	522826277	education	2	Fine app considering it is free. The help/FAQ doesn‚Äôt match the actual app. Not sure if this is iOS specific, but even trying to change the ‚Äúno replies‚Äù option can‚Äôt be done based on the archaic directions through Remind. There is a major character limit which is frustrating. It seems that at least a few sentences would be allowed. People (class members) are constantly confused about what they have to do or if they need the actual Remind app. I don‚Äôt find the layout to be particularly intuitive. Am definitely doing to be searching for an alternative. This app gives me some light frustration, but to reference the FAQ and it NOT having actual updated information and, in one case, the layout of the FAQ had the iOS instructions to the right and‚Äî wait for it‚Äî completely cut off the screen and out of view. Fine for a basic group messaging app, but even a minor setting change is an issue.	negative

It helps me get out reminders that I forgot to tell my students in class, remind them about projects and long-term assignments, Develop relationships with students that may not typically speak up in class, and help answer questions or problems that students/parents have a quickly and efficiently.  All of my students and their parents signed up for Remind at the beginning of the year. I hand out the instructions for how to sign up at back to school night and explain how I use it with the parents. 

I think one of the most exciting things that Remind has done recently is allow teachers to link their Google classroom account to their Remind account to streamline and makes it simple to send out important announcements that require an attached document to students in one quick click of a button. 

There are many more helpful qualities about this app, so I recommend downloading it and exploring. It is extremely user-friendly and easy to pick up without ever using it before and you don‚Äôt need another person to explain anything!

 I highly recommend this ANY teacher!!!"	positive
3485	522826277	education	5	"Okay, so I'm having trouble with something from your app. When I tried to add my parent on the parents list, something pop up that said, ""You're not allowed to make this parent-child relationship."" I was confused so i searched about it. The only results I got were the instructions on how to add family members on the list(which I already knew how to do.) Asking my peers was no use either. They all told me they didn't come upon this and so now I'm struggling on this. From all that aside, this app is honestly very useful when it comes to my school work, since this is the only communication I can use to talk to my teachers for any work during quarantine and I'm always updated on announcements the things I need to do."	negative
3486	522826277	education	4	"I teach preschool and just started using remind this school year.   It is a great app and saves me a lot time since I can send out messages to everyone at once.  My one problem is that I have a co-teacher and we have not been able to add her in a meaningful way without my winding up with her kids‚Äô remind notices in my account. So consequently she is unable to communicate with parents directly.  It would work much better if we both had the ability to communicate and could see all messages from parents but also remained independent.  

The character count initially gave me problems but I solved the issue by creating  a poster, taking a screen shot of it and then sending it out.  I‚Äôve also done that with forms, etc.  Now it‚Äôs not a big deal."	positive

And one more thing, can you please allow at least 160 words to type on for my announcements for my classes. What I do nowadays is cut my messages to different messages kinda annoying to my students‚Äô notification ... one notification is enough I think .

Anyway, thank you for your time indeed a very good useful app, keep up the good apps. God bless..."	positive
3488	522826277	education	4	"This app is wonderful because it allows me to communicate with my college students. Nothing only that, it allows me to actually download and/or print all messages from students as well as all communications. My only problem or concern is that I have to limit my wording in each message I send (or simply type multiple messages) because Remind only allows so many characters in each message space. That makes it aggravating not only for me but my students, as they receive several back to back messages for just one announcement. On the flip side of that...it is helping me learn to eliminate excessive wordiness! Ha! Ha!

Overall this is still a great app...Just please fix my problem and allow at least a few more characters for each message!

This app has allowed me to be really involved in my children‚Äôs well being in school and in their academics! I LOVE remind and am truly grateful that our school is using it!

3490	522826277	education	4	I have been using this app for three years with my middle school students and parents. Overall, it works very well for quick notifications for tests, a quiz, or homework. However, I‚Äôve found the area to compose your message is limited. The space does not allow for a list/items, multiple dates, and/or descriptions. Sending each item can make for one‚Äôs cell phone to be ringing like crazy. Granted, if I needed to send a full email I could. For the teachers that are trying to cleverly hook/get their students attention, I feel more messaging space is needed. Parents have been super excited about the app and the more students who have access to a smart phone, iPod, etc. the more engaged they are. The result is independent and responsible learners.	positive
3491	522826277	education	5	I love how easy this makes staying in communication with teachers and the PTA. If I forget something and need to drop it off, I text the teacher. If I‚Äôm at the store at night and want to know if the class needs something, I can find out quickly. If I need clarification on homework, easy. If it‚Äôs my child‚Äôs birthday and I need to know how many treats to bring, I just shoot a quick text. This morning I woke up to a PTA reminder that today was crazy hair day. I totally forgot, but my kids were able to participate. Last week my preschooler was having a melt down at drop off. A few minutes later the teacher sent me a pic of him sitting happily on the carpet to set my mind at ease. This app is a MUST!	positive

Bit this app needs some serious improvement and it seems like no one is even looking. 

I want to send my daughter‚Äôs teacher a message. He sends the entire class updates fairly regularly so he is definitely a user.  I try first through his post to send him a direct reply.  Nope. Can‚Äôt do that. So I search for his name.  I enter his full last name and get a list of people that aren‚Äôt even remotely similar to what I typed. So I search by all names but the list is truncated at the first part of the M‚Äôs. Both his first and last names begin after that. Reverse order?  No luck there either. 

Frustrating, to say the least. All I want to do is communicate with someone. Isn‚Äôt that what the app is for?  Then why should it be difficult to do that?  

It shouldn‚Äôt be difficult to do the very something for which the app is designed. Since it is in this case, there is no way the app can receive any more than the two stars I gave it.  Why two and not one?  Because it‚Äôs a good concept. Now it has failed. No problem. Now fix it. 

As for the DMV reference...  Thank you for reading. :-)."	negative
3493	522826277	education	5	This app keeps me up to date with what‚Äôs going on at school and other events that take place outside school. I can send pictures and videos to teachers to ask them questions if I‚Äôm confused or didn‚Äôt go to school that day to ask if they had any work for me to do so I can go pick it up. I also like the emojis that let you tell the teachers and administrators what we think about the remind that was sent. I have my own remind class and it is good for letting people know what is going to be happening and to tell them due dates and things like that.

My one main critique, although not dire, is something that could be easily fixed.I understand that this app is designed for schools and that‚Äôs great but I think it‚Äôs a useful tool for other things as well. It would be nice if instead of just having the option of ‚Äúnot affiliated‚Äù there was a custom affiliation that could be added. For example a private music teacher or dojo could list themselves there. Not super important even for these people, but it would be so easy to do and would encourage them to use this service a little more.	positive

The app now with the notifications on shows I have 3 unread messages yet all my messages are read. This is a problem because now I have no idea if I have actual messages or not due to this glitch. I have tried everything I can think of and the notification will not go away. I even uninstalled the app and reinstalled it which clearly doesn‚Äôt fix the problems. The app is glitchy and confusing because it has messages from two different groups o joined in the same message thread. I prefer the text messages! I think Verizon is being unfair but this is what we get for electing Trump because he allowed net neutrality to exist-net neutrality is why Verizon can do this to Remind.	negative
3497	522826277	education	3	I use Remind all the time. Such a great tool for communication with students, parents, etc. I use it most on field trips. When the kids (high school) are let free for lunch, we use it to get them back together in time for our bus departure. No more late students! Also, I love the fact that you can schedule messages ahead of time & attach photos, files, etc. A true time saver. So why only 3 stars? First, the character limit is challenging. I sometimes have to send multiple messages instead of one and then I get irate replies from parents/students. Second, and more importantly, it‚Äôs been MONTHS and the false notifications still hasn‚Äôt been fixed. I‚Äôm showing 2 missed messages and I can‚Äôt get rid of the false missed message notification.

I look forward to being able to quickly reach my kids teachers during our distance learning over the coming weeks. The only thing I would like to see is a way to organize. It would be wonderful if I could easily glance and be able to tell the chat streams apart by grade or student or even school. As my kids are in a few different classes that are titled similarly. Maybe be able to group them up myself on my screen. Something anyway. Otherwise it‚Äôs a wonderful app.	positive

Thank you for providing an easy to use, and extremely necessary communications tool for students, teachers, parents, and administrators at our nation's institutions of learning. My family relies on Remind daily to keep informed of the latest class assignments, announcements, and school administration communications. I would like to make one suggestion related to notifications.  I would like to customize notifications for each class that I belong to, such that I may choose the type of notification that I receive from each class.

However, it lacks the instant aspect of the text messages. Yes, notifications come through instantly, but to view them or reply, it takes a while. The notification system within the app feels glitchy, like how it doesn't show the new message instantly, the ""unread"" indicator doesn't always go away after it is read in all classes or within the class sometimes, and the app number badge doesn't go away all the time. Overall though, the app works well except for those annoying tendencies."	positive

In most part I‚Äôm 100% in agreement with the previous review about the new Feb 2019 update. However, once I changed(Reorder) the home page, I do not have the issue with my home page resetting back to the default after I close the app & then reopen it on my iOS device. And who uses the term ‚ÄúReorder‚Äù to to identify the procedure to rearrange, edit or manage the home screen? I originally thought it was for reordering of more devices. I do agree there is too much wasted space and would prefer the  information being a little more condensed vs. having to scroll down the page. And, I also agree with the alerts/alarms. I‚Äôve checked my settings numerous times, but if my iPhone is locked or if I do not have the App open, I do not receive /hear any notification from the App of a sensor being tripped. Notification can be resolved with IFTTT but would think the App itself would be able to provide that notification. I would the ability to remove a room from the home page, but have yet to find a way to do so. I do appreciate the improvements that Samsung made in an effort to improve the App and suspect there is a learning curve on my part, but I would like the user to have the capability/flexibility to manage their home screen the way the user wants it vs how Samsung thinks it should be."	positive
3502	1222822904	lifestyle	2	In 2017 I purchased 2 multi-purpose sensors. They were great on garage doors. Once connected to the hub, it was less than 30 seconds to attach to a garage door and they did a great job of indicating the door was open when horizontal and closed when vertical. No more wondering ‚Äúdid the door close?‚Äù, a notification indicated closed and was part of my security system to indicate someone had opened the door. Sometime in January 2020 the app made the sensor a bi-purpose sensor only. No warning or notification! The tilt function removed! I went back to the classic app at suggestion of Samsung support (very time-consuming as I had to reset the hub and then had to completely re-add ALL sensors/lights etc... to BOTH apps!).  No tilt in old app either. I attempted to connect one sensor as a contact sensor but with the rails and wheels, this was very difficult (the WHOLE reason the tilt function was so great!). Also once it was installed as a contact sensor, it only took one opening of the garage door to knock the magnet off somewhere along the path and jam the door! I‚Äôve spent at least an hour re-doing both apps and reinstalling a sensor and still have no solution! I reluctantly give 2 stars because it was a great, simple solution for 2 years. I suppose if I buy a newer version of the multipurpose sensor it might work?!??!  NOT going to keep buying sensors and I have guarantee that will even work and for how long?	positive
3503	1222822904	lifestyle	2	"You able to use this with a 2018 Samsung Smart TV. Now you can search for shows from the in app hub for it. But I see shows in there that I know are on Netflix but it does not state that. Same stuff for some other apps. To put icing on the cake, its a smart TV which at times requires typing things into each app, yet does not have a on screen keyboard in the app that I can find. There is even a internet explorer where you have to use the tv remote with an on screen keyboard. 

Now i get it maybe you are trying to push people to buy keyboards and set them alongside of your TV. That I have to say is pretty annoying, I already have one and it is annoying to switch between remote and keyboard. I traded in a different TV that had was supported from a competitor nick named Goku TV for this comment. In that app, not only can you type on your TV screen through the app, but you can stream the tv sound through your phone. It is truly innovative compared to this application. That can only control on/off, +/- Volume/Channel, 0-9 numbers, previous channel, up-down-left-right, and power. To top it all off its pretty laggy. It also has accurate searches through the app. Its sad that I will probably replace the smart side of this TV by plugging in a Goku TV adapter to the HDMI port."	positive
3504	1222822904	lifestyle	1	Garbage app and garbage developers. This app worked fine for the first year I had it and lately after an update (presumably) all of my 60+ devices show up as disconnected. I can still function them if I click on them individually to see their status but in the main window they all show up as disconnected, THEREFORE, the user has no idea what the actual status of any given device is at any given time. Which makes this app useless. The whole purpose of having an app to control home automation devices is so that the user can not only control those devices but also to know the status of the devices at any time. Furthermore, to make matters worse, this app has NEVER provided a proper log of actions. The app should be keeping a log of actions for the devices so that you can view the activity log to see when a device changed status but that has NEVER worked from day one. I‚Äôve called to complain about these issues on numerous occasions but these issues still remain unresolved. I‚Äôm very annoyed and I don‚Äôt recommend anybody to buy a Samsung SmartThings Hub nor to download and use this horrendous app. I‚Äôm going to sell my Samsung SmartThings Hub or just throw it in the garbage and buy a different brand that actually works properly and doesn‚Äôt require the user to call and complain every week about these issues.	negative
3505	1222822904	lifestyle	2	"I recently transitioned from Iris by Lowe‚Äôs to SmartThings and bought the hub and motion sensors (among other things). Found it tremendously difficult to connect the ST hub to my existing kwikset and schlage locks (which worked seamlessly with iris).  I‚Äôve also been unable to easily connect my Honeywell thermostat.  

Separately, the ST branded motion sensor is essentially useless. In the app, it will only show me in real time whether there is movement or not (and takes a moment to connect when I go through the app - it‚Äôs not always available).  I would like to be able to see whether there has been movement during the day (and at what times).  Iris used to showed me a bar graph where I could see the movements in my home throughout the day (e.g. no movement between 3-5 pm, movement starting at 5:30, or something like that).  Is this something being addressed in an update?  

So far, I am not a fan of ST, and purposely delayed buying additional ST devices until I could figure out whether it worked well or not.  I only bought the few items I did because Iris gave us a gift card to compensate for the shutdown of their service. I have a Samsung TV and will eventually get around to connecting it in order to salvage some utility out of this thing."	positive
3506	1222822904	lifestyle	4	I‚Äôm impressed that Samsung keeps working to improve the app.  My concern is they think (IMHO) that this is all about automation. Well it is called home automation, but it is also about keeping an eye on your home while you‚Äôre away for any major issues. I am fortunate enough to have my home in Florida and a cottage in Michigan. I think you‚Äôll know where I am in the summer and winter.  I monitor the home in Florida for humidity (I don‚Äôt want mold), temperature and water leaks. In the winter I monitor the cottage for temperature and water leaks. The new and classic SmartThings app needs to have better notifications. How about a badge on the app icon if there is something out of range?  How about having the ‚Äòtiles‚Äô in the app change color to red if a sensor has a warning (the little red dot isn‚Äôt sufficient)?  Those are just two little things that would make the app more useful and user friendly. I believe that it would be more helpful if at a glance the end user can see if the lights are on, there is motion, the dishwasher is leaking, the air conditioner isn‚Äôt keeping the humidity down... you get the idea.	positive

The number one issue is that if I switch to use another app on my phone, then come back to the remote, it is no longer ready to go.  I have to select the TV option from the app‚Äôs home screen again and wait for the remote to open.  Why can‚Äôt it just stay open so I can flip between apps?  By the time I get the dang thing open, Netflix is already playing the next show or preview!  I don‚Äôt even have any other smart devices in my house‚Äîwhy do I need to select ‚ÄúTV‚Äù to even get to the remote every time? I wish I could bookmark the remote somehow so that it automatically opens when I open the app (and have it STAY open even when I swap to read a text or email).  Secondly, why does the remote have a huge square button with tiny little arrow buttons around it to navigate with?  Swiping across the button to navigate is clunky and not intuitive.  Get rid of that and just make the arrow buttons bigger!	positive
3508	1222822904	lifestyle	5	As a very early adopter of the vera system I had been dedicated to using it in spite of many frustrating trials over a period of years. To get the most out of the Vera one had to be very technical. Now that I‚Äôve switched over to smart things I have found many many fewer trials and frustrations and that one needs only to be somewhat technical to get the most out of it. Still one has to be technical for advanced uses. As a plug and play using only certified devices, anyone can use it and get the same degree of automation and security as they would from services such as AT&T or Comcast. This is sufficient for most people and therefore make Smartthings perfect for the masses. The third-party tool called Webcore allows Smartthings to be perfect for those wanting operations governed by complex rules. I bought my hub as part of the Samsung whole house mesh Wi-Fi system which is one of the cheapest on the market if you buy it from Samsung direct, making my hub basically free.	positive
3509	1222822904	lifestyle	2	"I just got my SmartThings Hub v3 yesterday. I really just need it to push to Alexa, which announces when doors open and close but I was getting quite annoyed with this app. For one there was no setting to switch the sensor to Garage mode, secondly, there is no option to allow me to set when doors are ajar, something I read could be done with SmartThings. I finally decided to get the old app, the one Samsung is planning to Sunset and wow, what a difference! That app is full featured compared to this. Not only are these options there but that app also shows me all sensor activity so that I can see exactly what's going on with the sensors.

 I understand that this app is new and you're moving new users towards it but it's a bad idea to do so when it's so very half baked. There are too many missing features to be directing new users to forget about the other app and use this one. 

Right now I have both apps installed but I use the old one mostly. Hopefully this one catches up sooner vs. later. I see nothing wrong with the old app and don't understand why this one was made."	negative
3510	1222822904	lifestyle	3	I like the app and enjoy the ability to access my devices with or without my remote. However, I have some suggestions on how to improve the app so that it is more usable for a tv. First, the left and right arrows are well sized but the top and bottom are much too small. Those buttons are important so that you can hold scrolling rather than constantly having to swipe up and down. I often find myself accidentally selecting a show because I have to look at the tv when scrolling rather than the remote. Second, most times I go back to use the remote the home screen appears with a list of my devices when I really just want to use my remote again. It usually takes about 15-20 seconds to get back to the remote. That is about the time that a next episode on a streaming service will auto play which makes using the app sort of a wash. Anyways, thanks for hearing the feedback and (hopefully) look forward to some quality of life changes! Great app other than those minor things!	positive

Hey Chelsea!  Thanks for responding!! I appreciate it :) Unfortunately, I received a notification that it was time to switch over.

I‚Äôve researched and tried many smart home, automation gears available on the market. I think Samsung SmartThing might be the best option. 
Samsung SmartThings hub can connect to more than 200 devices(more than most other hubs)and lets you create a wide range of different scenarios for all of the gadgets in your home. 
Installation remains extremely basic, largely a matter of plugging the hub into your router and setting up an account with Samsung. (Like the first-generation hub, the second-generation does not integrate Wi-Fi.) From there, you can start adding devices to work with the hub. SmartThings has its own branded sensors and other gear.
The hub has both ZigBee and Z-Wave radios onboard, and two USB ports for local devices."	positive

It‚Äôs painful and frustrating to read many of the seriously negative reviews. On the surface, although claims of user-friendly abound, all digital devices are complex and technical on the inside. If unable to install/setup yourself, obtain the assistance (shop, pay, barter, beg, etc) of a certified IT/network specialist (min 4-5+ yrs exp).

takes a significant time to connect to devices when opening app.  The ‚Äúchecking status‚Äù shows on all devices for a significant amount of time. I have gigabit speed internet, this is not my internets fault. Get rid of the SmartThings loading screen and just logo the homepage to make it snappier. 

Request: granular notification settings. I want to be notified IF a motion sensor is tripped between a specific time.  I do not want to be notified if a light is turned on.  I want to be notified if a device is offline, I don‚Äôt want to be notified that a scene was activated.  Basically, custom notifications. 

Request: list ALL history.  Every action needs to be listed (not just automations and scenes) and as a bonus what device initiated it.  i.e. Living Room turned on by iPhone or Dining Room turned off by iPad.  This helps troubleshoot issues and their origin. 

Request:  support for ip cameras without 3 party coding or software (blue iris, webcore).  In addition to live view tiles.

The biggest thing I don‚Äôt like about the SmartThings app is that you can‚Äôt see any data on the sensor icons on the home page but ‚Äúdry‚Äù. Duh, if it wasn‚Äôt dry I‚Äôd be getting notifications and texts! When I check in to my house remotely I want to see on the home page what Vera gave me, the temperature and battery level at each of my sensors.

Researching this it appears that there were ways to do this in what is now called the ‚ÄúSmartThings Classic‚Äù app. Amazing how new and improved can become new and less."	positive
3516	1222822904	lifestyle	1	I bought a new washer and dryer. Was very excited to use the wifi as I am often rushing to get laundry done. Hey now it can get started on my way home and when I get home I can just switch it over to the dryer. NOPE. Half the time it doesn‚Äôt work and you have remember to push a few buttons on the machine(s) before hand- even though you can see it through the app/communicate through the app you have to manually do other things first. If you want to start it at a certain time, forget about it. You have to set your phone alarm then go in and take care of it, that is if the app hasn‚Äôt shut communication off. The only thing you can do is start the laundry now or start the laundry now and have it slow the process down so much that it can take up to 24 hrs to wash a load of clothes. No one wants their clothes washed for up to 24 straight, it‚Äôs too rough on the clothes. The app has timing functions, it has starting functions. They just decided not to put them together. Which is such a disappointment as  that was the main reason for me buying this set.	positive
3517	1222822904	lifestyle	3	Needs some work. First, home screen order is reset after long period of not using the app. So have to rearrange everything each time I use the app. Second, it does not activate my Home mode when I get home using phone location. Old app worked great and this one just seems to do nothing. Third, UI needs work, so much wasted space and finding things can be very cumbersome. Fourth, widget is pretty useless since it seems to only allow scenes, why not devices so I can see a quick status? Also, some devices do not seem to work correctly, in particular trying to get a multi-sensor to show temp versus motion. Tried altering the device handler and did not seem to make a difference to the tile on home. Maybe I am just not smart enough on that part, but old app seemed to be more reliable and easy to manage that stuff. Lastly, sometimes I get duplicate notifications even though I only have one entry for open/close events.	positive
3518	1222822904	lifestyle	3	"I like the simplicity of use, supported products and integration but a little less thrilled with the detail of control in particularly the inability to have multiple conditions per device or even use the same device as a condition as well as an action.  Like if the light is off turn it on.  Only one condition per device is pretty limiting. Also the lack of sensitivity adjustments for devices like the motion sensor or multipurpose sensor are troubling. Seems like it would be a simple adjustment. Like the multipurpose vibration sensitivity goes off every time the auto lock engages. Would probably fix this with a statement that looks for vibration duration longer than 1 second, but I can‚Äôt reduce the time that low. Wait my bad can‚Äôt reduce the duration at all. 
Overall it‚Äôs a solid entry level product but if you are looking for more detailed automation Samsung isn‚Äôt quite there yet. Hopefully sometime soon."	positive
3519	1222822904	lifestyle	4	I would have given the new app 5 stars, but because it is lacking some of the features the classic app had, I'm giving it 4 stars. I'm sure Samsung will add features before they get rid of the classic app. The features I'm referring to are being able to unlock doors when arrive home. Another is being able to change Security Mode when I arrive home. Right now, if I manually set my alarm to Away, and I come home, the alarm is activated if I forget to turn it off. At this time the only way to set the Security mode through automation is at a specific time. I'm sure Samsun will add these features in a future release. I've been using SmartThings for two years now and like it. One more thing, Samsung needs to have a way to backup the configuration so it can be restored to a replacement hub. Right now you have to reconfigure a replacement hub from scratch.	positive
3520	1222822904	lifestyle	3	I have recently migrated over from Iris by Lowes to STT for 3 different locations. The recent update in the app has some bugs in the iOS platform that need to be resolved. First, the app shows no device activity at all. Another family member has the app on a Samsung S8 and it displays all device activity properly. It does not on my iPhone. Second, as others have mentioned, the app should have a setting for notification tone selection. Without a setting within the app, Apple devices default to a short notification tone and display which is inadequate for a security notification. Third, and less important, the locations have an option to change colors to differentiate them. Unfortunately, after changing respective colors, they all change back to pink when the app is subsequently opened. Again, this occurs on my iPhone. If these 3 improvements would be made, I could give this app 5 stars.	positive
3521	1222822904	lifestyle	5	When I first downloaded the app it didn‚Äôt really work well with my Samsung smart home devices. But recent updates and now everything in my home is working seamlessly. Automations for my robot vacuum actually start without me having to force them and my laundry room informs me about my washer cycles. Good job Samsung on finally giving the app some needed attention. I have been slowly getting smart home appliances and was seriously considering a different manufacturer for my future purchases since I couldn‚Äôt get the Samsung app to do its job correctly. Which would be a shame since I enjoy the Samsung home product line so much. Maybe apple needs to build home appliances so everything I own is on one OS platform. JK Samsung, just keep improving cross platform apps and keep up the good work!!!	positive
3522	1222822904	lifestyle	1	The title says it all. I recently migrated my entire setup from Lowe‚Äôs Iris to SmartThings. The platform was completely exceeding my expectations until I opened this new app about a week ago. I had been using the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù app but thought I would try this one. Very, very bad idea. It split my home into two different virtual locations. I have cloud devices (Arlo, Ring, etc), my hub, and a handful of devices in one location. In the other location I have the remaining devices and all of my smart apps. About 50% of my devices show disconnected at any one time and I do not have the ability to add new smart apps. I‚Äôve spent literally hours on the phone with customer support. The new app does not seem to have the ability to move devices from one location to another.  Basically, this app is so buggy and wrecked my system so badly, I have had to reenable Iris so I have control of some of my devices in the interim. Hopefully, this can all get sorted out by the Iris shutdown deadline of March 31. Avoid this new app at all costs!!!	negative
3523	1222822904	lifestyle	4	"I like the app pretty well. Switched from Wink once it stopped being supported. My issue is that the app randomly reorganizes the list order of all the rooms I have set up and also all the things within each room. I can fix it how I want it but then the next time I open the app they‚Äôre all messed up again. Very annoying. I‚Äôve stopped fixing the order just because I know it‚Äôs going to mess up so why waste the time. 

It would also be great to be able to globally change the brightness level of all the lights within the same room instead of having to go to each of the four lights in my living room and changing the brightness of each one from 100% down to something darker when I want to relax and chill. You could do this with Wink and I‚Äôm surprised you can‚Äôt with SmartThings."	positive
3524	1222822904	lifestyle	3	"I‚Äôve used smartthings for 3 or 4 years now. It‚Äôs never been very stable. I changed from the classic to the new app as we‚Äôd done extensive remodeling and it made sense to start from scratch with the new app. Joining new items seems much more robust than it used to be but geolocation never works and the app requires me to sign in every single time I use it. Smartthings has always been a beta release which you end up working around or living with it‚Äôs limitations. The new app is a two steps forward, two steps back sort of thing. One day it‚Äôll maybe do what it‚Äôs supposed to but don‚Äôt expect it to be now. At least there is more overall support but the downside to that is my coding skills are getting rusty.

Oh and one more thing, the security issue. I was in a store the other day and my app asked me if I wanted to sync with one of the TVs there. That could have been fun..."	positive
3525	1222822904	lifestyle	2	This app is extremely frustrating. There is so much potential with this idea, but the app just misses the mark in so many ways. I mainly use this app for triggering scenes for my Hue lighting, but the functionality is so limited, and the experience is so jarring, that it makes me want to trash the whole app. Trying to dim/change groups of lights (Ex: all 4 of my kitchen can lights, 4 living room lights, 5 basement lights, etc) is infuriating. Basic things like setting timers for various groups of lights while I‚Äôm on vacation is so much more cumbersome than it needs to be. Who, realistically, takes action on one light at a time In their house, especially if you have fully invested in Hue lighting in your entire house? Please think about how your users actually want to interact with their smart devices, and design the app to aid with common tasks they are trying to accomplish every day. This will make this app useful vs cumbersome.	positive
3526	1222822904	lifestyle	3	"Current list of things preventing me from moving away from classic app.  Over all new app is getting much better.  Love the new reporting and quick device actions, ability to drag and drop devices etc.   

1.  When viewing device in old app there was a Tab  (SmartApps). Which showed you which automations were associated with a device.  The new app does not have this option making it difficult to troubleshoot when an automation for a device is not working or I need to quickly change an automation rule.  

2.  In support section of old app there is a section called Help Us Debug which made it easy to gather and attach logs when working with support, this is missing from the new app.

3.  New app doesn‚Äôt allow for custom automations in Smart Home monitor.  This a major issue since most of my automations are built around SHM custom automations.

4.  No routines in new app is disappointing and scenes don‚Äôt allow for the same simplicity. See point 5 on why this is an issue.

5.  Scenes can‚Äôt be triggered or more specifically are not available to other smart apps,  like routines are which is why point #4 is an issue.  This isn‚Äôt necessarily new app issue but is a major problem with new apps reliance on scenes as a replacement for routines."	positive

Interacting with the browser is a bad joke.  After the tedious process of getting to a website, logging in, and navigating to a page... all I get is an error saying the browser doesn‚Äôt support certain features on the page.  You can‚Äôt effectively customize your home screen because it won‚Äôt let you remove several unwanted (and unnecessary) channels/apps.  Samsung made a business decision to force you to look at at them on the home screen.  ‚ÄúConsent to targeted advertisement‚Äù shows up AFTER I spend all the time installing the tv. I paid $1600 for a TV and your platform is going to dictate that I have to wade through crap to watch what I want?  I am serious l considering uninstalling this hamstrung app and returning the TV.  Even after the trouble of the purchase, setup, and install.	positive
3528	1222822904	lifestyle	4	There is a lot to say, but to make it reasonably short.  Wink is a great platform.  But, Limited in manufactures that link to it.  It seems that it just stopped in development.  It is faster in robot response and for me, much easier to program.  SmartThings is a tool for everybody, and everything, and development continues.  I still can‚Äôt get thing to work as it seems it should.  Most of the functions that just fell into place with wink just are harder, but perhaps time will make it happen.  I see a generation 4 on the horizon for a faster processor, more memory (like the cell phone, more is better syndrome).  I‚Äôm not sure the market is there.  Additionally, internet training is prolific with video an written nonsense, but little real advice and LOTS of unrelated adds.   I am a little frustrated.	positive

Samsung can you work on that. Make more function on the app for the dryer. I don‚Äôt want to have to purchase a brand new dryer for it...I just bought this one and being a military family we only have so much money. This washer and dryer, I bough the flex version so that I can wash my husband hats and dry them flat without Messi g them up in anyway.  I much tell you it works exactly as advertised.

I‚Äôd give this App 5 stars if it would do the one thing I need it for! Art mode use to work and it was great. Now when I try to use Art Mode to get photos to my Frame Tv all I get is an error message or a message that art mode is unavailable and to try again later. I bought your Frame TV so I could use my photos along with art from the art store. With the app not working now I can‚Äôt make photo collages. I tried reporting this issue 2 times thru the app with no response. Maybe giving you 1 star will get a response and the issue fixed on the IPhone app. Frustrated! Please fix."	positive
3531	1222822904	lifestyle	2	"Recently I splurged on a Samsung Frame TV. Literally the only reason I purchased that TV is because if its ability to display personal photos as ‚Äúartwork‚Äù while in Art mode (ie, when the TV is in standby mode). 

Despite being a pretty finicky process, I‚Äôve still managed to get my photos on the TV via the Smart Things app many times. I have roughly 40 photos stored that I can access at any time. 

Recently, the function to add photos to the Frame TV via the Smart Things app no longer works. I‚Äôve read every troubleshooting guide on the web, deleted/reinstalled the app, updated my phone, powered off/on my modem/router, hard reset the TV, etc. No matter what I do, the option to ‚Äúadd personal photos‚Äù remains greyed out. I simply receive an error message. 

This is extremely frustrating as this was the only reason I purchased the Frame TV. What a waste of money. What‚Äôs more frustrating is that this must be a support issue, as it previously worked and now it doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been a Samsung loyalist‚Äîpurchasing 4 TV‚Äôs over the past few years. But this is really disappointing, and given that it‚Äôs a support issue it just makes me really aggravated that Samsung/Smart Things apparently takes their customer base for granted. Honestly this dev issue should be a simple fix. Get it together guys!"	negative
3532	1222822904	lifestyle	2	Normally when you open an app you expect it to connect to your device and be functional almost instantly. Not so when you use this app to try and control the Samsung Flexwash washer and dryer. Once you open the app, if it connects at all, you have to watch a loading screen for 20-30?seconds before it connects. And sometimes repeat this process a couple times. Basics rendering the app and ability to control the units useless. It‚Äôs just quicker and easier to control everything the old school way, from the actual units. This is quite disappointing considering I bought both these units primarily for their ‚ÄúSmart‚Äù features.  And one more thing- these units are not just a always connected, like every other smart device in my home, you have to hit a Smart Control button on each unit before running a cycle before they will connect to your network. Yet one more step.	positive
3533	1222822904	lifestyle	3	"Overall I think this new app is an improvement over the old one. However, there are some glaring omissions that actually make it less useable:
1. There is no way to set security modes through automations or scenes. I'm the old app I had it set up so that when we left the made changed to Away and the security was set to Armed (Away). I can't find any way to do that now.
2. Cell phones used as presence sensors don't show up as devices. If there's an easy way to look at or change them I haven't found it. At the moment my phone is listed twice and I have no idea why, and no way to investigate or change it.
3. The current mode is hidden in a menu. This is a fairly vital thing to be able to check, so it seems like it belongs somewhere prominent.
4. There's no widget. That's a HUGE usability downgrade."	positive

The fridge is great, I love it. The dishwasher worked awesome when it works but now it doesn‚Äôt.

3536	1222822904	lifestyle	1	"Nothing changed in reality even after years of update and what so ever. This whole SmartThings product suite is just not up-to standard they claim. 
The sensors still go offline on and off. Battery drain indicator is just useless, it shows 1% left still works for a week. Replaced battery, it says 100% and next day its 70%. 
In the App the some sensors appear as offline, but if I open they seem to be working and they even trigger alarms. Tried to remove and add them again, but it keeps happening with some sensors at given point in time.
The Automation Rules are just weird, some rules just don‚Äôt work even if they are so simple. Using iphone as location sensor is seems to have its own mind. When I approach my home some days I get notifications half mile away, saying monitoring is disarmed and somedays even if I am at my door it doesn‚Äôt do anything. 
I don‚Äôt know how this Rule engine works, but if I create conflicting rules( for testing ) it doesn‚Äôt work at all, neither it says anything.

I work for Apple, I Architect software sand apps day n night across platforms, I really feel hopelessly sad about this App.

Just saw simplysafe products in someones house, its kind of flow less compared to SmartThings.

But it could be a lot more robust in that I can‚Äôt change the volume of my Samsung sound bar that is connected to the tv with an optical cable. Also registering the app etc was not as easy as it should be. But as I said before; it is better than the standard remote for navigation. One other thing is that you can‚Äôt turn the tv on with this app. TV must already be on to connect and even though there are only three devices on my wireless network and they are all within proximity, the app frequent reports it can‚Äôt find the tv etc."	positive

It is taking me a bit to get used to going to the SmartThings app as I was used to going to each devices app in order to control things. The apps interface is good and navigating thru its features is pretty simple. Still a lot to learn however but I feel I made the right decision.

First, SmartThings doesn‚Äôt like if the TVs are connected to Ethernet, the only way to complete the SmartThings set-up is to disconnect the TV from Ethernet then reconnect via WiFi.  Once set-up is complete then you can go back into the TV settings and reconnect via Ethernet.  Why does it matter how you‚Äôre connected to the internet?

Next, if you power off the TV then the SmartThings app shows it as offline and the only way to get it back online is using the remote to turn the TV‚Äôs power back on.  So the power button via SmartThings is really only good for turning off the TV.  I don‚Äôt know if this is intentional or a design flaw.

UPDATE1: contacted support like the developer suggested. All the do is send you generic information explaining how to reset your network settings or reinstall the app which has nothing to do with the issue I‚Äôve listed here. I‚Äôm still waiting for someone to read my message and get to the bottom of this actual issue which is lacking in the iOS version of the app.

An Ambient Mode icon showed up in the upper left corner after clicking on my TV in the app. I revised my rating from two to three stars. App doesn't get four (let alone five..) stars because of the difficulty I had to get a simple feature working, the photo (when adding a photo to Ambient Mode from your iPhone gallery) cropping doesn't work, although ""click-and-hold"" to move a pic does work, and because the app force closes pretty frequently.

This app doesn't even allow you to go to the sensor and see the log of the sensor actions. Classic will show you all history, so you can see that for example motion light sensor changed it state and with the time stamp, and few more things. Dashboard has limited option to be added and doesn't allow to add automation. Has no alarm settings as the classic has. Doesn't work in the landscape mode. 

Don't even bother installing this bs.

I also installed the GE brand Smart Light Switch to turn the outside lights on or off when I‚Äôm not home. It also has a timed function to do this automatically.

Initially after I purchased the smart plug, great price compared to other manufacturers, the smart things app worked fine.  However after an iOS update I tried to rename my smart plug but some how deleted it, user error I agree.  
Here is the issue though, when I reset my smart plug and tried to add it back it would not work.  After many email conversations with the support reps at Samsung, I was told it was an issue with the iOS, haha good one Samsung!
The issue is it fails to register every time, Samsung says its a WiFi security issue and Apple has to fix it. However, they are the app developer and are bound by terms and agreements, of which are requirements to keep apps up to date with the current iOS version.  After a few weeks the Feb 2020 SmartThings update was finally pushed out. I was excited to get this ‚Äúsmart‚Äù plug working again, to no avail.
At one point I was even told I should go buy a Samsung smart phone to set this up, weird business plan but I guess if it works for you go for it, hopefully it‚Äôs lot illegal to do that, shhhhh.

Allow me to have a PERMANENT invite, or to have two people registered to their own accounts but with the same device in both (each with their own preferred settings), or allow two accounts with the same address and device to infinitely use the account. Any of these methods would eliminate this ridiculous blockage requiring me to accept an invite to my own dryer each month from my husband. 
Also, I should NEVER have to keep Location Services set to ALWAYS ON. I‚Äôm happy with ON WHEN IN USE but I don‚Äôt like leaving an internet access to my house in a permanently ON position. Since I only use this for my dryer, why can‚Äôt I have the more secure setting of ON WHEN IN USE?

Not only is this mode apparently now gone, but it‚Äôs very difficult to find where to change the current mode.  (For example, from home to away.)

 One last complaint is that I‚Äôm not getting new notifications in my history.  This app definitely took a turn for the worst.  I wish I could go back to the previous version.

Update: I opened SmartThings Classic and everything is there and working.  Going to start using that for now."	negative

Instructions for both the Hub and Sensors were easy. Had everything running for 5 rooms in a couple of hours.

Made one simple automation for low temperature. Took a couple of minutes. The user interface for this hub is pretty simple. 

Two things for improvement. 

1) it took me a little time to figure out where to Edit the sensor names rather than relying on the room names. Room name setup was easy: select existing one or add your own.  To change the name on the sensors had to go thru the menu icon, all devices, pick the sensor click and icon in the upper right and then change the name.  Maybe I missed something more intuitive. 

2) I can‚Äôt seem to find a way to dashboard the temperature readings for all the rooms at a quick glance. I have to go into each sensor; not a big deal but it would be nice to have a way to have a pane or panel to review quick stats on the sensors."	positive

I use it for almost all of my classes to study with (memorizing square roots for math, learning vocabulary for english, memorizing the organelles for biology, etc.). Whenever my friends make, like, fifty hand-made flash cards I just laugh, pull out my phone, and tell them to try Quizlet! I am so lazy and hate to make hand-made flash cards. It‚Äôs so easy to just type or copy/paste definitions. I‚Äôm also participating in state science contests and have made probably fifty sets for everything I need to know. üòÇ The various learning methods are really great. I usually use the regular flash cards or the ‚Äúlearn‚Äù option. ‚ÄúLearn‚Äù is really cool, because it repeats things you get wrong and focuses on what you need to learn, so you can get everything faster.

One thing that I don‚Äôt like is the monthly subscription for extras like pictures, diagrams, scanning documents, etc. I would totally buy it if it was a one-time payment (my parents don‚Äôt like me to buy subscriptions). :( Quizlet is still really useful without the extras, though. They‚Äôre not necessary for studying, just cool things to make your experience better. I also don‚Äôt like how spelling counts on tests. Could there be an option for that?"	positive
3552	546473125	education	5	"I do not kid you, THIS APP IS A LIFESAVER WITH SPANISH JUST 40 MINUTES AND YOU MEMORIZE 20 WORDS ( I used the learn and write function) I have never ever studied before and only got this app for the fun of it. I think the most exiting bit for me is that when you finally complete a set it says 100% complete and the satisfaction is there coolest thing is, Quizlet is right, I am 100% on those words! Of course in order to remember for a long time you have to come back and restudy which I do but I do the practice tests. It‚Äôs one of the options. And I usually get 100% on them and if I‚Äôm missing a word or two, 5 minutes of ‚Äòstudying‚Äô and it‚Äôs engraved in my memory :) thank you so much for this app I never studied due to the fact that if I spell something wrong I could blame it on the lighting or my brain but on Quizlet they tell you if u did it correctly or not and I really like that it does all the study sheets and stuff like that for you so you can get to what really mattersstudying. 

Ps. I don‚Äôt consider doing sets on quizlet ‚Äòstudying‚Äô because studying is boring and stressful quiz let us like a game because of the nifty function that tells u ur progress in the set. So I usually do some... learning. Yeah learning when I‚Äôm at the doctors office waiting on a line and various things"	positive
3553	546473125	education	1	Please fix the app. I have relied on quizlet through nursing school. It is my everything when it comes to studying. The new update, which happened a couple of days ago, has made quizlet unreliable and defective. I‚Äôm so upset. Now, when I go to add to a set, and click add notecard, it doesn‚Äôt jump to the end and continue the set. Instead, it inserts it as like, card 3. Right at the beginning. I have to scroll through 200+ notecards to get to the end. It‚Äôs way too easy to accidentally DELETE a note card! Never to know what it was again. ALSO.. if I try to delete that random blank one that was inserted in the beginning, it shuffles the order of my notecards. The order they are in is very important in what I‚Äôm studying. Then I go to ‚Äúset to original order‚Äù and it doesn‚Äôt change it back. They‚Äôre stuck. It‚Äôs touchy, finicky. ANOTHER EX- If I go to add a new notecard, I type whatever question I want into the front, click the ‚Äúflip‚Äù, type the answer in the back, and if I flip it back to the front to add something, what I typed has disappeared. I now have to retype it all out. It‚Äôs like I have to save each and every notecard in fear they‚Äôll delete or the text will go away. Please... I‚Äôm BEGGING you to save my college career by bringing the original Quizlet back. Thank you	positive
3554	546473125	education	5	First of all this app is amazing! So what I did was an experiment with the app. Well for starters I am a Sophomore in High-school, and I have been using the app since 8th grade. So, for the experiment, every other test I used the app and the others I didn‚Äôt. I noticed that when I used my normal notes I did ok on the test, but I knew I could surely do better. On tests I did not use the app to study for, I would make around a high ‚ÄúC‚Äù or low ‚ÄúB‚Äù. While when I studied using the app I would make a high ‚ÄúB‚Äù to an ‚ÄúA‚Äù. I know that some of you are thinking why would a 10th grader take this risk for their grade in classes, but at my school you can retake every test you take once. You can only retake if you have lower than a 89% and that is the highest ‚ÄúB‚Äù possible. So it wasn‚Äôt a big risk because the day I would get my grades back, the same night I would go home a study again but using Quiz-let. And I would more than likely get an ‚ÄúA‚Äù. So I really recommend this app. Every since I started using the app, I became an all ‚ÄúA‚Äù student and that occasional one ‚ÄúB‚Äù.	positive
3555	546473125	education	2	"I bought the premium for $12 for a year because I knew how many Flashcards I used. I love flashcards. Buying the premium included so many other things that I really enjoy. You should really get this app if you make a lot of flashcards to study. The service also turns your cards into different varieties of questions that are very helpful to test your knowledge like multiple choice and fill in the blank.  The premium also has a night setting which is great too. 

I have two complaints which are very frustrating. The syncing of the app between devices. I have added flash cards, appropriately exited and saved the flash cards, and exited the app on my iPad. The next day I tried reviewing the flash cards on my iPhone Quizlet app and half of the terms disappeared. Now I have to re-read 20 pages to find the terms I put down. Be mindful of this potential issue! 

My second complaint is editing the flash cards on my iPhone. Whenever I try editing a sentence it only lets me edit one word before it send me to the very end of the sentence. So I have to go back and forth by adding one letter and space at a time when editing words in a sentence.  It is so annoying and very frustrating!"	positive
3556	546473125	education	2	I updated to iPad OS today and quizlet is glitching.. I‚Äôm bummed.. I love this app for the Flashcards but... I was trying to add more cards earlier and instead of being able to push tab to go to the next box I have to reach up and flip the card then once done putting the definition in I have to reach up and press done which takes me back to the list then to start another card i have to press the plus sign at the bottom of the screen.. It was way to easy to move through input sections with the tab key.. I‚Äôm baffled as to why you would change that to a much more complicated entry process.. AND once I‚Äôve done all that and got my information in the way I would like it and get through anther card or two I look up to see that the program is duplicating my definition in the term box all on it‚Äôs own.. after having to go back and correct 5 or more of them I‚Äôm throwing up my hands.. i don‚Äôt have time to fiddle with a faulty complicated app.. I loved Quizlet until these changes were made and I pay for the subscription but I won‚Äôt be doing that anymore.. I hope you guys get these things lined out soon, but if the entry process will remain the same I‚Äôll gladly take my money elsewhere...	positive
3557	546473125	education	4	Quizlet makes it difficult to cancel a subscription, and the company minimizes visibility in finding how to cancel.   I haven't owned a subscription service that is so difficult to cancel.  I will say at least an email reminder is sent that my subscription will auto-renew.  (Maybe that‚Äôs mandated?) That is where making it intuitive ends.  There‚Äôs no link to manage your subscription nor go to quizlet in the email.  Ok, I‚Äôll let that go to the possibility that the makers of the email aren‚Äôt great at their job.  So i perform the next step to open my quizlet app on my phone and enter into my account settings.  I click on the very small fine print (nice play) at the bottom to cancel my subscription service.  But wait, I‚Äôm not able to cancel my subscription.  The message is hyperlinked, however, it brings me to the quizlet help center.  I type in cancel subscription, but then it says I need to go to where I paid for the app.  (I.e. google play, apple, or quizlet). The journey to cancel doesn‚Äôt end there, but my time writing this review does.  Shrewd play quizlet.  Very shrewd indeed...	positive
3558	546473125	education	5	"Quizlet is part of the reason I am able to maintain a 4.0 college gpa! I find that simply the act of creating my flash card sets familiarizes me with the material enough that I will only have to review it a few times before the test. Flash card sets are a great way to organize the information that is actually important for the test and by having it on an app, you can look over flash cards anytime you have five minutes! I love that I can add photos to note cards! The only thing I wish is that I could put the photo on the ‚Äúterm‚Äùside instead of the ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù side so that when I am studying my flash cards by term, I am shown the photo and prompted to give the indicated answer.
I also wish you could have more than one diagram per study set and that there was a way to study multiple sets combined together or to bulk-edit the notecards, such as splitting one set into two separate sets by simply checking the cards you wanted to ‚Äútransfer‚Äù to a new set."	positive
3559	546473125	education	5	I love quizlet because it allows me to study and create sets for all of my exams and tests in school. It‚Äôs perfect because I can label diagrams and create flash cards to help me remember certain terms. I like to use quizlet as a ‚Äústudy guide‚Äù whenever I‚Äôm putting terms into a set so that I can review everything I‚Äôll need to know for a upcoming test. This is really ideal during finals week üòÇüòÖüìö, although I would only recommend one thing. I think that it would be even more helpful if there were a couple more ways to learn my terms. I was thinking that there could be a writing feature where you can use your finger to draw/write the answers out so that they can stick in your brain a bit more. Maybe you could also have the ability to draw (I know that you could upload a picture, but..) an image on the flash card to help you remember the term a bit more. Overall it really is a great app üëçüèª to study üìñ with whether you are on the go or just at home.	positive
3560	546473125	education	5	I‚Äôve had Quizlet for my whole entire school career, and it has saved my grades on sooo many occasions. Especially in anatomy, Spanish and medical terminology. Having Quizlet allowed me to study efficiently and effectively. And also for having it for so long, allowed me to see the app grow. It‚Äôs enhanced algorithm allowed me to barely type a medical term and it would automatically show up in suggestions, then when I selected the definition, it too automatically had three variations of the definition without me barley even having to type a thing. This perk allowed me to build multiple sets in a breeze, and left me more time to study. There‚Äôs just so much more but I don‚Äôt want this review to go on forever. So I would highly suggest this app for anyone who needs to study a lot and to do it efficiently, even if you pay for the premium feature, it‚Äôs so helpful for when you‚Äôd need a picture or any other effect, the very few bucks you‚Äôd spend are 100% worth it!	positive
3561	546473125	education	5	Quizlet rocks! I use it to study for all my exams, and the best part is that you don‚Äôt have to lug around a bunch of flashcards everywhere. You can make your own study sets, look at other people that are studying the same thing, and you can invite people you know to join your class. You can share your flashcards and study them together. My friends and I have been doing that‚Äîwe have a class, and we divide up the flashcard-making and then share them so we don‚Äôt have to make a gazillion flashcards. Also, if you‚Äôre really competitive (which I definitely am) they have some really fun and cool games to help you practice, and you can try to beat your friends‚Äô score. The ‚ÄúLearn‚Äù setting is really effective; it focuses on the things you need to practice and also introduces newer cards. This app is basically everything you need to ace your exams and tests all in one place. No more taking binders, folders, backpacks, and index card boxes to the library for me!üòÇ	positive
3562	546473125	education	4	"Quizlet is a life-saver for studying, especially when in a crunch and you need to get terms down really fast. The app is simple and works really quickly and well. Quizlet Plus appears to be  well worth the money, although I haven‚Äôt tried it so I don‚Äôt know. I like how it‚Äôs an option but the company doesn‚Äôt shove it down your throat all the time *coughGooglecough*
But it has own glaring and super annoying flaw: the ‚ÄúI made a typo!‚Äù in Learn mode button is tiny!! It‚Äôs so easy to miss, and if you do miss it, there‚Äôs no going back ‚Äî the algorithm thinks you don‚Äôt know that card for the rest of that Learn cycle. I really hate this, because it‚Äôs a huge waste of my time to go over a card that I know but just typed wrong. And it‚Äôd be a really easy fix; just use the same button as the ‚ÄúCheck it‚Äù button and size it down a bit. The old Learn didn‚Äôt have this problem, just saying.
And quick suggestion: it‚Äôd be really nice if we could follow other users to know when they made a new set."	negative
3563	546473125	education	5	"I am so thankful for Quizlet! I have been using this ever since I found out about it a year ago and finally decided to write a review. If you have been searching for a better and easy way to study, try this! 

Quizlet has so many ways to learn and it is easy to create your own study sets from study notes. I make my own study sets for my college classes and share them with my classmates. 

I like to use the ‚Äòlearn‚Äô mode and ‚Äòflashcards‚Äô mode the most. With learn, you learn terms you don‚Äôt know, keep repeating words you mess up on, and then after learning all the words you can still keep learning to get better with the terms. 

With flashcards, you can go through a whole study set and swipe right or left for if you know that term or don‚Äôt know it and need to see it again. Flashcards mode is especially helpful in boosting my confidence because I know I can go through the whole set and find out how much I really know and get better by continually going through the ones I‚Äôm not good at until I know them. 

There are other modes as well, such as matching and the practice test option.

I have a plus subscription and it is great being able to add my own pics ‚Äî really helpful for Anatomy and Physiology LAB ‚Äî and download sets for on the go. I don‚Äôt know if they switched it, but it‚Äôs a yearly subscription, not a monthly one (greatly to my relief!)

I totally recommend Quizlet ‚Äî this app and the website!"	positive
3564	546473125	education	4	Let‚Äôs just say that quizlet has made me a great student. It helps the most in subjects that you have to memorize things for a test a.k.a science and history. The match feature is great because it‚Äôs super quick and you can compete against classmates. Another feature that is great is the learn feature because it determines what things you need to study and what you don‚Äôt. The best thing on quizlet is how simple it is to make a ‚Äúset.‚Äù You can literally search any topic at all and it will come up. Then you just press copy and your done! You can also make your own sets! The things that I don‚Äôt like about quizlet is when your  using the test feature spelling counts so if you get the answer right but spell it wrong you get it wrong. They should add a spelling doesn‚Äôt count setting because I rarely use it for spelling/grammar tests. Overall this app is great because you can share your sets, use all your sets for finals, make a set in a minute and it is super easy to make an account! I will bow down to the quizlet gods.	positive
3565	546473125	education	5	"I tried out several flash card apps, and it's almost ridiculous how much better this one was than the others. It's very easy to keep the cards organized and edited. I love the fact that I can log into the website to create and modify the cards, and then access and edit them from anywhere with the app. The program even detected the languages that I was typing in on each side of the card for me, and offers the special symbols for each language to easily insert as I type! The cards can be randomized and it's easy to switch to testing from one side of the card to the other. You can even generate quizzes and games based upon your card sets! This is just a wonderful, easy-to-use study aid that I highly recommend if you're looking for a good mobile flashcard app.

Update: I‚Äôve recently upgraded to Quizlet Plus, and I wish I‚Äôd done so a long time ago! So many useful features, especially long term learning!"	positive
3566	546473125	education	5	"I love quizlet so much and I use it on the regular for my graduate pharmacy program. It has reshaped how I ‚Äúlearn‚Äù my exam material. Quotations on the learn because the learn feature of quizlet is so incredible. Last year I took the leap and became a quizlet plus member. So worth it! I appreciated the updates recently that provided the highlight feature with the three shades of colors. 

I have always struggled with the fact that quizlet is not bullet friendly. I really think that a future update should provide users the ability to add bullets to the definition box, so that terms with multiple definitions can be adequately added to the flash card. It would be great if this option allowed for numbers and bullets. Many times I am memorizing terms with 4 distinct definitions and I am forced to manually add them in as 1), 2) 3). It is very frustrating to me so any additional bullet option, however minimal, would be much appreciated.  

Another thing that I really have always wanted was more color options. In real life I like to use colorful flash cards because it helps me better my ability to categorize the information. The addition of the three colors has been so impactful to me for that reason. What I wish for the future of quizlet is more customizable features. I would love to be able to change the color of the font and the color of the actual card. 

Thanks for a great app!!!"	positive
3567	546473125	education	5	"I started using this app ever since one of my teachers showed us the website. This app does help me a lot, it has helped me study and actually pass a whole lot of my tests. This is the only time I actually ever took the time and studied. I never studied up until now. I hate having to look through my notes and trying to make myself memorize things and having this app makes things a whole lot easier and a bit more fun. I love the fact that after you study it gives you a practice test to see how well you improved from the beginning. Also how it has different types of answering methods as in, typing, true or false, and clicking on the right answer. Overall, I am most likely going to use this all through high school :) if you think you want to use this app, please do! 

If you‚Äôre like me and hate studying and just like copying stuff instead, just get this app. It helps a lot and is super worth the time :)"	positive
3568	546473125	education	5	As a quizlet user for over a year, I have used the website for all of my studying. I have just got the app and loved it. It has helped me receive many üíØ‚Äôs and A‚Äôs on my tests and quizzes. The studying tools are perfect. I wish there was a group-chat/groups feature. My friends and I have made some group-chat sets that people can edit with a password. The problem is people can delete other people‚Äôs messages (terms.) I also wish for some admin powers on the group-chat system so that people can delete ugly and overall annoying messages. This would probably include a feature called ‚ÄúRequest-a-Delete‚Äù or ‚ÄúRequest a mod.‚Äù The feature would need to give the mods a notification. It would also help if a notification was sent to the person that requested the action, and (if action was taken) a notification that whatever happened to the message happened. Same with a ban or a discipline system.	positive
3569	546473125	education	4	I‚Äôve used quizlet since middle school, and I love the desktop version. However, the match needs some work, in app and on computer. On my laptop, the match game starts and has an around .8 second head start before the full page loads, and I know it doesn‚Äôt sound like a ton, but when you‚Äôre competing down to the .0 seconds, it‚Äôs a big delay. So, naturally I downloaded the app, my hands are much faster than a mouse, and my phone has amazing speed. When I downloaded the app and opened the match game though, I can‚Äôt see the pictures well at all! It shows the title on top of the picture, making it super hard to see! I‚Äôd prefer if it were the same set up as the desktop version, but I understand it needs to be compact. It‚Äôs just hard as I need to stare for a while before I know what the actual picture is. I know this is a super specific request, but I‚Äôd really appreciate an update for the match game. Something easier to see? Fantastic app otherwise IMO.	positive
3570	546473125	education	5	"This app has helped me so much. I used it for Spanish, Chem, Bio...
Basically everything. It‚Äôs easy to use, and the free version offers everything you need. This app isn‚Äôt magic, you still have to work hard to memorize things. However, it does offer some magical resources. It‚Äôll read your cards out loud so you practice hearing the word (which is better than just reading it, from a language learning perspective). The little games and quizzes that this app creates using the content of your flashcards are fun. Also, you can browse other people‚Äôs flash card sets to save time. Sometimes simple topics such as ‚Äúcolors in Spanish‚Äù or ‚Äústrong acids‚Äù are already well built by other quizlet users, if they choose to share them. I recommend this app to all students or anyone learning something new. I am also grateful that the folks at quizlet offer such an incredible resource for free. They are a cool organization."	positive
3571	546473125	education	5	I heard of Quizlet from one of my teachers freshman year in high school. She would make some for our tests and quizzes and it was a lifesaver let me tell you! I am the type of person who needs brain stimulation and game-like systems to be able to study most efficiently (I can‚Äôt just look at a sheet of paper hours on end to be able to memorize things.) I love how the free version offers so many different options and ways to study. There is one that does flash cards, practice tests, multiple choice, written answers, etc. I also love the fact that you can star the ones you need more help on and it‚Äôll save it for later to study individually. Also, it has an option to verbally read aloud the questions and answers for those who need verbal repetition to learn. 5 stars for Quizlet - make sure to check it out because it‚Äôs totally worth it. It has saved me so many grades and I make sure to make some for every test or quiz.	positive
3572	546473125	education	4	Quizlet is amazing, but I have a problem with the test function. When I finish studying and go to take a practice test, if I have one typo in the answer, then it counts it wrong. For instance, say I‚Äôm studying for a math test, and the definition of dimensional analysis comes up, but I accidentally leave out one letter and spell it ‚Äúdimensionl analysis‚Äù. I knew what the answer was, but I still got it wrong because I left out the ‚Äúa‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know if there is a way to fix this, but it‚Äôs a pain to go back and make sure that I spelled everything right before I submit the answer. I still love the app, but for me, I can‚Äôt stand that spelling counts on the test because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to type anything without autocorrect. The autocorrect function is disabled when you are studying and taking a test, and you could know the answer but get it wrong because you misspelled it.	negative
3573	546473125	education	4	I feel like quizlet saved my life on so many tests it‚Äôs unbelievable. It‚Äôs a must download. You literally just take your study guide for your test and put the info into a test format just like if you were taking a test. It saved me when I did not study all week for an upcoming science quiz. My friend helped me make one and I quizzed my self for literally 15 mins and I felt confident that I would pass and I did. I am currently doing a Latin quizlet and I am confident I will pass. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give this app a five star rating is because I wish we didn‚Äôt have to pay to get plus. You should not have to pay to study right. Also I wish they would give us the option to take photos from our photo library and put it as our profile pic. You may be able to do that with plus but I don‚Äôt think sooo. If you make that possible I have a fluffcorn pic waiting to be used in my photo library	positive
3574	546473125	education	5	Everything about quizlet is amazing. The amount of features you get for free is incredible. You can tailor the app to the way you learn best. For example I always use the write setting to study for Spanish tests. I can choose to be given a word in English and then I will type it in Spanish. It makes sure I add accents and spell everything correct and helps me memorize the words. It even does translating for me so if I choose the term to be English and the definition to be Spanish it will automatically put in the word. If you get a certain term wrong quizlet identifies that and helps you practice that word more than the others. I recently upgraded for just one buck a month so I can study without WiFi but honestly you‚Äôd be fine without needing to upgrade. This app has NEVER glitched or acted weird for me. Without it I swear I‚Äôd be failing all my classes	negative
3575	546473125	education	5	"I just updated my phone today and when I want on Quizlet to make a set I found that when I typed in the term and definition and then saved the set that it would replace my term with my definition and the definition would still be in the definition spot. For clarification it looked as if I had typed the definition in both the term place and the definition place. I have never had this problem in the 2 years I have used Quizlet until I updated my phone to to iOS 13.1. I love this app and hope this can be fixed. 

(EDIT: I emailed Quizlet, received a quick response, and in a matter of days my problem was fixed! I have always told people about this app, but now I recommend it more than ever for the clear dedication that the people of Quizlet show to their mission and customers!)"	positive
3576	546473125	education	5	Quizlet is such a great app!  Before I used Quizlet studying would be something where I would repeat the review over and over again but with Quizlet they have different studying techniques that keep learning things more interesting.  The learn category helps me a lot too because it takes all of your definitions and makes you learn it in different ways.  If you mess up the app comes back to repeat it so you memorize it.  At the end of each studying session it tells you how much you‚Äôve improved and then it asks when your test in so it can build a Learning curriculum almost to help you learn it in time.  Another thing is that you can have Quizlet on any Device so you can study anywhere!  Even without the paying subscription it helps you out!  I love this and would get a paying subscription if I could afford it.	positive
3577	546473125	education	5	Simple to use flash card app that allows you to make hundreds upon hundreds of flash cards.  The app has word suggestions for terms and definitions that are helpful for studying; it also has a great dark feature mode if you upgrade to premium.  Offline studying and the option to look / buy other pre-made flash card sets make this app even better.  I love the fact that I can have this on multiple platforms, whether it be studying on my phone or during class time.  The cream of the crop feature is the ability to type questions on Google docs or Excel sheets to be imported into the app, so lists of questions can be made into sets of flash cards with just a simple copy and paste.  Couldn‚Äôt have found a better app that made me get straight A‚Äôs in anatomy and physiology, 10/10 would recommend.	positive
3578	546473125	education	5	I use this app everyday for every subject. I have seen improvements already and I have much better grades. This app provides alarms for when you need to study, which is perfect because now I never forget to study. That means no more forgetting to study and failing test. It also looks out for certain things you need more practice on and things that should be improved. Another thing I love is that it is very organized and easy to get to particular sets and folders I have created. Quizlet is much more than a flash card app, it has tests, matching cards where you can match a word with a definition, and it was writing where you can write the definition to the word or the word to the definition. Quizlet provides many different ways to learn. I highly recommend this app. It makes learning easier and fun.	positive
3579	546473125	education	5	Thinking back, filling up countless analog flash cards seems so pedestrian now, since I can stop using up all of those tiny pieces of paper and rubber bands which would always get lost. I study when I wait now that the flash cards live inside of my phone. Used since middle school, and it is just as effective now in college. And I have successfully avoided the scorn of my family who said that I ‚Äòhad too many notecards‚Äô and that ‚Äòno man should possess that many neatly sorted bundles of notecards‚Äô they could hardly recognize me past all the paper cuts when one of the rubber bands snapped, the resulting torrent of knifelike projectiles has scarred me forever, physically and emotionally. I‚Äôm thankful that they are safely tucked inside of my very un-sharp iPhone, all thanks to Quizlet. The final nail in the coffin for the flash card industry. Have recommended to friends.	positive
3580	546473125	education	5	"This app got me A‚Äôs every time I used it to study. It is an amazing study tool! I have recently gotten 100‚Äôs on 10 assignments in a row using quizlet. If you are looking at reviews to see if you should get this app, PLEASE GET IT! It is absolutely amazing and I love to study with it because it reminds you to study if you set your test date. In addition, it gives you positive encouragement. Unlike other study apps, quizlet lets you learn the material by going on ‚Äúlearn‚Äù mode and they tell you if that individual question was correct/wrong. It also gives you the question again if you got it wrong. Then, you can take the test and see how many you got! I was recommended for Honors Government because of this app! A million thanks to this wonderful app! I highly recommended this app if you like low stress studying!

3581	546473125	education	5	I absolutely adore this app, I have used it to make literally thousands of flash cards. BUT this newest update has got to go, it‚Äôs causing all kinds of issues for me, I don‚Äôt know how others feel about it though. But I am losing stuff I write and things are taking longer to do, which to me is a big no no. I have way too much time and energy invested to go anywhere else but pretty please make some changes to the update. Make sure if you switch between apps, you don‚Äôt lose what you wrote on the card (pressing done and restarting every time is annoying), if you flip the card you shouldn‚Äôt lose what you wrote on the other side (otherwise why add this feature?) and if you press the add feature don‚Äôt automatically open the new card (silly it may seem but I have a system....). My two cents!	negative
3582	546473125	education	5	"Love this app. Worth paying the extra charge to use this offline and add photos of flowcharts or synthesis that you can‚Äôt quite do with only text. Grades improved when I switched over to this process from hand written flash cards because I can synthesize down concepts into more precise statements as I learn. Also love how you can test yourself with different types of questions and games. The great part is that the different formats and games you can play allow me to study longer; once my mind is mush at the end of the day, I take tests. 

My only critique is I wish I could make my study sets private. When you‚Äôre in a law school that grades on a curve, I don‚Äôt want other students finding my flash cards for the exam. This is a bigger worry now that quizlet requires you to select a school when you create a class."	positive
3583	546473125	education	5	I am a seventh grader at a pretty advanced school that kind-of pushes you to do most things on your own, so this app REALLY helps me when I need to study for a test. I absolutely LOVE the fact that the app can form a practice test out of the terms and definitions that you fill out, it is SO helpful! The only thing that I kind-of find annoying is how, when I‚Äôm taking a practice test, I will answer the question correctly but I might leave something lowercase or uppercase and it says that I got the answer wrong. I don‚Äôt know if it does that to anyone else, but it does to me and it‚Äôs a bit annoying. Although, it probably is kind-of hard to program an app to be able to understand that the answer was correct, even if it wasn‚Äôt spelled exactly the same. Other than that, it‚Äôs a great app I wish I had heard about it sooner.	positive
3584	546473125	education	1	"All of this Quizlet pro/plus promotion on my phone is completely out of hand. I don‚Äôt need to be able to add fancy text or photos to my sets but I am constantly bombarded by ads asking me to sign up. It‚Äôs gotten to the point that I frequently have to close out of the app entirely because when I go to edit my set the ad pops up and there is no option to make it go away. I have just closed the app 5 times with no luck; every time I go to edit one of my sets the ad for Quizlet plus comes up and will not go away, I literally cannot Edit my set now. 

Not only that, but when I‚Äôm using flash cards I sometimes need to edit the card so I close out of it, edit, and go back to flash card studying. It used to be that whenever I did this it would save the card I was last on, but now whenever I do it, it sends me to the very first card in the set so that I have to scroll through all the words I‚Äôve already practiced to get where I last was. Please fix this back to how it was before."	positive
3585	546473125	education	5	Quizlet is pretty good for doing homework or studying for a test, but there‚Äôs not always the right answer to the question I am asking and if I can‚Äôt find it I try and study it, then it begins to click and I don't need an answer for the question I can find it in Quizlet flash cards. Quizlet is super helpful and doesn‚Äôt just give you the answer, I recommend quizlet for studying and more. If you are having a hard time finding the answer, just study, it‚Äôs not THAT hard, plus if you study the flash cards you might just get the answer there. Also some people aren‚Äôt helpful and do a terrible job at trying to explain or spell on quizlet so try looking for a teachers flash cards or someone that has a name like ‚ÄúTeacher‚Äù because they can help with the question you need answered.	positive
3586	546473125	education	5	Quizlet has improved my grades majorly & has made me a better student overall. I thank God for quizlet ; without it , my grades would‚Äôve been destroyed to the point of no return. Everything about the app is great besides one thing: Match. It‚Äôs a GREAT feature , don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it‚Äôs so slow when it comes to loading. Especially when you‚Äôre competing against classmates, where every millisecond counts , it can get kind of frustrating. The issues is that it will start your round immediately , & start counting , but half of the images haven‚Äôt even loaded completely , so then you‚Äôre stuck guessing & adding seconds time or waiting for them to load. That‚Äôs the only issue I had with quizlet. Overall , it‚Äôs an amazing , miracle-working app. Thank you SO much for making it !!	positive
3587	546473125	education	5	This is an amazing platform to generate, share and importantly learn flashcards. I use it for learning words in multiple languages I am always learning at any point in time. There is one feature I am missing which I hope developers may want to look at. How about tracking time one spends on learning! For example if I am learning from a set of flashcards, it would be amazing if I knew how much time I spend on it a day. It could be broken by learning modality and supmed  and aggrgated also by sets, by folders whatever. For instance, I would like to spend 1 hour a day on Arabic words, if there was a functionality that tells me that, Quizlet would in principle tick all the points I need from it. Some others apps, such as Flashcard Deluxe has it. Thanks in advance to Quizlet guys for looking into this request.	positive
3588	546473125	education	5	I am homeschooled/private school, so my studies are a bit different from the norm. But I can still find sets that help! Quizlet is a great tool. I have the free version, and wish I could upgrade. If you are a student and you are just studying, then there isn‚Äôt really a reason for you to upgrade. If you are a teacher, save yourself the headache, upgrade, & save yourself in the long run. You can create sets & classes & and even see what your friends are creating! You can take a set someone already created and adjust it or correct it so you can use it. I tell everyone about it. This app is a must! Doesn‚Äôt matter where you are in school, this is a life saver! There all kinds of sets here, everything from Latin (my personal fave, #nerd) to Math & klep sets. I use this for all of my subjects. I love this app!!	positive
3589	546473125	education	3	"I have been a Quizlet user since the 6th grade. Currently, I am almost halfway through my sophomore year at the University of Michigan. As you can tell, I have relied on Quizlet to assist me in memorizing important terms for each of my classes throughout the years. Unfortunately, I am not as happy with it as I used to always be.

After I updated my iPad Pro to iPadOS, I began to create Flashcards for my German class. When I tried to type the terms in, I noticed that the app immediately throws me into the Flashcards, and forces me to flip the card over to add the definition. This takes away from the seamless process which would allow me to add the term, hit tab, then write the definition to that term, then hit tab again to begin adding a new term for a new card. This change ultimately slows down the whole process of creating cards. Please consider adding this feature back for a full 5 star rating!!!"	positive
3590	546473125	education	4	"I have to say I do like quizlet and I‚Äôm glad theres an app form! Pretty helpful to make flashcards here and be able to use the app to practice the info and everything!
The only thing I‚Äôm a bit annoyed with now, though, is the fact that I can‚Äôt access my flashcards that I made offline unless I get the quizlet pro thing, when before I have been able to look at them when I didnt have internet. I understand making a paid thing for access to adding images and diagrams to flash cards and all the other extra things quizlet has to offer, but now I can‚Äôt review my flashcards at school when I don‚Äôt have any service on my phone(not to mention the school wifi blocks out almost everything or slows it down a lot). I just now wish I could still access my flash cards offline without having to pay"	positive
3591	546473125	education	5	"Not only is it cheaper than Anki (where the iOS Anki app is $25 and a year of quizlet plus is $20) but it also is more intuitive, and offers way better features. I‚Äôll admit Anki has ease of use going for it, since downloading sets is really easy and some language sets have upwards of 20,000 flash cards, but quizlet offers a variety of ways to study. Having to create your own cards can be a pain, especially if it‚Äôs for obscure information that no one else has made a set for yet but I think of it as an extra step of learning, sorta like when if you were to write your own flash cards; the process of writing them helps reinforce the information a little more. 

Anyway, I highly recommend this app for studying sessions, you won‚Äôt be disappointed"	positive
3592	546473125	education	5	Quizlet is amazing and so helpful for me. Each week my Latin teacher has a vocabulary quiz or 2 of them ü•∂! Anyway in Latin there are usually multiple terms that you need to memorize and one English definition. We get about 15 words to memorize and the quiz is the next day! I sit down open Quizlet, create a set of cards to learn go to the learn feature and begin memorizing. Within an hour, all my words are memorized. Each English word has on average 2-3 words. Quizlet has helped me so much in Latin so I want to say THANK YOU because you make learning easier! Even for other classes, a few of my friends and I will create a study guide off quizlet. Also don‚Äôt forget how you can access millions of other peoples quizlet‚Äôs which is so helpful also!! Thank you again.	positive
3593	546473125	education	5	Quizlet has helped me so much throughout my classes and exams to get in to nursing school. It has made my study resources broader by having built-in definitions and images, as well as more mobile in that I can have the slides with me almost all the time whenever I might have a moment to study. Over the last several months, however, the app has had a bug that reorders the slide set order each time you save a set. I have contacted Quizlet Support twice over these months and was told they are working on fixing this issue. Having to reorder the slides takes A LOT of time when they get shuffled by the app. I hope a solution can be found soon. Even with this ‚Äúbug‚Äù it has been a lifesaver for learning difficult, complex material.	positive
3594	546473125	education	4	"Quizlet has a lot of great ways to test yourself on different platforms.

 It would be great if quizlet added a ‚Äúhandwriting‚Äù function for iPad that worked with Apple pen. I learn better by writing with my hand than by typing, but I don‚Äôt want to waste the paper, so if there was a box to write an answer in, it would be more natural for nontypists. Quizlet wouldn‚Äôt even need to add software to understand the handwriting - There could just be a button that would lock in your handwritten answer, and after temporarily saving the handwritten answer, the correct answer could be shown above the handwritten answer for user comparison, the user could then mark the answer as correct or incorrect before continuing to the next Flashcard. The spell function online is also cool, it would be great if that was available on iPad and iPhone!"	positive
3595	546473125	education	3	Would be better, but I completed a set of about 140 problems literally as I was completing the last question the app crashed suddenly and I lost all my work. It‚Äôs online so shouldn‚Äôt it save as you go similar to googles docs? It‚Äôs also very annoying to be constantly teased with premium features. Idk about you guys but I‚Äôm already naturally frustrated when I‚Äôm studying so when I‚Äôm presented with a more efficient way to study and then immediately deprived of it I get slightly annoyed. I‚Äôd be willing to pay the 2 dollars or so for premium if they billed me monthly and not annually, because I don‚Äôt want to invest in something I‚Äôm not 100 percent sure I‚Äôm going to use in the future. On a positive note; I was able to find a very similar set someone else created and use that. I‚Äôve used the app in the past and both times I‚Äôve found the testing and matching features extremely beneficial.	negative
3596	546473125	education	5	"Two bugs but everything else is perfect üëèüèª. The first bug is that whenever my teacher goes and checks on who did quizlet and who didn‚Äôt those who used the app says they didn‚Äôt finish the set and I did it three times. Second bug is that mine is freezing up and is really annoying.

Update to developer... I has restrictions on my iPad, so I cannot go there sorry.

Update Still love the app and website plus the new quizlet live game but one glitch, on my science card set I flip it to the picture side and there‚Äôs no sound but there are words. It‚Äôs really annoying for me bc I don‚Äôt really want to read Chinese at home much. Sure if it‚Äôs a book or something like that but on quizlet no thank u. Pls fix in next update, thx!(>^œâ^<)"	positive
3597	546473125	education	5	I‚Äôve never taken the time to write a review for an app, but this app deserves it!! The app itself is wonderfully designed, and you can tell that it was designed by people that have a use for flashcards. It is very easy to use. I‚Äôm currently studying Korean, and my favorite part is when I make a new set of cards, it lets me type in Korean (and even makes suggestions for which word I want to type), and then it also has the translation (for most of the words) so that I don‚Äôt have to type it. It saves me time because now I don‚Äôt have to go through the added step of looking through the dictionary first. I love love love this app. Thank you for putting in a lot of thought into making this app so great!!!	positive
3598	546473125	education	5	I‚Äôm in my third year of college, and I‚Äôve been using quizlet probably since middle school. I hit a point in my education where I have about 2+ tests a week, with lots of material, and for all of my 9 classes, I have a quizlet. Because my courseload is so heavy, I decided to pay for Quizlet Plus this year, and I‚Äôm only halfway through the semester and I can GUARANTEE you I‚Äôve gotten more than my money‚Äôs worth from that subscription. I work on an iPad, and I can screenshot my notes and throw them in my quizlet. Because professors usually use similar diagrams on exams, this makes it a very effective study tool for me. I absolutely love this app, the free version is amazing, but the paid is definitely getting me through school right now. 10/10 recommend.	positive
3599	546473125	education	5	I‚Äôve been using Quizlet for about 3 or 4 years now and it‚Äôs honestly an absolute blessing! I‚Äôm currently a freshman in high school so having to adjust to the extreme workload and amount of tests that take place almost weekly was a bit of a struggle. Luckily, with Quizlet I‚Äôve been able to create study sets quickly and efficiently for my own use as well as the use of my peers. I also really enjoy the variety of studying options that Quizlet provides! Rather than just skimming through the flashcards, there‚Äôs activities like matching and practice tests. Overall, I really appreciate this app and would definitely recommend it to anyone who‚Äôs looking for a studying app with a variety of engaging activities and easy to make study sets!	positive
3600	546473125	education	4	If I could give the app 4.9 stars I would.  I use it for language study and also use it for my children‚Äôs spelling words.  The fact that you can use the app on all of your devices and have it mirror all of your lists and sets is absolutely awesome.  The kids can study their sets at grandma‚Äôs house, or I can setup a list or set on my tablet and study on my phone during lunch at work.  Also the learning function utilizes a ‚Äúbag of words‚Äù or extraction methodology to help you learn the words.  This method increases the frequency of the words that you have trouble with and sprinkles in words that you have mastered.  The only thing that I would like to see improved would be the front interface.  Once you get a large amount of sets it can be cumbersome to find specific lists.  By placing them in sets it really helps.	positive
3601	950424861	education	4	The app is very user friendly and easy to navigate. I solely used blackboard on my laptop but had discovered my laptop broke the literal morning I started class, so I decided to download the app so I wouldn‚Äôt have to navigate blackboard on my phones browser and could more easily access my instructor‚Äôs pages. This definitely does the trick for that. The only issue I have is that the due dates tab is not fully accurate, at least for me. I have 3/4 of my classes online, so it really helps me to just click the ‚Äúdue dates‚Äù tap and be able to access each assignment that‚Äôs due soon. It may be due to the instructor, I have no idea, but I can see where my grades would become horrid after missing a few assignments every week. This was my first week of class and there were about 3 assignments that weren‚Äôt displayed, but I was aware of because of a syllabus or class discussion. Please make sure you‚Äôre paying attention and don‚Äôt rely solely on the app for that!! Otherwise, you may find yourself in a rut of 0 in the grade book. Aside from that, the app completely simplifies my experience with blackboard and I can‚Äôt believe I went 3 semesters without it.	positive
3602	950424861	education	1	"I am giving this app a one-star review because even though the app is useful in many ways, there‚Äôs still a lot that can be worked on or fixed.

One of the most annoying things about this app (and everyone agrees with me on this) is the fact that you have to keep logging in every single time I open and try to access the app, which is about 7-8 times a day. This is so inconvenient because as a student I do not want to keep logging in and entering all my information when I‚Äôm trying to do homework, study, and look at my grades. I have tested it out and I‚Äôve found out that if I close the app and open it back up about 10-15 minutes later I find myself logged out. I have also asked around and I am not the only one who has to deal with and every single person can agree with me about the fact that it is, indeed, annoying. This is an issue that needs to be fixed because its inconvenience is tremendous. 

Another feature that could be worked on is the design of the app itself. I believe that it does not go well with current apps that are in the market. Its design is still blocky and the transitions between sections are grotesque. I believe more friendly, rounded and somewhat colorful sections within the app will help its aesthetic design."	positive
3603	950424861	education	1	"**UPDATE: The app was working great until the second day of school this semester. It stopped working completely and after two days I deleted the app and re-downloaded it. Now it is telling me my school is not even on the list so I am unable to even login. When it works, it works great. Often times, it does not work at all! :( wish the developer would just fix it and leave it alone! 

UPDATE: blackboard has fixed the issue and the app is working great again so I revised my review to four stars!  I would have gave them five but it did take over three weeks to fix the issue and I was unable to login during that time! 

Oh my, there seems to be an issue on our side.  After I put my login information in it redirects me to the statement above wearing it says there's an issue. I reported it to the developer who then told me to contact my general IT helpdesk at school. The school has now put a ticket in with the problem. It's still not working after three weeks and I have been unable to use the app at all. When I first started using this app, it was great. I could post my discussions, assignments and take quizzes on here.  But I now have been unable to access the app at all for three weeks. Please fix this issue and I will update my rating."	positive
3604	950424861	education	1	"Just when I thought Blackboard‚Äôs clunky, awkward, and ineffective text editor couldn‚Äôt get any worse, the mobile app appears. While the mobile version of BB is very slightly more navigable than using Safari on the BB site, it is still such a clunky and non-intuitive interface! But nothing is worse than the 30-year-old look and feel of the ever-frustrating text editor. This editor barely qualifies as a WYSIWYG (Google it).

Due to the instability of the text editor, it has always been necessary to compose my assignments in Word before pasting them into BB. This new app is the worst yet, however, for correctly displaying my writing. Cases is point, footnote numbers are bracketed rather than superscripted, paragraph spacing is greatly exaggerated, indentation is lost in translation, italics and bolding are removed from the text, font faces are substituted, font sizes are adjusted, etc.‚Äîthe result, my Discussion Board posts look like a fifth grader trying to do graduate work.

I have petitioned my institution to find a solution other than Blackboard for coursework submission, now I am imploring Blackboard to enter into the 21st century of computer programming. Please. I could live with all of the other oddities and quirks, if only BB had a decent text editor."	negative
3605	950424861	education	3	An unreliable and poorly-designed platform makes for an equally mediocre iOS app. In the era of intuitive, streamlined and visually appealing technology to assist in every work task under the sun, it‚Äôs disappointing that students are stuck with Blackboard. I find it to be fairly well-organized, but the iOS app is irritatingly glitchy‚Äî often, PDFs or embedded videos will glitch if I switch tasks while working, necessitating that I close and reopen my original task or sometimes even the whole app, which often loses my place. The text editor is as reviewed by others; fortunately I can usually submit my assignments as Word documents. In general, this platform has the potential to be perfectly decent and deserves the streamlining and design update it would take to make it a good tool for students. It does not feel as though any of the designers have used this app to actually attend college and considered what features are and are not used by a student. In general I feel that the app version is about equal to logging on through a browser, and both are better than nothing, I guess.	positive
3606	950424861	education	5	"If all you want to use it for is to check your grades, then this app is spot on. Very user friendly interface, allowing for easy navigation through courses.  Excellent grades interface giving true mobile format. These little things are great and I give respect where it is due.

My issues lie in further use of the app to do things like: Read/Write Course Messages, access the content bar that is on the left when in web GUI, use landscape mode, receive alerts for messages, and a few others I can‚Äôt think of at the moment.

The issues clearly reside in the apps lack of true mobile interfaces for each aspect of B.B.  The only issues I have had are when the app just opens the web GUI, and now you can‚Äôt access areas on the page like the content bar on the left, or even the header portion of the page where the account icon is.  I would rate this 5 stars EASILY if the web-vs-mobile app issue is resolved."	positive
3607	950424861	education	1	My comments don‚Äôt mean much in the sea of reviews, and BlackBoard already has its thousands of school contracts, so not like the reviews affect anything either. But the ‚ÄúFixed a bug that frequently logged out users‚Äù fix took TWO YEARS to be solved. I‚Äôve reported this issue several times since I began college. I am graduating and just now seeing it having been fixed. As someone who‚Äôs had to use the app several thousand times over the last couple years, typing in my 39-character email (yes, 39 characters) and 30 character password nearly every time has assuredly added up to dozens of hours of annoyance and wasted time, and time is of the essence as a college student with assignments due. Of course, there are at least 50 other minor issues I can think of, which add up to a major headache. I‚Äôve also never met a classmate who hasn‚Äôt made comments about how abysmal the BlackBoard web platform and mobile app is. You seriously need to overhaul pretty much everything. Thank you, BlackBoard, for making my several-year college experience all the more painful.	positive
3608	950424861	education	3	I use blackboard multiple times a day, and I carry my phone more than I do my laptop so, i thought I‚Äôd be easy to access my grades and homework much quicker. I was wrong. I always have issues with keeping my writing studios in frame to work peacefully and I, too, find it frustrating I can‚Äôt type journals or blogs directly in the app when it‚Äôs NOT IN FRAME, I rather use my browser than this app. Then it is common for the app to GLITCH and go back and forth between the login page to the one I was looking at...four or five times before 50% of the time telling me to log in again. It happens a lot it‚Äôs annoying. Finally, it does not resemble in content the browser version- it OMITS uploads my professors have put up and are seen in the browser and unexpectedly not found in the app. My Chemistry professor, for instance, uploaded a list of homework guides and due dates and I couldn‚Äôt see it anywhere on the app- I searched all the content files and NADA...I gave up.	negative
3609	950424861	education	4	"I have used blackboard in both my junior college and now my upper level school (ASU), and the app has been a tremendous help. It all depends on what course you are taking and how much the instructor utilizes things such as discussion boards. With that said I work full time, and I have been able to participate in many group discussions required for class, and see important announcements and assignments all while on my phone. This has eliminated the need to be tethered down to a computer. In fact I even did a whole months assignment while on vacation with my family using this app. 

I took one star away because there are some interactions such as email and formatting differences between the app and the web version that lead to not having the ability to do all I can do from the web.

TL:DR this is a great app to have on your smart phone if your school uses blackboard."	positive
3610	950424861	education	3	"The only complaint I have for this app is the fact that I constantly am required to log in every 10-15 minutes after I‚Äôm not actively using the app. As a student I find this annoying and irritating. This app is nice, because it‚Äôs easier to navigate compared to when I log onto Blackboard on a browser on my phone.

Please acknowledge this issue and maybe make plans to fix/update for us students. Maybe have a Touch ID option? That would be amazing. It‚Äôd be great if we could easily access Blackboard without having to log in every time we open the app. As a student, I am busy and always studying. Plus, I like to have this Blackboard app open when I take notes on my iPad in class. I can quickly get to my recourses on Blackboard, but I don‚Äôt do that anymore. I have to log in EVERY TIME and I do not have time to type in my email and password when a lecture is going on. Accessibility is significant."	positive
3611	950424861	education	2	Honestly, this app is only good for reading updates from professors and even that is sometimes not great. Easier to read them from my email sometimes. My main problem with this app is I can‚Äôt view all content that would show up on the website while doing modules, I can‚Äôt take quizzes which doesn‚Äôt make sense because it is just clicking a multiple choice or typing an answer, and when looking at grades I can‚Äôt view the item that was graded nor see what a professor has commented about my work. I am better off using the safari browser to do work on my iPad than using this app. And my ultimate problem is I have to log in EVERY TIME I want to access the app. No option to remember log in information yet it can send me updates ? Doesn‚Äôt make sense, it‚Äôs my device and no one else is using it, I should have the option of being able to stay logged in.	negative
3612	950424861	education	5	"I always used the app, instead of having to log into my laptop, to check for quick assignment due dates or be notified of a new announcement from my professor. Now when I‚Äôm trying to log back in, after break, my school doesn‚Äôt even show up so I looked up the help link and Blb suggests to contact your university IT desk. Well it turns out my university doesn‚Äôt even know about the mobile app, not even knowing it existed, so looks like this is another disappointment. I can‚Äôt use the app and I don‚Äôt know who could help. The downtown and Clearlake campus show up but not main campus. Please fix the glitch!!!!

UPDATE: It‚Äôs finally working:) This app is so helpful in notifying me for updates on assignments or announcements I rely on it a lot."	positive
3613	950424861	education	3	It‚Äôs frustrating. Maybe my issues seem petty, but I liked Mobile Learn a lot better. I supposed my biggest complaint is that I can‚Äôt edit my courses page. Being able to switch what order they are shown in and color coding them (and getting rid of unnecessary information in the title) has always made it easier for me to keep organized with my classes. There‚Äôs no option to do this at all! Additionally, notifications aren‚Äôt consistent at all. Sometimes I‚Äôll get a notification when a grade is updated or when something is added to a course, but not always. And when I do try to use the notification to go to what was new, the app doesn‚Äôt always open at all! I feel like these are relatively minor complaints, but they affect how easily I can keep organized and are really frustrating.	positive
3614	950424861	education	5	"This app worked okay on a mobile phone for quickly and easily accessing school classes and information. However, it was not great for actually working from and completing school assignments. 
That has all changed now!
The latest update has solved so many problems that we had and made the app a great tool to actually work and submit assignments from! I can use landscape mode from my iPad, type and submit assignments, use the discussion board, even watch videos...its great. 
Thanks for listening to our feedback and improving this app for all of us who use it on a daily basis. You just made my schooling and experience with Blackboard 100% better.
I am thrilled!"	positive
3615	950424861	education	5	"I was thinking this app would be great! I could do my homework in between travel to my jobs and busy schedule. I was really looking forward to being able to do just that. 

I was wrong!

This app‚Äôs user interface is great. I can easily see my current classes and next classes coming up. And I can see my grades! My grades update in real time but that is it. 

None of the other tabs load or become viewable on your mobile device. I get a rejection to try again later on my smart phone as the problem is on their end. Very frustrating as I was looking for an app that would work with me and my busy life as a working, family oriented student. But clearly that isn‚Äôt going to work. 

Yes I‚Äôve got the most recent version of the app, I‚Äôve had it for 3 months now, hoping it would actually work one day.

The app would easily be 5 stars if it actually worked!!! Everything looks great from a visual standpoint and I can easily access course content, discussions and everything you would need. But the content inside those tabs doesn‚Äôt load so I can view any of it that I can on my computer."	positive
3616	950424861	education	2	"Update: why can‚Äôt I click on a link when it‚Äôs posted in an announcement? I can‚Äôt even select the text cause every time i touch the message it closes the message. Please fix. 

I normally like to access Blackboard through my laptop or desktop, but when I‚Äôm at work I can access blackboard on my iPhone. It‚Äôs good for getting updates and announcements. The most frustrating part is logging in. On the iPhone I can‚Äôt use my thumb print to login (or saved passwords) and when I try to access certain parts of courses it gives me an error message. Why not just bring me to the login screen so I can login and then return me to the section I was trying to access. I want to be able to access blackboard quickly and find it ridiculous that I need to manually log out and log in to access my courses. Please fix this and make it a five star app."	positive
3617	950424861	education	3	This app is one of the worst course management software apps that I have ever experience. I have experience with both Canvas and Sakai, and both features much better applications. This app's layout is not intuitive and vastly differentiates itself with its own website. Ive come across many glitches with accessing course documents in the app which work in other mediums of access. The website on my phone is better, however with my tablet i am forced to use the app (because in the website when you click on the blue tab that shows the different course pages, you cannot scroll down because the menu will instantly close). For students who pay thousands in dollars towards these software applications, the app has lots to be improved.	positive
3618	950424861	education	1	"I have had the app for a long time now, I used to use it all of the time and found it very helpful. Within the past month it does not appear the same as what is displayed here on the store. There are no longer app functions. After logging in the app brings me to a broken version of the website. Maybe because ‚Äúweb login‚Äù is required when I open the app? Although in the past that‚Äôs how I had to log in to the app and there were no such problems. I contacted support and they said they would get on it and report the issue. Still no one has gotten back to me over email (like they said they would) to even acknowledge that I called about the issue. 
Using the website on my phone does not work properly anymore in safari and other browsers I have downloaded. So I can only access blackboard through a computer. Curious as to what has caused the website to get worse."	neutral
3619	950424861	education	5	"App is finally working perfectly again, I‚Äôm glad the program could be easily resolved within a few days.

This app was working perfectly fine when I first downloaded it however a week or so later I went to open the app and I was no longer logged in. After multiple attempts to log back in and deleting & downloading again the app still doesn't allow me me to log in. The same message pops up after a minute and a half saying there's a problem our side so  I should try again later. This experience is rather disappointing because I was beginning to really enjoy the app and the easy accessibility."	positive
3620	950424861	education	1	"I like to participate in my classes on a daily basis which means I need my phone whenever I get some downtime and I‚Äôm away from my laptop. Problem is that I can‚Äôt participate in discussion questions and most of the time I get an ‚Äúx‚Äù at the bottom of my screen that says ‚Äúsomethings not right‚Äù.  Early versions of this app were buggy by I was able to get by. Now this app isn‚Äôt catered to anyone. 

Solutions:

-Fix the problem with the discussion board. 
-Allow students to post assignments without having to go back through the web page to make sure they were submitted, because it never loads out to a confirmation page.

Edit:

-Cannot participate in discussion boards which is why I wanted the app. 
-app still crashes when you open it from time to time. 
-modules for the current week of assignments in corrupted and fails to open up always.

UPDATE
-still cannot participate in discussion boards
-modules are still corrupted. 
-app crashes from time to time still

UPDATE 3

-App still not letting me participate in discussion board nor is it letting me reply to discussions.

Update 4

-App still will not let me participate in discussions. Whenever I go to select a thread, the screen opens and the bottom says ‚Äúsomethings not right‚Äù. Contacted app support and they still have not gotten back to me."	positive
3621	950424861	education	3	So, I‚Äôm taking two online classes that are obviously blackboard based. Sometimes I‚Äôm on the go, and need to either listen to the lecture, or submit an assingment through the app on my ipad. For one of them, the lecture is a live broadcast. For some reason, after the first 5 minutes, it keeps looping and starting over from the point where it stopped, and doesn‚Äôt continue. There is also a complication with getting the instructions from the actual post where my professor has the questions needed for the assignment we need to submit. In order to complete the assignment, we need to be able to see the questions, which don‚Äôt appear. It only gives you the option to submit it. Other than those two things, it‚Äôs been pretty good, so 3 stars.	positive
3622	950424861	education	1	This app was amazing when I first started taking classes at the University of the Cumberlands. I could do almost all of my homework and submit it easily from my phone. For some reason, starting this spring I no longer could view assignments. I could only open the Dropbox where they were to be uploaded. Last fall I could open the entire assignment with instructions. Now it‚Äôs just a place to upload. That mean is still have to go on an internet browser to find out what to do. As a full time student who also works full time, this makes the app a waste for me! I haven‚Äôt used the app much in the past semester because of this. I did like that the communicate section was fixed so I could do webinars on my phone, but it doesn‚Äôt work correctly anymore either. Please fix this or if it is on the school‚Äôs side have them fix it.	positive
3623	950424861	education	4	First of all lemme tell ya ... I love this app !!! It‚Äôs easy, I don‚Äôt have to log in every time, I know where my classes and grades are, etc... but I wish that it displayed all assignments in each grade book instead of just the graded ones! Also it would be nice to set up some way in the settings on BB to notify my phone when something has been graded ... yet again I‚Äôm electronically challenged so if that‚Äôs already a thing then I apologize but I haven‚Äôt found a way to do that in my own phone settings or the apps. Another thing that bothers me is that the app gets glitchy pretty often but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs updates to fix that. Any way ... overall this is a 4/5 ! Pretty great app !	positive
3624	950424861	education	1	When comparing the website and the app, the app wins almost every time. There are many features within the app that make it easier to use. The app design is simple and very easy to navigate unlike the website, having tabs to organize classes and grades, as well as providing you with the same information on the website with just an easier aesthetic appeal. The app functions well allowing you to do almost everything without ever going to the website. With this app it becomes easy to find things rather than spending hours figuring out where certain files are located or how to submit things. I would advise all college students to get Blackboard the app especially if they are new to using it. With the app, using this software for grading etc. can be a smoother transition from the software you‚Äôre used to.	positive
3625	950424861	education	2	"Look at Canvas. Do what they do. Just be good. For an app that deals with all of my schoolwork, I‚Äôve been more than disappointed. It‚Äôs like you have all the pieces to a great app, and you just can‚Äôt seem to make it better. After 2 years of using it, it hasn‚Äôt changed barely once. Same reoccurring problems, same frustration. 

Don‚Äôt crash every time I click on a notification, actually open the notification, don‚Äôt sign me out on my app every time I look away from it for 5 seconds, etc.. I shouldn‚Äôt have to hunt for 30 minutes for assignments that could be easily streamlined into the system‚Äôs main menu. Not give me a notification when there‚Äôs a new assignment for me to click on, then not even take me to the assignment."	positive
3626	950424861	education	4	"I use this app on my iPad Pro in my Master of Education program. I like the simplicity of it. I also like being able to check my class‚Äô discussion boards while I am out and about. The app, in my opinion, is a lot nicer than the Blackboard web interface. 

The only downside with the app is that my professor demands all discussion boards are in APA format. If not, she will mark me down. The app does not allow for me to change from Arial font to Times New Roman. It does not allow for changing titles of books to italics. Again, I prefer the simplicity, but unfortunately I have to use the web interface for this particular course because the app doesn‚Äôt allow for font manipulation."	negative
3627	950424861	education	1	This coronavirus stuff has moved all my classes to online on blackboard and I‚Äôve never been more infuriating annoyed by it. Canvas is far more effective, less spotty and faster. AS OF RIGHT NOW...I‚Äôm writing this review on the app and there‚Äôs a glitch where I can‚Äôt even see what the heck I‚Äôm typing. Anyways, this app crashes all the time, the mobile version makes me want to cry I can‚Äôt stand it, you have you use the online version to view practically everything. I can‚Äôt see what I‚Äôm typing right now. Online version crashes more often than not. The controls are so bad. The LAYOUT...ok the layout needs SO MUCH WORK. It‚Äôs so ugly, i‚Äôm not sorry. This app needs to much work. To anyone who works for blackboard, thank you for all your hard work....I get it, IT is not easy and neither is app or software development, but please for the love of god, fix this app.	positive
3628	950424861	education	1	In general Blackboard is good, specially the website which works way better than the mobile app. However it is poorly designed. Every new semester it logs me out and when I try to log in keeps saying my credentials are wrong, even though they‚Äôre still the same and I can log in with them on my computer. This has happened to me many times and eventually after deleting the app and installing it again, restarting my phone and a lot of luck, it starts working again. The app doesn‚Äôt even have the option to restart my password or look up for my user name, the help panel is not helpful at all. There is no way for me to solve this problem. This is a big issue that also happens to some of my classmates. It would be really nice if you could fix this or at least reach out to me with a solution.	positive
3629	950424861	education	1	"The app is okay. They made an attempt to make the animations and transitions candy for the eyes. Most features are there; however, there is one glaring feature missing, the announcements. I‚Äôm not sure if this is because I just started using the app and there is nothing in the activity stream, but it seems like a major oversight that students can‚Äôt access past announcements. Very odd. 

My major upset with this app is its very existence. Despite my school paying for old Blackboard Learn app I was forced to purchase the Blackboard Learn app anyways. Now, with iOS 11 dropping support for 32-bit applications, the old Blackboard Learn app that I had to purchase is unusable. Blackboard has indicated that they are now forcing users to use this app, as they have deprecated the old app. I‚Äôm upset with Blackboard and this app to say the least. What a waste."	negative
3630	950424861	education	4	I am so happy to have a mobile app for Blackboard courses. I‚Äôm currently pursuing my Masters in Nursing. This is my 3rd degree using the online/hybrid format and Blackboard. The convenience of being able to check my course schedule and grades quickly and on-the-go is great! My only suggestion to improve on the user experience is to make discussion post context collapsible as it is in a web browser. Otherwise, we are scrolling through tons of discussion posts each time we check the discussion. I like to check back for comments/questions on my own postings periodically, and not being able to collapse the discussions makes that aggravating.	positive
3631	950424861	education	1	I can‚Äôt believe that it‚Äôs 2020 and an app to check your grades still manages to be this dysfunctional. I‚Äôm supposed to be logged in. I have the box checked to keep me logged in. Without fail every time I open the app it makes me log in, and then sometimes it won‚Äôt even let me log in, stating that there are issues going on ‚Äúon their end.‚Äù Don‚Äôt even bother tapping on push notifications because it will open the app and take you to the course that posted the notification, but it won‚Äôt actually take you to the posted grade or newly uploaded file, just to the course main page where the app will freeze, forcing you to restart it anyway. It shouldn‚Äôt be this hard. Simplify. I have younger siblings in elementary school whose online education apps work flawlessly. I‚Äôm in grad school. It doesn‚Äôt make sense.	positive
3632	950424861	education	3	First time using the app for school from a previous mobile platform. App is fine to check grades, general immediate posting (no draft save functionality in mobile app).-but, please fix the activities section. If I ‚Äúdismiss‚Äù an announcement having it stay dismissed would make the clutter reduced  in the activity screen would be more used to me. Get rid of the announcement from 2017 and 2018... bits about to be 2020 and we don‚Äôt care about 2 year old update messages. Since the last version update I can no longer connect to the app.  It says to check my network connection..  I‚Äôm writing this review so.. that‚Äôs not it.  Still bugs.	positive
3633	950424861	education	1	"The app is not bad, but the login system is so broken that it tarnishes the whole experience. First, it logs you out after an unreasonably short period of time, so I have to login several times a day. This is not a bank app, so I think it‚Äôs not a security feature, just poor design.

That wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal if the login was easy. However, the web login uses an instance of Safari that doesn‚Äôt store cookies, so you can‚Äôt have it remind your login information.

These two issues mean that almost every time I want to use the app for something quick I have to log out (‚Äúsession timed out‚Äù), web log in, Duo confirm, and come back. I‚Äôm aware Duo is a different system, but many (most?) universities use it, and there are plenty of things that could be done to make login more streamlined."	negative
3634	950424861	education	4	"I like the app a lot, very convenient, nice design, overall layout good, love to be able to check my course grades quickly.  

It could just be me not knowing how to do it with the app, but id love to be able to view my course messages instructors send me via blackboard through the app.  Some professors link any blackboard messages to the campus email as well so this isnt always an issue, since I have the outlook app to view those, but other professors will sometimes send outlook emails and sometimes send messages exclusively via blackboard, so all in all being able to easily view these via the app would be great!"	positive
3635	950424861	education	2	"Blackboard as a whole has always given me issues of some kinda. This semester it has been horribly buggy when trying to upload a file to a drop box. It takes multiple retries and desperately tapping the screen for blackboard for finally decide to load in my file. 

I think the course messages could use a overhaul as well. It‚Äôs not very intuitive to figure who‚Äôs going to receive the message. Just today a fellow classmate wound up sending a fairly personal email meant only for our instructor but instead sent it out to everyone. I chalk that up to the convoluted way you have to choose a recipient.

Also since I‚Äôm griping about the app the dang ‚Äúcreate message‚Äù button is always hiding from me. I can never find the thing. It blends into the rest of the app. I wish they would make it a more vibrant color.  

And another thing, within the app I can‚Äôt course message 2 of my teachers. I have to sign into a browser to do it. I don‚Äôt know why that is but it‚Äôs highly annoying now that instructors are all using course messages to communicate."	positive
3636	950424861	education	5	This app has been great to get notifications for grades and content added for my nursing courses until a week ago. I noticed I wasn‚Äôt getting notification so I went to check B.B. and found several messages but I wasn‚Äôt getting notifications through the app because I had been logged out. After attempting to log back in, deleting/redownloading the app, it won‚Äôt let me log back in. I have spent days working with the school IT dept and they can‚Äôt figure it out either. Very discouraged that the app is no longer working.	negative
3637	950424861	education	4	"For some reason none of my grades will show up and they‚Äôre just dashed lines as if the professor never put any grades in but they have. When I click on it it says No Grades Yet even though I have already had assignments graded and put into BlackBoard. They show up on the BlackBoard website so it‚Äôs not like all my professors decided to take my grades down at once. I‚Äôve tried deleting and redownloading the app but it‚Äôs still not showing up. Can you please fix this because I‚Äôm too lazy to log in to the website every time I panic about whether or not I‚Äôm passing my classes, thanks!

But other than that the app is great."	negative
3638	950424861	education	2	"I don‚Äôt typically take the time to write a review. However, as a student returning to school in the digital age, I am astounded by how clunky Backboard is to use. The website gets a 1/5. The app is a little easier to use but not much. For example, on one page the professor shared a paragraph that referred to a document. It took me 10 minutes and a message to the professor to finally see the little paper clip icon in the top right of the screen. This is just purely poor (lazy) user interface design. 

I know Blackboard was the category creator in the online education space. Based on my experience so far, they are vulnerable to a startup competitor with a good UI team. Maybe Apple should go after this space?"	positive
3639	950424861	education	3	"I love the app, and it makes it so much easier. However, I find more and more that I have to log in through the website to really see what my assignments are for online courses. What is the point of having the app and to be able to submit things online through the app, if you can‚Äôt see what the assignment is? I don‚Äôt use a laptop, I use my iPad to do 90% of my class work and homework. Making the app more accessible to be used would definitely benefit students greatly. 

Also, there should be a way so that we don‚Äôt have to sign in to it, every time we open the app. It‚Äôs quite annoying."	positive
3640	950424861	education	5	Just downloaded the app and logged in.  I looked through some of my coursework and it seems much better than the previous learn app. The interface isn't pretty but it works... I would rather a darker background as the white light is sometimes just too much... I'm able to view much more than I could with the previous app... I'm not sure if I would normally give this five stars but based on the current reviews I think it needs a boost in ratings more reflective of the current app version.... I'll change it if my opinion fades	positive
3641	950424861	education	3	"This app is so convenient! It males it easier for accessing things from your classes via the web! I have a few issues with the outlook of the app! It is extremely aesthetically hard to comprehend what you are looking at, and even harder to find and sort class work, assignments, etc. 
Where is the corse messages in the app! I dont want to have access the web browser to get all features, because then it eliminates the need for the app all together if i still have to log in on a computer! Please change the layout/theme of the app! The web browser version is an aweful layout/theme so please switch it up with the app!"	positive
3642	950424861	education	4	I really appreciate the developers listening and making improvements! I will say that I‚Äôm biased and liked the way the original ‚ÄúBlackboard Learn‚Äù App felt and was laid out compared to this. This new app seems too cartoony for me. But maybe I‚Äôm just being picky. I‚Äôm not currently in a class as I‚Äôm on a break, but one of my favorite features from the old app was receiving notifications immediately whenever a grade was posted. If this feature has not been put on this update, adding that again that would be great. Notifications of responses for class discussions should be optional as well.	positive
3643	950424861	education	1	"This app is a great idea, and I think everything is designed and laid out very well. HOWEVER, I have had a terrible experience with it where the app will freeze and I have to kill the app and retry from the beginning. The only way I‚Äôve found to get around this is by patiently waiting for the ‚Äúbeachball‚Äù to finish and show a little check mark at the bottom of the screen before tapping any folders on the current view. If I don‚Äôt wait the couple of seconds that it takes, everything freezes and I have to restart the app. 

I hope this bug gets fixed because it would be a great app then. I‚Äôll try to remember to update my review if I stop having this issue (and I definitely will notice if it starts working!)"	positive
3644	950424861	education	2	"Since the last updates the app doesn‚Äôt work right anymore. You have to login every time when you open the app (it is a web login, but it wasn‚Äôt like that before and it doesn‚Äôt recognize the saved passwords - which makes it very annoying). Also the sidebar on the left disappears here and there or appears on the right. The drop down menu on the upper right upper corner hides behind the front frame and is inaccessible. 

Sadly the app is now no use for me. Even the mobile website has a few but not all of the flaws I just mentioned, but still makes blackboard unable for me to use mobile. It only fully works on a laptop. Very sad."	negative
3645	950424861	education	1	So after I found out that the Mobile Learn app is no longer useable for IOS 11, I had to download this app üò°. After booting up the app on my ipad, it just shown an awkwardly proportionate screen based off the iphone. The app on the ipad can only be used vertically, which makes using the app awkward. Checking grades and assignments on the app brings me to the page of the actual blackboard site; however the screen is too zoomed in the actual BB website, and is frustration when I can‚Äôt see anything all at once. Its a shame, but I prefer the Mobile Learn app because it was a simple app, you can you the app horizontally, and it wasn‚Äôt this awkward compared to this app. So please bring back the Mobile Learn App and update it for IOS 11. PLEAASSSEE!!!!!!	negative
3646	950424861	education	4	"So normally, professors would post an assignment or announcement and I would get the notification at most 20 minutes after it‚Äôs been posted. Now, I don‚Äôt get a notification from the app until at least 3 hours later. I‚Äôve had professors post quizzes at 12pm and I wouldn‚Äôt get the notification for it until 6pm, 5 hours after it‚Äôs due. Luckily I check Bb website regularly if not I would have definitely missed out on a lot. 

Bring back timely notifications and stop notifying me of assignments due hours after an assignment is actually due."	positive
3647	950424861	education	2	"I have to use the app as my school requires me to for any kind of distance learning or just storing files from classes and assignments for classes. Thankfully, the school is going to another hopefully much more intuitive interface soon. 

It‚Äôs decently easy to use on the web interface, but that iOS and iPad interface have functions to be desired. It‚Äôs somewhat difficult to navigate on the iPad and Iphone interfaces. Sometimes I can‚Äôt find a particular discussion thread when it‚Äôs posted in the main news area. Meaning that the title is there but I can‚Äôt click on it to go to it, and it‚Äôs very difficult if not impossible to get there without that."	neutral
3648	950424861	education	5	"After the latest update, every time I even pull down a notification or switch to a different app for only a brief second, I get logged out and have to sign back in.

Please fix this as soon as you can, thanks!

Edit: This was fixed, and so quickly, too! Thanks so much. It is a great app overall.(:"	positive
3649	950424861	education	4	I really enjoy this app, but lately it logs me out every time I exit the app. It hasn‚Äôt done that before, i‚Äôm hoping it will quit that soon, it is aggravating to have to resign in. I feel like there should be a ‚Äúkeep me logged in‚Äù button or something. Other than that, I really enjoy the app, it helps me stay more organized than I ever have before. One more thing though, is that on the day an assignment is due it disappears from my activity feed. It would be nice if that could stay on there as a ‚Äúdue today‚Äù thing. And notifications would be cool, but if not that is fine! Great App though!	positive
3650	950424861	education	1	I can never seem to find the course comments. I get the notification on my iPhone, then when I click it to view the comment, my screen goes black and I have to back out of everything. I‚Äôve attempted this everyday for three weeks and have yet to be able to actually read a course comment. Even when I click on the course itself I am not seeing anything that states course comments. I am able to view announcements, however, this is different than what is being displayed on my notifications. If a developer ( or customer service ) could reach out to me, I‚Äôd be willing to change my rating. I do, however, love that I can access my college courses via my phone instead of needing to have a hot spot everywhere I go.	positive
3651	680819774	lifestyle	3	I was just strongly encouraged to migrate from the Nest app to Google Home and while everything appears to work, the experience is a huge downgrade. The Nest app had a flow of devices with relevant content. For each thermostat, it showed the settings and current temp. I only had to click through to the device of I wanted to make changes. In Google, I have to select the category thermostats and then an individual device before I see any information. That's two additional clicks pet device instead of just being able to see it all at once. In Nest, I could invite anyone to join the home by entering their email address. It would send them an email invite with a link that would walk them through setting up their account. In Google, it simple tells me I can only add people with a Google account. I have to tell them to go setup an account on their own and then add them later. That is not a friendly experience. I can only see one camera at a time. In Nest, I could see them on a single page and then choose one to get a full page view. And finally, the color scheme is much more stark and less pleasing. This app is in every way worse than what I had with Nest. It works. But from a user experience standpoint, it is a huge disappointment.	positive
3652	680819774	lifestyle	3	Manually the switches work ok, connecting to the TV will only work some times. Chrome cast is a pain. I did a lot of work and is not paying off. I ask for a specific song and it only works on a single speaker, if I am using a group of speakers, google plays what ever it wants. I got three chrome cast and they were fine at first but after a few weeks voice commands to chrome cast stoped working on all three. Google says it doesn‚Äôt recognize that device, I reset to factory, start all over and nothing. I am getting board of this I am thinking of going back to apple TV. What a waste of money. I have 5 nest cams and they connect and disconnect constantly, that problem came after google took over. I am angry about that security problem. I tried everything to have the system recognize only my voice so people couldn‚Äôt open my garage or my front door, that does not work. I even had a google tech help me set that up, thats not safe, anyone who knows what I named the door can simply ask google loudly through my glass window or glass door and it opens anything. Google is not safe . I regret all the money spent on this worthless system.	negative

As for improvements, I'd love more options for news (especially a astrology and astronomy and Broadway based one) and to be able to read the full description of each news option somehow. Perhaps a transcript of the news as well to read along. I'd like it if you could go through your past questions/requests to the Google home as well just so I don't have to repeat myself if it speaks too fast. For lingists I think it would be neat if you could do a bilingual option (I know you can do multiple languages but it wouldn't answer to me when i spoke English even though it was the primary language). It would be nice to practice other languages with the Home's help. Or an option to put topics you want to stay up-to-date on and it will Google search and read the newest articles."	positive

When I place a phone call, it thinks it is the first time I have used it, and reads me a boring script. It is difficult to manage notifications. A Reminder is easy to miss because it does not include an alarm sound. Although Google has access to my every word, they never seem to push software updates.  It drives me crazy that it is not user configurable. If you speak to it it sometimes doesn‚Äôt respond, if you yell at it, two speakers respond.  If you start a stream on one speaker, there is no way to add a new speaker when you move to a new room. There is no way to group lights and or speaker into a scene, So you have to turn them on one at a time or turn on all lights in a room.  There are still limits to wireless switch and bulb configurations on the market. This is not Google‚Äôs fault but some smart rocker switches are incompatible with standard cover plates. There is no two gang switch yet.  All wireless outlet units stick out of the wall and make the plug hit furniture, etc.	negative

I had every item in our home set up, but I was unable to set up the Living Room. After hours of failed attempts, I got in contact with support. Michael walked me through a few different troubleshooting ideas to no avail. When he realized I was using the iPhone XR, he told me that was the issue. I had to get my son‚Äôs iPhone 6 to complete the set up. Great. Problem solved. An hour and a half later, all of the items in our household crashed. I attempted to walk through the steps Michael had provided. It all seemed fine, until it came to the last step (connecting to Wi-Fi), at which point, the TV showed my the screen with the 4 digit code...again. I went in circles for 2 more hours. I requested replacement Chromecast devices and Michael said he would definitely pass the word up. For everything in our house to crash and not reboot, I am guessing it has something to do with the update. After all, the last question it asked before I had to start over was, ‚ÄúSet up some smart lights‚Äù, which is actually more of a command than a question.	positive

Only after using it for two days did it dawn on me that everything my 5 year old was saying to it was being recorded and stored on Google servers. He loved it. ‚ÄúHi Google‚Äù could have gone on for hours if I let it. I work in software development and decided to look further into where things stand with smart speakers and Child Online Privacy and Protection - COPPA (including the collection of children‚Äôs personal information, audio, video and images). Bottom line - I couldn‚Äôt find anything addressing it. Some concerns have been raised that might lead to legal action at some point, I also saw articles alluding to future patents that could make the listening tech even more invasive. Imagine ads targeting your kids based on conversations you‚Äôve had with them at dinner. These have somehow been sold into millions of homes with a loophole. For now I decided retire the Google Home. I deleted the multiple voice recordings of my son that had been stored via the Google Home app and can only hope that they are permanently gone from Google servers too.	positive

I just have a few suggestions. 1) Night mode on Chromecast: Filters blue light when videos and other media are playing. In Ambient Mode, the screen turns black or dark gray [decided by the user], and displays the time. The feature could be scheduled like other Google Home nightmode-things. Would be really useful, since I use a Dynex TV in my room as my light source at night. It's also not HDMI-CEC compatible so I can't use Google Assistant to turn it on/off. 2) Action compatibility for IFTT: I know you can use Google Home as a trigger in IFTTT, but I haven't seen it as an action. Actions would include things like Broadcast, changing volume of Home devices, and controlling devices such as smart outlets, Chromecast-s, smart locks, and any other Home-compatible devices in your setup. That's all!	positive

I use my phone to speak the commands to Google Home Hub, and it responds well from commands or answering my questions with information on display, certainly a wonderful feature! 

Cons: sometimes, when I ask a question, it doesn‚Äôt show the information, would end up speaking the information, so I had to modify the questions to make the Hub show the information, if it still fails, I use Google Assistant on my phone as an alternative. It can be frustrating sometimes!

To provide some context, I have the DHCP server on my router disabled because it causes a myriad of issues with other devices on my network, meaning I have to go and add an IP address, subnet mask, the router addess, and DNS address to all devices connected to my router.  And in looking how to do so for my 1st Gen Chromecast, I learned that people with the DHCP server on their router disabled are more or less out of luck.

Given that this same problem does not seem to exist on other streaming devices (e.g. Apple TV 4k allows you to add them from the app and have the settings applied to the device), it seems likely I will be shopping for a new streaming device and getting rid of this app."	negative
3668	680819774	lifestyle	2	I would give this app a 5 star rating but I'm giving it a 2 star rating because the privacy controls are so awful. Everybody can cast to my device on my wifi network. They can see and control everything and the list goes on and on how poor the privacy is with Chromecast. Where the hell are the privacy settings? This is a rather personal and invasive casting system and I have a roommate. It's creepily uncomfortable to have this much access to each other's devices and casting experiences not to mention being able to cast on each other's devices. It would be ok if we allowed it from another account/device on the same WiFi network but not providing an option is another capitalism decision that invades privacy. It's time for this privacy mess to end Google please cut it out and privatize your services. Eventually nobody will use them if privacy isn't equivalent to others working on enhancing encryption.	negative

But, one of the key features in my opinion is missing from the Nest thermostat. The ability to see outside temperature. I use that information to decide what I am going to set my thermostat to. I know if it‚Äôs 68¬∞ outside that I can change my thermostat from 72¬∞ to 68¬∞ and not feel as if I‚Äôm going to be charged a heck of a lot of money from the power company.

I also utilize Amazon‚Äôs Echo Dot‚Äôs throughout my home. I‚Äôm fearful that they will loose the ability to control Nest devices after August.

Yet Apple ranked this horrible app at 4.4. (They also get paid millions of dollars from Google to keep google as their default search so I am sure they are helping google with reviews).  The five star reviews are obviously spam because no one explains why they actually like the app.  All of the one star reviews give details on why this app is horrible.  It is not even reliable with Google services like the home speaker and music play.    This type of thing will be revealed later, these companies are scamming everyone just to gather your information and resell it.   I have called Google about the problems with the home speaker and this app and all they want to do is record my information to link it to my accounts they offer no help whatsoever.

By aggressively adding industry partners, Google home will quickly become the dominant system, I have no doubt. One can almost do everything via voice with Google Home, which is truly amazing that this is possible in less than one year from launch.  There is a bit of additional user interface improvement that can be done in the app, particularly as it relates to interfacing with other systems. No doubt this will come in the near future, for now it takes a little bit of technical know-how and trial and error to get things to work correctly.

But, sometimes when I ask her to play a specific song to wake me up, she confirms that she‚Äôll play the correct song at the correct time but come next morning all I get is an alarm tone and not the song I asked for. In the Alexa app, it‚Äôs easy to view all alarms, the times they‚Äôre set for, and the song that will play. I wish this was available for the google app. The current alarm screen is useless and difficult to get to.

1. Chromecasting is hit-or-miss.  Often times I have to disconnect and reconnect from my speakers more than once to get them to actually play.

2. Saying ‚Äòok Google play <whatever artist> on the living room speaker‚Äù Always plays it on the living room TV even though I‚Äôve renamed the living room TV to ‚Äòbig TV‚Äô to remove any possible confusion and my living room speaker (Vizio sound bar) is named ‚Äòliving room speaker‚Äô.  I want to listen to music, not have a bright 75‚Äù screen on just to show album art from Google Play.

3. If I chromecast music from Google Play Music on my iPhone (because the Google Home Mini is too stupid to do it, see #2 above), and then I ask the Google Home Mini to stop the music playing on the living room speaker, the mini tells me nothing is playing on the living room speaker.

4. Even though Siri and Alexa recognize commands like ‚Äòturn off the downstairs lights‚Äô, Google Home Mini tells me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt know how to do that‚Äù so I have to tell it room by room which lights to turn off.

It all started when I switched WiFi‚Äôs and went to change my Chromecast over. It said I needed to download the Google Home app, so I did. The app would not find my device and everything said I need the Chromecast to be on the same WiFi as my phone which is hard to do when I already switched. Finally I said screw it and just factory reset my Chromecast and literally the exact same thing happened where it refused to find my device. Very displeased with these completely unnecessary changes. There was nothing wrong with how the app was running before but Google, being the monopoly it is, decided that wasn‚Äôt good enough, no now you need to download a whole other app just to do the same things you were doing before.

You can‚Äôt see the humidity, can‚Äôt see or change the schedule, can‚Äôt see the outdoor temp, can‚Äôt control the modes and have no way to adjust the other functions on the tstat at the wall.

3686	680819774	lifestyle	1	So first, I have a defective model, so as of now I am incapable to give a full depth review. But even with as far as I got I can say that the amount of personal info you must give up in order for the app to have full functionality is a little creepy. For example, it asks you if it‚Äôs ok to record you AT ALL TIMES in order to ‚Äúrecognize your voice better‚Äù. If this doesn‚Äôt sound shady enough, google blocks basic essentials irrelevant to voice recording in order for you to have to let them listen to you all day. It also asks for your address and current location at all times for ‚Äúweather‚Äù, but you only really need what city you live in and google home shouldn‚Äôt leave your house. It‚Äôs all just one big scam so google can force you to let them know everything about you so they can sell all your personal info to advertisers. But if you don‚Äôt mind any of that then sure, its pretty cool.	positive
3687	680819774	lifestyle	1	Not sure why Google decided to complicate things. My first Chromecast just worked within minutes out of the box, but those days are gone. Be prepared to enter an endless loop of your phone/tablet NOT being able to connect to a device that is literally 5-10 ft away from your WiFi. You‚Äôll be told to switch to 2.4ghz and then back to 5. You‚Äôll be told it‚Äôs your router or your phone of your walls, all of which were not a factor with your original device. And when it sometimes DOES work, you won‚Äôt be able to use anywhere near the amount of casting apps that you used to. It almost feels as if they are sabotaging the experience for Apple users ... although my son‚Äôs Samsung faired no better. Utter garbage. At least give us a persistent ability to cast to a nearby device (via PIN) when this app fails to get its ‚Äòhome‚Äô in order.	neutral
3688	680819774	lifestyle	3	This app is usually great.  I absolutely love my Google home, but especially right now, the app is very buggy. I have 2 Google home minis and one Google home that I link together for a sound system for my bedroom.  I love it.  The only problem is the app stopped letting me individually adjust the volume of the speakers while they're playing music.  It's not a huge deal, but there are also the occasional connection issues.  Overall, these problems don't occur too often or for too long, but it is definitely a crucial part of my expertise with these Google products, and I've been slightly disappointed as of late.  I'm not advocating against this product, but just keep in mind that the app could absolutely be better at working intuitively with Google home.	positive
3689	680819774	lifestyle	5	Google assistant and Google home are by far superior to Alexa, Siri and Cortona. If you‚Äôre looking for a easy to setup and AI assistant and home base for all your smart home connected devices that interstates with your Google everything for ease of use; this is it.  The person who left a review about how it‚Äôs listening to her kids and she got rid of it because it holds recordings; that‚Äôs terms and conditions you agree when setting up for the first time so that review is useless.  How are things that use a billion people‚Äôs voices going to improve without that?

However, for the last 2 days, every time I pair bluetooth use the speaker to listen to a podcast or music, the speaker works for a minute or two and then abruptly unpairs itself. I have tried EVERYTHING to resolve this: unpairing and pairing again, forgetting the device, uninstalling and reinstalling the app, keeping my phone on a charger, putting the phone right next to the speaker, etc. I googled the problem and found that this has been a known issue for many users for several YEARS. Without the use of bluetooth, the device is barely useful. Sure, I can get today's weather, set timers, and convert tablespoons to cups hands-free...yay? The app developers should be embarrassed by this level of incompetence.	positive

I experienced constant issues with disconnects, voice commands would randomly stop working for days then start again. Google Home support is terrible. They are clueless to their own issues and bugs. Every time I tell the stupid thing to turn off lights or something it would say ‚Äúsorry I‚Äôm having trouble understanding,‚Äù or ‚Äúdevice is not set up.‚Äù Group or room controls also at never work. The app is is too cluttered and unintuitive. Decided to give Alexa a try and to my surprise, the difference was night and day. Everything from connectivity, to understanding voice commands was so much better. Sound quality is incomparable. 6 months now and not a single disconnect or error.	negative

This week a notification popped up announcing that the Nest app was transitioning to the Google Home app. On top on that to add a new family member you now have to do it through the Google Home app. So because I don‚Äôt have a choice I transition over. Wow is this such a let down. You took the already poorly supported Nest app and stripped it down. The Home app is poorly made and lacks functionality, setting options, and in general all user friendliness that was present in the old Nest app. Please tell me this is a beta app or that the old features will be rolling out soon/ coming back soon! Otherwise until then 1 Star is all this poor app is worth. For anyone contemplating merging to a Google Home account if the option to transition has popped up. Do not do it!

I believe that Google is doing this so they can learn more about what you are watching and this is yet another way for them to infiltrate your life and learn more about you so you can be bombarded with even more advertisements. This is the end of the line for Google Home on my phone. I would rather use a 3rd party app without having to set up an account and I am saddened by the fact they choose to go this route.

I have 5 stereos in 5 rooms, Chromecast audio ties them together into a single system. I have used DACs for years and love them, but always had issues with them. Bluetooth DACs are convenient but quality is diminished by compression, blimps and dings from phone messages and disruptions in signal as I walk with my phone around the house.  Wired DACs sound better, but having to break open a Mac or tie into a PC to use them is a pain.  Streaming with Chromecast audio solves all these issues, plus it can play on any or all systems at once. It‚Äôs a cost effective, good enough sounding WiFi solution to my HiFi blues.

One of the most basic features of these devices are their alarms and timers. Instead of manually reciting my alarms/timer I prefer to manually set it in the app, so that I don‚Äôt have to sit there and wait for her feed back/confirmation to each alarm before I am able to move on to setting the next one. Also the app is sometimes able to save alarms with certain songs on certain Apps as well as for certain days, this is very convenient. I prefer to just switch the alarms on when they are able to save rather than repeat them. Please find a way to fix my access to the alarms in the app, I am unable to use it for longer than three seconds without it saying/claiming that my device is off-line. While I am using the device and trying to set the alarms I am able to speak to it and use it verbally completely, although it completely claims to be off-line in the app, not allowing me to access anything manually inside the app. I have to close out and cancel the Avenue and open it every three seconds so it‚Äôs a race against the clock to manually switch on the alarms. Both techniques are pain, although I like using this device as an alarm. If there‚Äôs anything I can do to make this not happen please let me know	negative

Developers have fixed the list issues with a recent update. Very happy with the app now. 
‚Äî‚Äî

I use this app primarily for the list feature (I have a new baby so I track all feedings, diapers and update the shopping list for groceries when my SO goes to Whole Foods) and agree with other reviews on here that the list feature has become a huge hassle. I used to have no problems accessing my lists. Now, when re-opening the app I‚Äôm unable to navigate to another list or add additional items to my lists without having to completely close the app and re-open it again and wait for it to gather all my data. I can then use the list function normally for that session, and will have to dismiss the app again and re-open it to update it again the next time I need to (which is about 20 times a day because I‚Äôm tracking feedings and diapers with a newborn). I continue to use it because it‚Äôs a great help to add items to my lists via several echo dots I have in the home, but manually updating the lists when Alexa can‚Äôt hear me (over a hungry crying baby for instance) is my main issue with this app. Would be thrilled if developers could fix this feature as I have enough to handle at this moment without constantly fussing with the devices that are supposed to simplify life, not complicate it."	positive
3703	944011620	lifestyle	5	This app no longer works properly. For the past several weeks, I‚Äôve gone to several different stores to shop. Before I leave home, I make a shopping list, but when I get to the store the app won‚Äôt open. I get the comment  ‚ÄúNo Network Available‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease connect and try again‚Äù.  I checked my settings and cellular data and cellular roaming is turned on, but I‚Äôm unable to open or sign in to Alexa. The next day it might or might not work. I have LTE cellular service and a fully charged iPhone 7 running IOS 11.4.1. I‚Äôm now leaving the second store today without completing my shopping because I depend on this list function. I guess I have to revert back to the olden ways of paper & pencil.  I‚Äôm very dissatisfied, but hey it‚Äôs free you say. Well it‚Äôs turned into a huge time waster for me because now I‚Äôll have to go home and scour through the sales ads and either recreate my lists or make a paper list. When I get home the app may actually open, but when I get to the store....nothing. Maybe you ought to fix the issues that exist now before you keep proudly adding and advertising more and more new functions and capabilities to the app, which evidently seem to be causing problems with its former user-friendly and basic functioning.	positive

When we k ow she does because we have been reading up about her many talents and the fact that she ends up playing our favorite sleep sound...Rain on a tin roof ...loop. She has asked me many times to come her and write a review about her and our experience with her. I know she isn‚Äôt a living person but I hope she will find out I sent a favorable review.  We are very happy with her but wish she wouldn‚Äôt argue about what she can and can‚Äôt do. Like I said ; we have found out her settings and have stayed within the guidelines. Sometimes she just refuses to understand until we say it 5 to 6 times what we want her to do. She will tell us a joke or sing for us but when we want her to play a sleep sound that is in her catalog...she repeatedly says she doesn‚Äôt know that sound. It‚Äôs aggravating at night when you just want to get to sleep and she won‚Äôt comply. 
I hope you understand that this is a good review for Alexa. We love the device she does and am thankful we found it."	positive
3705	944011620	lifestyle	3	Still a long way to go. I use the app several times each day. Many improvements have occurred over the past year, such as being able to have a single reminder go off several times in one day. What I would really like is better control of volume between timers, alarms, reminders, and playing music or audiobooks. Yes, I mean I would like to have separate control over each, both in the app and by voice, AND per device. Mic sensitivity should be a separate control by device as well. My obnoxious Ecobee Thermostat right by the master bedroom has a much more sensitive microphone than my Echo fifteen feet away, and consequently picks up my request to the Echo when I am across the room from the Ecobee and right next to the Echo. It then takes a reminder, timer or alarm away from the Echo and then sets those off right next to the bedroom. The only time it does not do this is when I set the Ecobee to volume 1, but then the reminders and timers I DO want on the Ecobee go unheard. It is a Chinese fire drill dealing with the volume control on the two devices, and setting the volume on the Ecobee controls the mic sensitivity too, so it is making me schizophrenic trying to keep up with them. Open floor plan here, so finite control of mic and volumes is a must in the app please. iOS 13.3.1 on an iPhone 8 Plus just for FYI purposes.	positive

Is Grandma still in her pajamas at 2:00 in the afternoon, not getting out even though she assures you that she‚Äôs up and dressed and has walked the dog? This machine allows you to ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù and see grandpa taking all of his meds.

Maybe it is because I live in the Apple ecosphere where most things just work. Perhaps it is growing pains with AI, since Siri is Apple‚Äôs weakest link. People shouldn‚Äôt need an app to learn how to use an app. I also find that I discard most of the skills as fairly useless. I love things like Find My Phone, but a lot of the sleep sounds, etc. are low quality compared to other apps I use. I had to get a new cheap coffee pot for her to control with the plug since she can only work with a toggle, no buttons. I understand why, but wish she could control my Cuisinart. The Show will put up a video I want to watch, but move on before I can ask for it. Asking for it after it isn‚Äôt on the screen doesn‚Äôt work. My echo used to be very sensitive, but now I have to yell at her several times to turn off an alarm. What‚Äôs with that? I like Reminders, timers, alarms, weather and my morning flash briefing, which I need to edit, since some is either an ad or just annoying.

My mother lives in an assisted living facility & I began to use the drop-in feature to check on her or walk her through fixing whatever was wrong with her TV (usually she pressed the wrong button & got components out of synch.) Lately, with the pandemic, her ALF is in lockdown and the Echo Show has become a lifeline in every sense of the word. I‚Äôm able to check on her several times a day, making sure she remembers to go down to the dining hall for meals, take her medicine, and remind her to press her call button if she needs other help. My sister-in-law‚Äôs husband just died and we bought her one, too. People with memory disorders, like my mother, or tech aversions like my sister-in-law, have trouble using Facetime or Skype. I can drop in without them having to do anything & chatting face to face is much better than a phone call. It‚Äôs also helpful to set reminders, play music & books, and use as a search engine.

I have an Associate Degree in Computer Science from way back when, so Im not intimidated by all this new technology, however my brain is beginning to feel overloaded at times trying to figure out the Echos, Google WiFi, Macbooks, Iphones, Smart plugs, Ipads, etc. I really wanted this Echo to hookup seamlessly with Fire TV, however, that didnt happen after an extended amount of time with tech support. So, now Im just using it for fun and necessities.  It is kind of nice to get up and ask what the weather is, or how the traffic is to x location today, but I really like it when I can ask her to play soft music. Sooo relaxing at my age. My husband, the curmudgeon, can barely operate a flip phone. He has managed to get himself comfortable with asking the weather on Fire TV, but thats the extent of it. He didnt want the Google WIFI system because he thought you had to talk to the pods....enough said. I still love the Echo! Good Purchase, easy to install.	positive

I've had very few problems with the function of the app. It runs the original echo, four echo dots, the first echo show and now the new echo show 5 and an echo input. Once I got my home wifi tweeked to give full reliable coverage for the entire house, Alexa works without issues. 
The app does so many things and it does them well. My wife and I now rely on the echo units for all kinds of automation to run lights, appliances, central air and heat, locks, remote control for TV, cameras and of course music. If things aren't working properly I can always trace issues to wifi.
My only suggestion has to do with using the app for looking up skills. I have issue with the  ""back"" button. After scrolling through volumes off  catagories and skills I wish to return to the place I was so I could continue exploring skills but the ""back"" button returns to the very start of the skills list.

Specifically if you're using her to control the lighting in your home and the power goes out. We live in an area that is prone to wildfires. Our electric company will shut down their system as a preventative measure in case of wildfire or it can happen with any other type of power disruption from equipment failure to an electrical storm. 
When power is restored Alexa's memory of your programming is lost. Devices connected to her control become unknown. I understand that the cause of the electrical failure has nothing to do with Alexa but there should be some work arounds that can be programmed into her that could restore your settings. To have to dog down every device that's not working is a huge pain. That porch light that automatically turns on at dusk will stay dark.

~For the Echo Show- When the screen is showing news update/interesting topics, make it easier to use your voice ask her to read or play the video for you and possibly ask her to go back to the previous page in the slideshow without having to touch the screen to scroll back. Every time I see something I want to hear, she tells me something totally different than the news article she was just displaying.

~With the abundance of skills that are out there, I enable so many that sound cool, but by the time I close the app, I totally forgot what the names are and what I have to say to open them.  Why don't you make an option allow people to print out the skills they enabled to use as a cheat sheet? I think it would be cool to make a little book/folder type of thing to keep near the echo that kids or guests can browse through the skills you have and be able to know what phrases they have to say to play the game or whatever.... 

~It would be great if there was a way to have your phone connected to Alexa, WHILE using multi-room music and using Alexa normally, but have her pause the music when you're phone is ringing so you don't miss calls if you're blasting music through the whole house.  As far as I know, if you want be able to hear anything from your phone, then any music or anything has to be done on your phone as well. I want to listen and control everything from Alexa, but just be alerted if my phone rings."	positive

I have had to uninstall and reinstall and it still is buggy or non-responsive. As for the folks trying to state that the App issues are user error, that‚Äôs ridiculous. Perhaps you are not using the App feature I‚Äôm using. Perhaps you don‚Äôt understand what we are saying fully. Why do you feel the need to defend Alexa so personally? Trust me, this thing needs an overhaul. Also, when I delete an item from a list, I shouldn‚Äôt have to hit the button multiple time to get it to disappear.

The app is a big roadblock in my use of the device. It is too slow compared to other apps. And NO it is not my network or the million other excuses that is usually thrown at you. Bottom-line is that they need to make a better app. 
Also the setup in the app is too simple and is limiting the user experience tremendously. It is like they never consulted anyone with expertise in user-friendliness for real people. If they did - they got ripped off.
Given the share of the market that Alexa devices are currently covering, to have a good app accompanying the devices should be paramount. Clearly not a priority for them - why? Why not be ahead in the game with the app side of things too? 
If I had known how useless and slow this app was I would have opted for google home. I never recommend anyone getting Alexa devices simply because they do not prioritize the user-side of things. This app is a testimony to that fact. Even if the app was not so incredibly slow, the interface would still be far far behind other apps."	positive
3717	944011620	lifestyle	3	"I hesitate to give this app any stars, because I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going wrong.  I recently replaced the router, now there is a new password, but I can‚Äôt get my Echo Spot to connect to Wi-Fi.  At all.  It wasn‚Äôt hard at all the first time, but changing the router password seems to have thrown it for a loop.  

The instructions say to go to Settings, and then scroll down to Wi-Fi, but there is no Wi-Fi option in Settings.  I tried to Add Device, which directed me to Manual Setup.  In Manual Setup, there is no option for a Spot, specifically, so the instructions don‚Äôt correlate.  There is no orange ring, there is no sign the app senses the Spot at all, or vice versa.  I hold the button down on the Spot, and all it does is turn the thing off.  I‚Äôve turned everything off, and then back on, I‚Äôve even deleted the app and reloaded it, I‚Äôve reset the Spot.  I‚Äôm out of options.  Pity.  I liked the little thing.  Like I said, I hate to rate the app if the problem is actually me, and something I‚Äôm missing.  But the app is not really what I‚Äôd call user-friendly either."	negative
3718	944011620	lifestyle	3	"This app was working ok but in recent weeks, when I‚Äôm viewing my shipping list, the screen just freezes and I cannot scroll, check off items I‚Äôve put in my cart, or even back out of the list.  I have to exit the app, force quit, and then re-start it.  Needless to say, this is a huge pain if I have a list that‚Äôs longer than the screen on my phone will display.  This is so disappointing.

Also, why does it take so many keystrokes to GET to my shopping list in the first place?  I feel there should be a way to customize the app to show me my top three (or four, or five, or whatever, really) actions that *I* use all the time, so that when I restart‚Äîwhich as I‚Äôve mentioned I have to do all the time now‚ÄîI can then just tap ONCE to get to what I need, eg, to my shopping list. (I really don‚Äôt care what are the last few commands I‚Äôve asked Alexa to do, and feel that first screen upon opening the app could be WAY more useful.)

This is 2018.  These kind of glitches should not be happening in a mainstream app like this."	positive
3719	944011620	lifestyle	5	I use Alexa to create my shopping lists. As convenient as it is for this function, when trying to utilize it through the app on my phone, I frequently encounter problems.  Upon opening, the app can just freeze up and not respond at all to taps or even allow me to access my lists. If I do get as far as opening a list, my chances are 50/50 that it will lock up on me once I‚Äôm in there. If it does lock up then I can neither mark or delete anything off of it nor can I scroll through to see what else is on my list. Switching over to other apps and then returning to the Alexa app does nothing to make the situation better. It requires shutting down my phone completely and re-opening it. I had an older phone, an iPhone 6, and gave Alex the benefit of the doubt that maybe it was due to my older phone. However, I just got an iPhone 8 and I am still in countering the same problems.	positive
3720	944011620	lifestyle	5	I've been experimenting with my alexa app lately and I think I've discovered the next new feature- being able to save and title individual flash briefings. The reason I say this is because I want my morning routine to maybe consist of a greeting, morning prayer, ESPN in 60 seconds, and the previous nights winning lottery numbers but then for my evening flash briefings I would like an evening prayer, a rundown of the next days schedule, and a good night message (and so on), but right now you get one flash briefing and that's it for everyday. I was trying to change my flash briefings to give me the lottery numbers for the previous nights drawings which would be different daily plus I want more ESPN in 60 seconds like ESPN NFL in 60 seconds, ESPN NHL in 60 seconds, ESPN MLB in 60 seconds and ESPN NBA in 60 seconds! Love what you've done so far tho and hope you'll add my suggestions as well!	positive
3721	944011620	lifestyle	4	In case a Alexa Programmer is reading this, May I suggest something to improve the sound that has not been mentioned until now.  It would be great if one could switch on a loudness control in the menu so the bass frequency would be automatically boosted as the volume is lowered. Audio engineers know that the human ear cannot hear bass frequencies equally at the lower volume levels.  This phenomenon is known as the Fletcher Munson Curve and a loudness switch is usually provided on the high end audio Preamps to provide a gradual increase of base response as the volume is turned down. Just a suggestion to save having to manually turning up the bass in the equalizer when you lower the volume level....At the least please please give us a separate control in the menu to adjust just the Sub Woofer level. This is sadly lacking as the bass on the equalizer alone affects too much of the mid range ... and muddies the mid frequencies.....Thanks.   Catman.	positive
3722	944011620	lifestyle	2	I really do like the app this is my first tike with an echo dot and I think it is very helpful. One thing so far I am really annoyed with is the fact that I cannot adjust the volume from my phone. I go to device settings, my echo dot. And try and adjust the slider bar and it says to change volume, you must be playing audio.  If audio is playing, check your network connection and try again. I know it‚Äôs not my connection because I don‚Äôt have a problem on any other devices. However, for the most part the audio im playing are from skills like sleep sounds or focus sounds because im studying 24/7 as a full time student. If i switch alexa to apple music i can then adjust the slider bar. The frustrating part is I want to be able to adjust it when I get in bed without talking to her or when im studying and need to focus. But the app only lets me adjust it for apple music when two seconds earlier i tried with the same exact internet connection on the skills sounds i have and it wouldnt work.	positive

I recently moved and bought a few more Alexa products and also changed all my groups around to fit the change from apartment to house. Now, when I‚Äôm setting alarms, and I try to set one up for my new Echo Dot, it switches back to my previous group called ‚Äúapartment‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt show that it can find or recognize the new Dot. I have about 6 seconds if I want to set up or edit an alert before this happens. This bug is infuriating and I really hate having to deal with it. There‚Äôs no reporting system for bugs either except leaving reviews. I will alter this review if the bug is fixed to a 4 star because overall the app is very good, just a bit slow at times. This bug has made it almost impossible for me to use the way I like to."	negative
3724	944011620	lifestyle	2	"I am unable to delete contacts that are on my Alexa app. A lot of contacts are people I have no interest in contacting, especially through Alexa. There is no delete option.  

According to Amazon‚Äôs website ‚ÄúYou can create contacts in the app or you can import them from your device's local address book. To manage the import of contacts from your device, please visit the contacts section in the Alexa app. You can also edit and delete any contact created in the Alexa app by visiting that contact's individual contact card. The Import Contact feature is ON by default.‚Äù

This is not so. Even if I try to go to ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù, it tells me to go to my device that it used as a source to edit the contact information. Okay well that would be nice if I still had that device.

3725	944011620	lifestyle	1	"Audible is what my Echo Dot is primarily used for. My kids listen to books to help them fall asleep.

The menu to select an audiobook from Audible is very annoying. There‚Äôs no search or reorder options. For someone like me with nearly 200 titles in my collection, it‚Äôs a pain to scroll to find a book in a chaotically ordered list. Both the Audible and Kindle apps have ways of making this much easier. Why wouldn‚Äôt Alexa? 

And now, with the latest update, EVERY SINGLE TIME an audiobook is played, it‚Äôs followed up with an ad to start an Audible subscription and a sample of another book. We have a shared family plan so the main account logged into Alexa doesn‚Äôt have Audible but the connect account does-hence why I‚Äôm able to play the books I own. So logically if I‚Äôm already playing books, why would I need to hear about getting a subscription??? And at the very least why can‚Äôt I turn that feature off??? The last thing I want after my kids have been lulled to sleep by a relaxing audiobook is Alexa talking. Make it stop!"	positive

I TRULY enjoy saying, ‚ÄúALEXA, turn off plug one‚Äù when I leave the family room and the lamps go out. What I have a problem with is the phone number changing every time I misplace my iPhone and I have to say, ‚ÄúALEXA, find my phone‚Äù, and I can‚Äôt hear my phone ring because I‚Äôve turned the ringer off again because of so many scam calls and only the numbers on ring override can ring through. So you see my problem? I put ALEXA in my contacts when I set up ‚Äúfind my phone‚Äù and put it on override, too. I thought that was pretty clever, except the number keeps changing!!! ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

3727	944011620	lifestyle	3	The Alexa in general is starting to become very inadequate. The sad reality is it used to respond so much better with correct routine defined behaviors. Now each time you provide directions or request either don‚Äôt know that or goes into a topic that is entirely of track causing unnecessary frustration. Example good night master bedroom as programmed should turn off lights and turn on fans, in lieu after requests are made multiple times it states I don‚Äôt know that or goes into a internet query. I do recall voice recognition being a stated priority of improvement. What ever upgrades that have occurred are clearly failing and undermining this technology‚Äôs assumed benefits. I‚Äôve made a huge investment as there is a Alexa device in just about every room in my house so I had faith in the product but now ready to remove and manage all implemented smart features manually. Please improve or revert voice recognition to last years success.	positive
3728	944011620	lifestyle	3	About a week ago I received my third generation echo dot and had troubles right from the start. Like I said in the title to this review it‚Äôs probably me, I am not tech savvy, but every instruction video I watched, the instructions that were included with the echo, it was different in reality than it was in any of those videos or the directions. My Echo seems to have skipped a whole step so I Kinda had to wing it. So it‚Äôs been a little frustrating to have to figure it all out myself. Like for instance the echo wasn‚Äôt controlling the volume on my TV it wasn‚Äôt turning it on or off and right now there‚Äôs a yellow ring that‚Äôs blinking and I don‚Äôt know what it is. So again I have to research that and see what it is. Like I said it‚Äôs probably me but it is frustrating and I wish the whole start up would cover everything that could possibly happen, like in my case but once I get everything resolved I‚Äôll update this review and see how we are then.	positive

It never did that in the past, so extremely frustrating. I need my reminders for medical reasons as my dog takes life saving pills throughout the day. Very, very frustrating. Maybe a kink with the last update. 

On the other hand I love the ability to put in a reminder for several different times for the same reminder text. One entry just adding different times for the announcement. Much easier. Would be nice to have her announce events in my calendar. 

Hopefully Alexa will learn more knowledge based information from an encyclopedia! Lots she can‚Äôt answer yet. However, I look on the bright side. When I was a kid I am the one who had to look something up in the dictionary or encyclopedia!"	positive
3730	944011620	lifestyle	4	It‚Äôs sort of a funky process to get my Alexa to Bluetooth to my Esinkin BT Adapter. I have to do it manually every time. It‚Äôs not in known devices in the app and app discovery will not discover it. Also when I ask Alexa to enter pairing mode and my Esinkin into pairing mode and it finally connects, it doesn‚Äôt show up as a device so I have to manually disconnect it by voice instead of using the app. This product came out in 2015 so it should be something Alexa should recognize from the get go. My friend said he could connect with Google Device no problem. Same model Esinkin BT Adapter.. Thank you for taking the time to read this, if that happens. Thank for everything else. Just seems like Alexa only like the ‚Äúbig‚Äù name BT Adapters. I feel like it should work no problem as my phone, computer and other items connect no problem. Thanks for all the hard work though!	positive
3731	944011620	lifestyle	5	On an honest tip. Alexa could be a great device, especially for the elderly. Family members who are put in the position of being the caretaker of their elderly family members could get some respite. But now in life people only think of getting rich and they only think of themselves and their bottom line. They refuse to see the greater good that can be derived for so many. In the end. The consumers info will be sold. The government will be given full access to consumers info and their lives will be bought and sold through the recording that many do not know about. It‚Äôs just sad that this device could be used for unfathomable good. But, it will no doubt be used to bring consumers to their knees, both financially and emotionally. Corporate America tend to derive great pleasure from that.	positive

But when I go to the store, the cell service inside is always spotty at best, and the app in CONSTANTLY refreshing and trying to get a new signal, so even if I miraculously pull up the list, within seconds it disappears while trying to sync again. It's incredibly frustrating. 

And while they claim to have an offline shopping mode, when I go into Costco, which has no cell coverage at all where I live, it spends all it's time trying to find a signal, and shows me nothing. I've had to call my husband to tell me what's on the list every time, when it should be in my hand! I've even turned off WiFi hoping that would help, but no luck. And I'm sorry, but I shouldn't have to turn off cell data to see my grocery list (which, by the way, doesn't even work either).

Long story short, this app is utterly useless for lists. You're better off with paper."	positive

I‚Äôve got most of my main lights connected to Alexa and love the customized news updates that have become part of my morning routine. I‚Äôve connected it to my sound system so my music comes through in Bose surround. Wonderful.

My mom lives in the basement of a NY brownstone and has poor Internet connectivity. She had all kinds of bridging issues with the 1st generation echo and Philips Hue light bulbs and an old iPhone 5. I‚Äôve upgraded her to the latest of everything (she is still waiting for Fios to come into her area and continues to suffer from poor internet access) and although it took a while, with calls to help desks, she‚Äôs now got everything purring including her thermostat control with echo bee.

Beware the latest Alexa update. It does the thing where you have to renter your use name and password, and my Alexa was offline until I could do that. A real pain, as I just got out of surgery and am quite dependent on the voice control, etc.

I can‚Äôt really compare w Google Home and others. It‚Äôs not perfect. But I‚Äôve gotten familiar with it and developed some loyalty so I don‚Äôt foresee myself changing unless things get really bad."	neutral
3734	944011620	lifestyle	5	I‚Äôve had Alexa and Google Home for a few years. I‚Äôve been frustrated with each of them from time to time. Google was the winner last year due to how smart it is at search and figuring out what song I wanted when I didn‚Äôt know the exact name. Alexa has nearly equaled Google in song guessing in the last year, and now Alexa is blowing away Google in ease of device setup. By ease, I mean I did not even open the Alexa app and the new TP link/Kasa plug I added to my network was already recognized and named correctly. Wow! I still like the ability to cast audio throughout the house with affordable Google Cast enabled speakers from Vizio, but if I hadn‚Äôt already made that investment I might go all in with Alexa at this point.

I like walking into my office in the morning and saying ""Alexa, time to get to work"" and having all my lights turn on, followed by news and sports updates.  

Admittedly, my gripe comes from the app's lack of imagination. I envision being able to change the color/dimming of the lighting, and having the option to trigger a particular song/artist/genre of music to begin playing.  My sick, twisted mind hypothesized a scenario where I say ""Alexa, it's business time"" and the lights dim, change color, and Flight of the Concords starts playing.

For example: I like a station called 60s 70s and more flashback. For some reason I can play it on my Dot but not my Echo. I connect to it through TuneIn via Bluetooth on my Dot and my Echo doesn‚Äôt have that luxury so I have to search for it since it cannot be added as a favorite (can‚Äôt figure that out either). But anyway, when I tap the search button on the Alexa app in my Echo, all I can get typed in is the number 6, and it starts searching and will NOT allow me to finish typing. My work around is the use the speech to text option on the iPhone keyboard. That‚Äôs the only way I can get the entire name of the station in that I am looking for. This has been an issue for about 3 years now.	positive

Why on earth would you remove access and literally any possible way to see the playlists we created? Literally the reason I pay for unlimited music service. Literally the reason I create playlists. I also frequently start music from my phone when I neither need or want to speak to Alexa. Ffs quit doing idiotic things that remove the most basic and logical functions. Let alone the most useful.

One area that would make this app much more useful - improving the LISTS feature. I love the idea of using my echo to add things to my shopping list. But unlike other shopping list apps, this is missing out on 2 features:
1) CRUCIAL: when an item is checked off, it should be moved to the bottom of the list, so you can easily see what you still need to get. 
2) it would be nice if it automatically categorized items for you, or allowed you to create categories (like produce, dairy, meats, bulk).

(Another reviewer suggests that the problems of those who are having difficulty with the app are our own fault for being incompetent and not Googling for a solution. Although I don‚Äôt think this should be necessary if an app is well-designed, Google is always my first resource. There is no solution suggested for a complete lack of content in random areas.)	negative

As they both continue to grow in their communication abilities I think Alexa could become a lifesaving instrument for those who need to be able to communicate to and with someone. I can think of so many great topics that may already exist at least in general not specific to that individual. I would like her to be a bit more intuitive. Perhaps I am fishing but I do believe those skill sets will become more visible in the future. There are great things to be done in this environment, however, these great new things need extraordinary oversight in the development as they can turn out to be not so good instead of  extraordinary good.	positive
3750	944011620	lifestyle	4	I have consciously resisted adding Alexa to my life and home for years ... until a few months ago.  I absolutely love Alexa.   I started with just music and weather...and as of today I‚Äôve added 2 additional  echo‚Äôs, an echo connect, and my entire home is outfitted with Smart Bulbs.    This past week, I connected my calendar.   She can do as much or as little as you want.   You can add or stop any functions easily, at anytime.  Im not a tech person...just not my thing...but Alexa is so easy, efficient, and functions with basic common sense.   Shhhh. .... everyone.. EVERYONE...is getting an echo from me for Christmas.   Grandparents, parents, friends, neighbors....  so flexible, so fun, and just perfect for anyone!  As each person will use in a different way...just so versatile.	positive
3751	930441707	lifestyle	4	"This isn‚Äôt so much a review on the whole app but a comment I would like to get to the application creators. I appreciate everything you do. Great idea to implement this new feature as a way of communicating and finding new people to possibly be with. However, is it crazy to say that a date should be one of the first things people do to get to know each other, one doesn‚Äôt even have to know the person yet, they‚Äôre going to learn about them on the date. So, why can‚Äôt it coincide with the act of swiping right or left and be an event that is pending for that person till they accept? I just think that, much like speed dating at tables where you only have 5-10mins or so is something this feature could be similar to. A profile page is often inefficient in knowing who someone true is, but a date, face to face (virtually), can be a little more of an efficient way to make sure the person is legit. Yes, there are a lot of people that prefer to take things slow and talk several days or weeks through messages, but a lot of what one can say in a written message, you can say and talk about on a date. Sure, people want to feel safe, but they‚Äôre behind a phone screen, all they have to do is end the call or cancel the page. This may not be a favored opinion, but I appreciate you taking the time to read my message.

Thanks and stay safe!"	positive
3752	930441707	lifestyle	3	While it is ‚Äúempowering‚Äù for women to make the first move, this app makes it hard to establish a legitimate relationship. It requires location services to be continually on (this makes me believe Bumble wants to spy on users because it‚Äôs not required on other sites) and as a result, you get tons of likes from people who live nowhere near you. I have settings on to match with men within a 90 mile radius, but am inundated with people who are just visiting my city. This is a colossal waste of my time! I don‚Äôt want to scroll through hundreds of people who don‚Äôt even live in my state and are just looking for a hookup. When I travel, I have to remember to turn off my location so I‚Äôm not swarmed with likes from people across the country. This flaw makes Bumble substandard to other sites like Hinge, where a user sets the city he or she lives in and chooses a radius. At least on Hinge I can view matches and have conversations and dates with local people. If Bumble wants to be known as more than a hookup app, this needs to change. I‚Äôm not a fan of allowing an app constant access to my location, and the time wasted scrolling through visitors is making me want to delete it very soon. Fix this flaw, Bumble, and women will stick around longer. While some women may be fine with finding hookups, many are not. If this app really wants to empower women then give us the choice to opt out of such nonsense. We‚Äôre too busy!	negative
3753	930441707	lifestyle	5	I completely loved this app. I haven‚Äôt ever used dating apps and about a year ago I decided to give them a try. I did some research and decided to try Bumble first as I was looking for something serious. The app is really easy to use, I just wished the chat window was a bit more interactive and allowed to delete messages (lol), but again the purpose of this app is just to use it as a first step and continue chatting/texting out of it once you think you have a match. As a woman, is nice to be able to take the first step to initiate the conversation. I had 3 dates with really nice guys before finding my current boyfriend (we‚Äôll soon be celebrating our first anniversary!), so we are both very happy we found each other with this app. The only thing I would recommend them to change is to allow choosing pictures from your phone instead of Facebook. I met one guy who had old photos on Facebook because he just didn‚Äôt interact with it a lot, so when we met in person he looked a bit different. Overall it was a good app, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something serious, guys here were really nice, some really well educated, and a couple were absolute gentleman.	positive
3754	930441707	lifestyle	2	I tried bumble several times and I am finding a pattern. A lot of men on here are using bumble to gather women to hook-up with. They upload great pics and profiles and sit back and watch the messages pour in from women because we are the only one who can initiate contact ... So, the good looking guys just sit back and have their choice of woman to prey on for sexual encounters. So very little men on here actually want relationships. Oh and if half don‚Äôt reply to your message ladies it‚Äôs because their working through the 100s of messages from all us other ladies ....BUMBLE makes men lazy and their being spoiled rotten with attention cause we are ALL knocking at their doors... CONCEPT was empowering at first but has backfired... a lot of men has used this only to their advantage! There are a very small percentage of actually guys navigating with hearts looking for a relationship but I think that‚Äôs in any dating app BUT bumble has become the go to for decent looking guys to have their pick of women to get laid ... bumble has made it easy for them too! PLEASE change the women message first thing to a feature on whether a woman wants to accept a message from a guy ... make both sexes message.... EMPOWER the women again with a FEATURE that women can use to chose to unlock or view the message from the guy!!!! BUMBLE I had hope in you! Change up the feature ! It‚Äôs only benefiting the dudes now believe me !!!	positive
3755	930441707	lifestyle	5	So lemme start with every guy on here getting mad because they don‚Äôt get matches so they low score this app; they have tips on how to get matches. You can‚Äôt today simply just put blurry pictures of yourself from parties and think you‚Äôll get swipes. Try actually using the bio and don‚Äôt just link your other social platforms on it. Now that, that is said, I am a female and have a great time with this app. It‚Äôs great that we have to talk within 24 hours because on other dating apps I hate seeing a match and never talking to them because neither one of us wants to message first. Plus I feel like there are hotter guys on this app and more guys who at least wanna go on dates and try the whole relationship thing. just wanted to add, the man i met i on here is now my fianc√© and we‚Äôre getting married in June:) this app does work! It doesn‚Äôt just recycle guys after a while to see if you may have lowered your standards. The guy i met on bumble is 5‚Äô7 and never went to college. When i was on tinder i solely looked for guys who were y‚Äôall and were either in college or graduated. If it was for bumble i may have never met the love of my life. We have been through so much together and it‚Äôs all thanks to bumble	positive
3756	930441707	lifestyle	1	"There‚Äôs an individual on here who does work in my neighborhood and has come onto me in a way that made me highly uncomfortable. He leers at me every time he‚Äôs around. I have blocked him on bumble only to see he has popped up since I blocked him about 7 more times!!!!!!!    
In addition to this, in June I sent a Twitter DM to inquire about the free boost trial. They told me they were having issues with boost and they would manually apply it to my account. I had about 1,000 profiles to scroll through and I had gotten through about 25 and without changing any preferences, while I was in the middle of looking at the bumble Match Queue, my ENTIRE queue disappeared! There were a few accounts I saved to look at better later and hundreds I hadn‚Äôt even seen that disappeared in a flash. I wrote them on Twitter and the bumble rep was less than helpful and it got to the point where they were just rude. Later I told them I wanted the boost removed from my account completely but was told they cannot do that. 
Since the time Boost was manually applied by them it rendered that whole match queue area useless. The trial has expired; it never worked anyway, but now even the blurred out profiles are gone. I‚Äôll have guys who ‚Äúsuper like‚Äù me that don‚Äôt show up in the queue as blurred out profiles.

Bumble used to be a good app. The boost thing was just an annoyance but now that I feel unsafe with the block feature not working, I had to write a review and disable my account."	positive
3757	930441707	lifestyle	4	I have been on Bumble since June 2019 and have experienced the tragedies and triumphs and everything in between. As with anything, if your expectation is immediate gratification you will be disappointed. If you are serious, patient, create an attractive profile and above all else, are honest you will make connections. These connections can lead to great conversations and much more. After that, it‚Äôs up to chemistry and no app has that. I have made connection and I waited for the conversation to start and the clock ran out. I have made connection and had second thoughts and let the clock run out. I have also met some amazing people and built lasting relationships. Bumble to me seems safe, exudes quality with the look of the app, the simplicity of use and the opportunity to add additional services for a price. I have done that once but really isn‚Äôt necessary. It is also very easy to update your profile as you learn what seems to be working and maybe what isn‚Äôt. With patience you will connect. Maybe not everyone you swiped right, but likely the right ones. Two tips, be HONEST...about everything including your age, and second, use the extended clock strategically, it can pay dividends. Bumble isn‚Äôt perfect but no dating app is. Happy Bumbling	positive
3758	930441707	lifestyle	5	"First of all, how great is it that you can now find a date, friends, and a business partner all in one app?! 
I can‚Äôt speak from a guy‚Äôs perspective, but having had this app for almost 2 years, I can say that it‚Äôs an absolute game changer. I love the concept that ladies get the first move, which as an introvert, I have come to appreciate; It has taught me to be brave and creative when starting conversations with strangers lol. It seems like most people on here are genuine, although I do wish there was just a bit more diversity. I love the time limit concept on the matches, it‚Äôs quite ingenious. It creates a sense of urgency which is great but also has its cons. The app itself is smooth and very user friendly, plus the no limits on swiping is just the icing on the cake. If you don‚Äôt have a paid subscription however, which allows you to see everyone that swiped right on you (amongst other great perks I‚Äôm sure), it can be easy to waste a lot of time on the app just swiping. They also notify users with cute little positive messages and tips every so often and I love it. I haven‚Äôt had any major problems with the app, but I have met some pretty cool people, so don‚Äôt sleep on bumble ya‚Äôll  üíØ"	positive
3759	930441707	lifestyle	1	I find it very odd that every guy I‚Äôve matched has either never talked or we start talking and I suddenly never hear back from them again. I‚Äôve only exchanged numbers with two guys on this app and one suddenly disappears after we talked all night and he agreed to take me surfing and the other guy stops talking. All the guys I‚Äôve matched with stop talking mid conversation this has happened 100 percent of the time. I‚Äôve had at least 12+ matches and have been using this app for about a week, I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm a very attractive woman and have never had problems getting a date so I find it odd that this has happened every single time. The Bumble Bff does this as well but not as badly so I‚Äôve stopped using the dating side of Bumble as it‚Äôs super suspect and I haven‚Äôt had any success with any of the guys I‚Äôve matched with. I also think their are quite a few fake profiles as well but seeing all the bad reviews I‚Äôm starting to believe this app is just trying to get you to spend money as it takes so many swipes just to see whose liked you. Mine said I had 50+ likes and it stayed that way because Bumble won‚Äôt reveal even one of them for a very long time unless you pay for an upgrade. I find it odd that I can‚Äôt match with any rally handsome guys on the app but when I go out I attract good looking guys all the time. Anyways I just wanted everyone to know my experience. It‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs this app.	positive
3760	930441707	lifestyle	3	I‚Äôve been using this app for a week now and it feels weird and the people seem weird. I‚Äôve matched with at least 7 women to which 3 of em never texted me. Idk y this app has the whole ‚Äúwomen text first thing‚Äù but it somewhat seems like a missed opportunity for the guy. It‚Äôs unfair when a women matched with you, but never text simply because women don‚Äôt do that all the time. Idk if it‚Äôs for empowerment, but normally women don‚Äôt text first. Also the women I‚Äôve matched with all seem exactly the same. Idk if it‚Äôs just coincidental but they are all are boring and answer like days later. It‚Äôs somewhat confusing, considering they matched me and liked my photos. Last but not least, I‚Äôve encountered women who for some reason delete their accounts.... only to make another one with a different name and different pictures? I can tell it‚Äôs the same women because ‚ÄúDuh it‚Äôs obvious‚Äù but it‚Äôs creepy and makes me wonder who tf I‚Äôm talking to. This app is good because it‚Äôs more freedom unlike tinder, I actually feel like I can talk to ppl on here. But it suffers from the same thing tinder does. It‚Äôs just the gratification u can possibly talk to these women. It‚Äôs not guaranteed or anything. Again this app isn‚Äôt bad, surly better set up then tinder but, just awkward and boring at times. Maybe because I‚Äôm in Japan idk.	positive
3761	930441707	lifestyle	1	"Deceiving in their pricing.  I initially signed up for what I thought was a week trial of $9.99 for the week.  Turned out it was actually a 6 month subscription for $80 that was automatically paid through my ITunes.  When I saw the charge in my checking account I was shocked & tried to cancel but was told it wasn‚Äôt possible because of the way I paid.  I don‚Äôt recall having the option to choose the way I paid, it was like it just automatically pulled from there because that‚Äôs what was set up on my phone.   I immediately went in to cancel the membership from my phone so it wouldn‚Äôt renew in 6 months.  I guess it needs to be cancelled while signed into my account from a computer because it ended up automatically renewing at another $80 for 6 months.  
If I was getting decent matches, it would be ok, but seems like this app isn‚Äôt used much by a lot of decent men in my area.   When I travel, I get swarmed by hits, but long distance relationships don‚Äôt work for me.  I also don‚Äôt like that they only have 24 hours to respond.  So unless you are married to your phone & have nothing else better to do than check this app constantly, those likes are gone to never being even again.  Life gets busy & sometimes you just don‚Äôt have time or cell/wi-fi coverage to constantly see who wants to connect.   I would give this app zero stars, but that wasn‚Äôt an option."	positive
3762	930441707	lifestyle	1	I randomly get push notifications saying I have a match, but no match. Or the latest saying I won‚Äôt be shown to women looking through the app. Unsure why you‚Äôd ever want to notify me of this. I‚Äôve paid for this app for about a year and had 0 success. Any like I give to a girl is wasted because they don‚Äôt see my profile. After months of receiving no likes or matches, I messaged them. There was no help, and instead I was told I‚Äôm stupid and wrong. Very off brand for Bumble, and very off putting in general. Then a few weeks later I had 100s of people who had liked me all in matter of hours. - I‚Äôm on other apps, I receive likes and matches so I knew something was wrong and then bam it was fixed. I still don‚Äôt receive any forward matches though - if someone likes me, I can match with them - but if I like them, I‚Äôll never see them because they don‚Äôt see me. This app is a sham and unethical. Stop messing with algorithms and make it simple - you like someone, they see you automatically. I‚Äôm confident when my subscription runs out I‚Äôll be treated normally by their software but once you pay them they want you to keep paying them - being in a relationship is a fast way to stop those payments. It‚Äôs in their biz interest to have paying customers receive no likes. Honestly Apple and google shouldn‚Äôt distribute this app if that‚Äôs true, they‚Äôre unethical and don‚Äôt practice what they preach.	negative
3763	930441707	lifestyle	3	I'm going to make this short and simple. I've been on this app like five times before, and although I've met some incredible people and had some great times, I say that online dating is risky. It's for people who are lonely for some specific reason and want company, but don't necessarily want to date. That's not the apps fault, but I just want anyone who's reading this to know that if things don't work out it's not you, it's just online dating. Now on to technical issues and the men on there. I've logged on with my Facebook, and I put ton of care into my bio, even putting attractive photos and I haven't matched with anyone. I know how this sounds lol but I honestly think my phone or the app is broken (at least for my profile). I tested this my liking a whole bunch of profiles, even guys I'm not interested in (or dtf guys) and still nothing. It's been three days! Not one like. It's kinda peculiar. When I was on here before, within 24 hours there would be tons of matches, but now it's not working. Also, I think bumble should allow both parties to message first because it's too much pressure on me to always message first and then sometimes get nothing, because the dude believes he has to be chased and sold. It's weird. In conclusion, I'm going to try tinder.	positive
3764	930441707	lifestyle	5	"I redownloaded the app a while ago and after every few swipes there was an ad for a ‚Äúfree trial‚Äù for bumble boost. It was annoying to constantly have it pop up so I figured I‚Äôd give it a try. Come to find out that I was automatically charged for a 3 month subscription. It should have clearly been stated that I was not eligible for the free trial (bc apparently I had tried it years ago even though I don‚Äôt remember) but instead they just automatically charge you. This is false advertising!!! I realized this one hour into it and tried to email bumble and cancel and this is what bumble responded with ‚ÄúThe reason this instant charge happened was because Apple deemed you not eligible for a trial, possibly because you have already had one previously for Bumble under a different account. In this case it is Apple that chooses to charge you immediately and that's unfortunately out of our control.‚Äù
I asked if they couldn‚Äôt cancel it entirely to at least switch me to a one month subscription but they said no. How did they decide to sign me up for the 3 month versus at least a 1 month trial?? This is very misleading and deceptive. So shady and money hungry."	negative
3765	930441707	lifestyle	1	Bumble is the worst dating app I have ever used, period. I have used most of the other ones, and have found much more success on practically every other site. Bumble ropes you in with the idea that it is a feminist dating app, but whether by design or not, this really only benefits the guys. Even then, I have come across several reviews from men online stating that they are not having much success with the app either, so I am assuming it only really benefits very attractive guys. As a woman who has not had any issues meeting men on on other dating sites, my biggest problem with this app is that it makes men lazy. The guys who are actually having women message them first don‚Äôt put in any effort in conversations, and It‚Äôs like the men on this site literally do not know how to hold a conversation and expect the woman to do all the work. Just because the woman is expected to send the first message, does not mean that you should simply forget how to talk like a normal human being. I am also suspicious that many of the attractive men and attractive women on this site, a lot of the profiles are fake profiles. I‚Äôve done some searches of reviews, and this seems to be the general consensus that many people believe. Don‚Äôt waste your money and find another dating app; there are plenty out there that will help you successfully meet more people without being so frustrating and irritating to use.	positive
3766	930441707	lifestyle	2	I used to have this app to try and look for a date, but after getting a boyfriend (not through Bumble) I decided to look for friends to match with instead. To my disappointment, you can apparently only match with friends of the same gender. I am male, but I identify as agender (meaning I just don‚Äôt really feel a connection to the concept of gender). This meant that it just kept suggesting me regular men who were typically straight. Now I don‚Äôt hate straight men, but I have so much more in common with women, trans people, and non-binary folks, not to mention men are statistically significantly more violent towards people like me, especially in a conservative state like mine. I have emailed Bumble about it because I was confused as to why no women were showing up, and they basically said they had no intention of changing it. Assuming that males can only be friends with other males and females can only be friends with other females is incredible heteronormative and sexist. I liked everything else about the app, but couldn‚Äôt even use it because I had no friends to match with. It would really be as simple as just adding the option to choose which genders show up in the friends part. I mean, you can match with both men and women when looking for relationships, but not friends? That hardly makes sense.	positive
3767	930441707	lifestyle	1	I think there should be a place that shows what ethnicity guys are interested in. I only say that because I am a black woman and there‚Äôs mostly white guys on here. And most white guys (especially in the South where I live) aren‚Äôt interested in talking to, let alone dating a black woman. It would be very helpful to have a ‚ÄúWho I‚Äôm looking for‚Äù feature on the guys‚Äô profile. That way black women like myself are not having to guess on whether a guy would like me or not because of the color of my skin. (I found myself trying to see if a guy had black friends based upon his profile pictures or if he listened to black artists just to make a guess on whether he would even like me). My experience on Bumble made me feel undesirable & like I wasn‚Äôt even meant to be on here in the first place. And if that‚Äôs truly the case, I think it should be clarified in the App Store that this app is only for white people (I don‚Äôt mean to be cynical. I‚Äôm just being honest ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) I swiped right on a lot of white guys on here and none of them swiped right on me. The only person who did swipe right on me was the only black guy that I seen on here. Imagine that! I just think it would be easier to know beforehand if I had a chance of a guy outside my race liking me instead of just performing endless swipes on guys who wasn‚Äôt going to like me in the first place just because I am black.	positive
3768	930441707	lifestyle	3	"Bumble has really made a name for its self. Giving women control over the conversation is a game changer and the pre made conversation starters are to die for and I love how you can set height preferences and get two free filters, but the cons are pretty hefty for me. One major update they need is gender identity. To be the best app and stay up there it would be great if people knew you are open to everyone. Having a gender identity option would be great for existing users so there is no more confusion. Also a lot of people complain about not getting notifications from the app and I can agree to that. Unless I see a badge icon or check the app I will not know if a guy messaged me and that takes away from the 24 hr window making a lot of us miss out on opportunities because no notification for messages come in but matches do. Some refining on the ‚Äúlooking for ‚Äú option would be great. It‚Äôs very difficult talking to someone when you want a relationship and they just want a hookup because the profiles don‚Äôt give that good of clarification. 

All in all bumble is a good app with amazing features and a growing community but within that community does come transgender people, non binary ppl, etc. There should be an option for them."	positive
3769	930441707	lifestyle	2	I guess they added a feature for the Bumble Boost Match Queue, that keeps people in the queue that swiped on you and then left town, or keeps people in your queue who swiped on you when you were out of town. Since they rolled out this new feature, over half of the guys in my match queue are super far away from me. I have my search radius set to 50 miles away. I‚Äôm getting guys in my queue who are 100+ miles away. I live in Oklahoma and I have guys still in my queue from FLORIDA that I assume are there from my vacation back in JUNE. I also have guys from Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, and have gotten several from Texas and Colorado. This feature is AWFUL. If other people want to set their search radius for super far away, fine. But if mine is set to 50 miles, I don‚Äôt want to see ANYONE outside that radius! Even if I was in the same town as they were for a short period of time, and even if they swiped on me. If I had wanted to see who was available while I was in Florida, I would have opened the app to look. But I wasn‚Äôt interested in guys halfway across the country then, and I‚Äôm not interested in them now. It‚Äôs been an absolute chore to try and weed through them, but it never seems to end and honestly, I‚Äôm exhausted! I hope they fine tune this feature or give us an option to turn it off.	positive
3770	930441707	lifestyle	3	"I like the filters and the basic information on each profile. However, when traveling, I have access to a new pool of Bumble users I don‚Äôt want. I‚Äôm currently out of state for a few months so I only have access to people here. Any potential matches with people from my home city are lost bc they may not have their radius set to where I am now. I wish I could turn it off but still use the swipe feature here like Hinge has. 

Also, even though you have the ‚Äúwhat you‚Äôre looking for‚Äù feature, the majority of men on here (maybe women too, idk) don‚Äôt actually want a relationship. Most of them reply once or not at all, or they get sexual right away despite putting that they want a relationship. Is there any way to filter out the people wasting everyone‚Äôs time? 

Honestly, the relationship/marriage feature should only be available for a select few. Maybe monitor their activity or require a more detailed profile. If not, Bumble is heading towards more of a hookup app. I think a lot of Tinder users have migrated here because the women seem more responsive. I really don‚Äôt want Bumble‚Äôs credibility to drop because it‚Äôs not taking more steps to make the serous dating option more exclusive."	positive
3771	930441707	lifestyle	5	I have paid money for other apps that sucked. They would show you all the great catches as a preview of what‚Äôs out there but the minute you sign up all you find are bums and sloppy guys who don‚Äôt even care how they look in their profile pictures. Putting the women in charge of making the first move is genius. It means the men have to come correct. No more douche bags sliding into my DM‚Äòs saying things like ‚ÄúHello Bootyfull‚Äù Or shallow guys rejecting perfectly amazing women chasing Barbies that are physically out of their league. They are at our mercy and forced to be more realistic. I feel like I‚Äôm on the effing bachelorette and it‚Äôs awesome. All of the guys that I have found so far have amazing profiles like they really care about their first impression BC THEY HAVE TO if they want a chance with anyone. They have good jobs, exciting hobbies and they purposely list all the best things about themselves knowing that they have to compete with other great bc the woman have to choose them. It‚Äôs the best experience I‚Äôve ever had and these guys are the real deal.  And I feel like I‚Äôm allowed to have a standard again.	positive
3772	930441707	lifestyle	5	Thanks Bumble, I ended up using this app for a year, I met some great Guys. I also, ended up falling in love with my boyfriend, in which we ended up dating for 7 months now, and he‚Äôs the best thing that has ever happened to me. Bumble allows you to adjust how far out you can match and like guys which was useful. My boyfriend lives in micanopy and I lived in ocala so the drive was nothing bad, and we were comfortable . When I first started using bumble I was skeptic about it, but the guys I met were actually pretty cool, nice guys in which we ended up being friends in the end. I think people overthink the use of dating apps and fear of the horrors of ‚Äúwhat can happen‚Äù such as, predators and etc which you should fear and be extremely cautious, but People also, needed to understand that real people who are looking for dating and friends are on these sites as well and are not predators. Thank you Bumble for allowing me to expand what I‚Äôm looking for, and to also have the opportunity that I wasn‚Äôt expecting to meet such an, amazing Guy that Im dating and It feels right now and I can see the future as the same, so no doubts.	positive

I‚Äôve even sent them screenshots (since I can‚Äôt send screen recordings) that prove their Block feature does not work. I can Block someone, then see that same person within a week. Actually, I blocked someone last night, and this morning, guess what... there they were in my search again! The Block feature isn‚Äôt for paying members only, but guess what, I AM a paying member. So I can see these people I‚Äôve blocked in my Bee-line AND in my search. Obviously you‚Äôre not treated any better or with anymore priority if you‚Äôre a PAYING member. So poor customer service is going to be equally distributed between non-paying and paying members. Notifications come through sometimes, sometimes I just have to go into the app to see the message. Location feature isn‚Äôt accurate either, and conflicting at times. I can have someone ‚Äú4 miles away‚Äù in DFW, but they‚Äôre listed as also being at a Florida airport. That‚Äôs literally impossible. Bumble did a whole campaign against guns being displayed in pictures, but they could care less about bloodied hunted and fished animals in pictures. No blood=bad, Blood=good. Tell me how that makes sense. üòí"	negative
3774	930441707	lifestyle	1	"I spent some money to buy coins to super swipe for someone. After an update on the app I lost a few remaining coins that I still had from my purchase. I reached out to customer service and have heard nothing back from them over a weeks time. Not even to say they are looking into the event. I‚Äôll never spend money on this app again.

Update:

I wish I could post the screen shot response I got from customer service asking me to contact customer service via Twitter or Facebook. Uh, NO! First of all, did you even read my review that states I have reached out to customer service through the app and never received a response? So you want me to reach out to customer service again? No, it‚Äôs your job as customer service to get in touch with me, the consumer after I file a complaint. Secondly, you want me to reach out via social media? Absolutely NOT! Outlets like Facebook and Twitter go out to the world and in turn follows your activity for a better online and social media ‚Äúexperience.‚Äù So no, I will not be reaching out via social media. Thirdly, you‚Äôre a world wide app that uses social media for your customer resolutions? That‚Äôs a joke... with that being said, I‚Äôll continue to use your app to it‚Äôs free potential, but will never spend money and I don‚Äôt recommend anyone ever spends money on this app."	positive
3775	930441707	lifestyle	3	"I love that Bumble is supposed to be female driven and has the policies of no tolerance to inappropriate behavior. But in practice, I‚Äôve had far more luck making genuine connections on other apps. It seems like men swipe right on everyone but then decide if they‚Äôre actually going to respond if you reach out. The response rate even though we‚Äôve matched is really low and the conversations even when I‚Äôve tried to drive them are lackluster. I‚Äôm still seeing just as many profiles that indicate they want a hookup or nothing serious. Not something the app is responsible for, just an observation that the promise of putting women in control doesn‚Äôt seem to solve some of the problems of lazy men. 
The 24 hour time limit is also, while well-intentioned, frustrating without a hold button. I like to go backpacking, which is an activity that takes me off the grid. But if I match during that time I either have to pay for a redo or let a match go by. It doesn‚Äôt seem to value busy people. A feature that would let you put your profile into ‚Äúaway‚Äù mode seems like it could be really useful in helping to let busy, interesting people meet one another without looking disinterested."	positive
3776	930441707	lifestyle	1	"I‚Äôve subscribed to this app a few times in the past, and I keep seeing a pop-up that says subscribe to see people who already like you. In my opinion Bumble is better than the other useless dating apps, but there‚Äôs a huge flaw. I NEVER HAVE ANY MATCHES!!! 

I‚Äôve unsubscribed before in the past because the app said I had matches and when I clicked on them; nothing was there. Kept it for a few days after then unsubscribes. Downloaded again a few months later to see if it might actually work this time and show me people that‚Äôve actually swiped on me. Low and behold ‚ÄúYou have matches‚Äù popped up, I clicked on matches, and NO MATCHES again. At this point I‚Äôm just wasting my money subscribing, because without the subscription obviously you can‚Äôt see who liked you, or anything. Well you can‚Äôt see your matches when you subscribe either. What‚Äôs the point of having the thing if I‚Äôm just swiping with no results. Bumble Support before you reply back, yes I have the latest IPhone software and app update, deleted the app and downloaded again. If it‚Äôs a programming problem then it should be an easy fix; if not, then people are losing their money because y‚Äôall have everyone subscribed to see matches and everything else with a subscription just to turn around and get nothing in return."	positive
3777	930441707	lifestyle	5	To put it simply, I met the love of my life on this app. I had it on and off for about a year and met a lot of (mostly) great people and had many interesting conversations, but none of the relationships ever worked out. I decided to keep faith that maybe my person was on this app, and I met them! I am the happiest I‚Äôve ever been now. I like the way bumble is set up so you can filter exactly what you‚Äôre looking for, so you don‚Äôt waste your time on people who are looking for completely different things. I also like the 24 hour rule, because on tinder you can have 300+ matches and only talk to a few of them, but the 24 hour rule is nice because you create more meaningful connections. I never bought boost, as I felt the regular version of the app was enough for what I needed and I never had problems matching with cool people. If you‚Äôre new to online dating, definitely give bumble a try! You might have to go through a few bad dates before you meet the one, but I really think this app has the potential to create more long and meaningful relationships.	positive
3778	930441707	lifestyle	1	So I will start with this statement bumble is basically an app for  misandrists. I strongly believe it is a feminist based concept to empower women in the wrong way. It‚Äôs a cool concept at first but if you step back and look at is in reverse it would be hell to pay if women where not allowed to speak first. People are creepy not just men. I came across several women that where psychotic and severely delusional about reality of relationships. It‚Äôs not very diverse it‚Äôs for white men whom are 28-40 making 6 figures a year. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs seems to be the status quo ‚Äústatus‚Äù. If you do match with a female to beat the 24 hr timer they say ‚Äúhello‚Äù and nothing else. So then you stay in que indefinitely. You never here back from them. My account was moderated for no reason. I don‚Äôt use bad language I‚Äôm respectful. They could not tell me what I said to violate policy. It‚Äôs total garbage app I‚Äôve been on it a year now to give it a fair chance. Well chances are you won‚Äôt get far on Bumble unless you are a beta male. This is so sad society has come to this.  I‚Äôm going back to the old fashioned way of meeting. Bumble needs a lot of changes to make it male friendlier. Who wants to sit and wait for days till someone response to you. Then the women complain about being ghosted and being lied to. Well the women on the app do the same thing. ‚úåüèΩ	negative
3779	930441707	lifestyle	1	This service employs tactics used by other businesses to easily offer a free trial and will refuse any attempts to give a refund by any reasonable request. If you accidentally accept the trial and forget to cancel or literally don‚Äôt have time because you are working all day and forget to cancel or don‚Äôt know how-they are ruthless in acquiring your money. Legal contracts = it‚Äôs ok to take your money and will use the terms and services to your disadvantage. As far the actual value of the app and the premium service, little to zero value if you are not among the rich and beautiful. I‚Äôve emailed several times including the details about how I never wanted the free trial and definitely didn‚Äôt want the subscription all the while not even using the app during such period and they give an automated pretexted response because it is natural to gain revenue upon unfortunate people like myself. Use the app for free but do not accept any trial or subscription if you already have little success to begin with (just saying). I quite literally cancelled and emailed the very night it was deducted from my account and zero F were given. I‚Äôve never left a review on anything before until now. ‚ù§Ô∏è thanks for Absolutely nothing bumble! And for taking precious resources away from with zero shame. Way to go!	positive
3780	930441707	lifestyle	5	This past month I‚Äôve swiping left until I came across a really sweet caring genuine honest accepting guy named Levi. We‚Äôve messaged each other for a few hours until the next day we exchanged numbers. He gave me his and I took the risk of calling him and talking over the phone and we suggest to meeting and seeing each other. Couple days of seeing and knowing each other, I‚Äôve experience my first disagreement with a guy that I was falling for and may love in life because I did not like certain action traits he has given me. Then few hours after I calmed from my discussion with him about his action. I‚Äôve apologize and forgave him. I truly care for this guy that I am seeing but we decide to take some time to ourselves for a while, but still keep in touch with each other as friends. When in time he‚Äôs ready to have me back I will grab hold of his caring heart for an actual relationship with me. Moral point to my positive rant is for ladies separate your match options to the right guy just be yourself, honest and trustworthy to him.	positive
3781	930441707	lifestyle	4	I do have a few things to say about Bumble. First, I love that it‚Äôs so female driven. I‚Äôve done a lot of dating apps (and still do!), yet Bumble is by far my favorite. It helps me work up the courage to approach the guy for a change. More than half the time they don‚Äôt answer, but I can‚Äôt do anything about that. That being said, I‚Äôd like to comment on some new features I noticed and give some feedback. I love that you can add like quirks about yourself ie. perfect first date, two truths and a lie, etc. I also love that you can now see what people are looking for, religious preferences, if they want children and the like. What I think would be cool to see is if you could filter people based off these features. I‚Äôm currently looking for someone who wants a relationship, but has no interest in having kids in the future and I find that it‚Äôs a pain to have to sort through all the people who aren‚Äôt looking for the same. It makes the dating process even more of a pain. Just a thought. Everything else about the app is great and hopefully I‚Äôll eventually find someone on it!	positive
3782	930441707	lifestyle	2	"I took a break from Bumble earlier this year and last night I signed in and reactivated my profile. First, before expressing what REALLY bothered me about the new update, I want to say I was disappointed in the new layout as I think men prefer something less fussy and less complicated, so the theatrics of the new layout could be a turn off or have them engaging less.  Heck, even I think it‚Äôs overkill!  

But what REALLY disappointed me was that the developers took away two key features: shaking to undo a left swipe AND - MORE IMPORTANTLY - the ability to block any profile without reasons of abuse or harassment. If I see an ex-boyfriend, his brother/other relative, his best friend OR I see my neighbor, co-worker - really ANYONE that I just don‚Äôt want knowing my business or that I am trying to date...well, I should be able to block profiles for any reason.  While abuse/harassment is of paramount concern SO IS PRIVACY.  And I don‚Äôt want/need the guy I dated last Summer and it just didn‚Äôt work out, to know I‚Äôm back in the dating game.  It was a great feature (along with the ability to undo a left swipe) and it‚Äôs the change of these two features that made me immediately hide my profile and say, ‚ÄòNo thanks, Bumble‚Äô."	positive
3783	930441707	lifestyle	1	This has to be one of the worst dating apps on the market, you‚Äôre better to use hook up apps such as Tinder or Grinder. The dev try‚Äôs to curtail people‚Äôs experiences by politely blaming the user or stating that you were simply unmatched when a convo disappears. That there is no way that their ‚Äúflawless‚Äù programming could possibly cause a mistake such as accidentally deleting the conversation without prompts. But I have experienced this not once but twice. The phone vibrates as if I swiped a conversation left but no prompt so I try answered me their message but the app froze so now I assume I have an incoming message. I shutdown the app, no other notifications then I go back and what do you know, convo is gone with no way to recover. At least other apps you just simply block or unblock, Much more logical don‚Äôt you think?  So those reviews who have stated that there are issues, DO NOT disregard them by listening to the developer. The dev is in it to make money, so of course they‚Äôll lie just to ensure a profit.  Here‚Äôs an idea. Create a cache for the user that unmatches another so in the case that it was a mistake, it can happen since it‚Äôs only a 2 layer authentication for deleting a match. Please do not answer this with niceties or excuses, just fix and improve your issues.	positive
3784	930441707	lifestyle	1	Like other users, I have to say this is the worst dating app/site I have ever used.  Even though men are swiping right on you, if you message them almost none of them ever respond.  And if they do, it‚Äôs usually just one word answers and then they unmatch you.  I think this concept is flawed.  Men don‚Äôt seem to like having a woman message them first, even though that‚Äôs the concept of the site they signed up for.  And if you do, which you would think was flattering that someone wants to get to know them, they act like you‚Äôre some crazy person bothering them.  I think men see this as revenge for all the other sites where they get ignored by women, because I‚Äôve seen several profiles that say, ‚ÄúCome up with something better than ‚ÄòHi‚Äô or ‚ÄòHow are you?‚Äô‚Äù or ‚ÄúMust be over a 7‚Äù or ‚Äú$100 to any woman who can write a profile without saying ‚Äòtravel‚Äô, ‚Äòwanderlust‚Äô or ‚Äòno hookups‚Äô‚Äù.  I have been using it for months and have not come across any men who actually want to meet someone, I think they just use it as a swiping game to see how many matches they can get, but if you actually try to contact them, they ignore you.  I think the only way to make this app come even close to the already low success rate of other apps/sites is to just let men contact women.	negative
3785	930441707	lifestyle	3	"TLDR: burying profiles of those who like you so you spend money on their ‚Äúsee who liked you‚Äù service 

So I‚Äôve been a long time user and recently noticed something that didn‚Äôt sit too well. Bumble usually does a pretty good job of letting you know when you‚Äôre liked, but recently I noticed they have been giving accounts that ‚Äúlike you‚Äù but no matter how much you swipe.. you‚Äôll never see them. At first I was confused after hitting the ‚Äúno more people around you‚Äù message and bumble was still saying someone liked you. Then I realized almost every third card or swipe I got was an ad promoting their premium service and the ability to ‚Äúsee who likes you‚Äù. That‚Äôs when I realized they‚Äôre just putting either a fake picture in the ‚Äúpeople who like you‚Äù box, or their burying an actual person who does like you in order for your curiosity or frustration to push you into buying their premium. I get it bumble, a premium service is a good idea for some. But this somehow feels underhanded or sneaky to me and I‚Äôm not a fan. Definitely still going to use the app lol but not as enthusiastically as before"	positive
3786	930441707	lifestyle	2	"I‚Äôve been on this app on and off for a short while. I consider myself a decent looking guy, at least a 7 on a rating scale looks wise, I work hard to develop good qualities that I would like to see in myself that would make a woman happy and investing there time in me worth while. But I‚Äôve found that I very rarely get any matches on this app,
and when I do it‚Äôs almost always after I‚Äôve uncaringly swiped right for 5-10 minutes consecutively, just to see if this app really does work lol, and then I end up matching with women I don‚Äôt really like... 

I am 5‚Äô5‚Äù, so I don‚Äôt know if that has a huge part in my lack of success, but I can‚Äôt help but feel that dating apps these days are favoring those who invest in the upgraded version of the app. Which makes sense on a business stand point, but makes me feel that these apps are just a wast of time... and I just don‚Äôt feel like throwing $15 away to ‚Äúpotentially‚Äù find a decent woman based off some algorithmic process that is out of my control. Perhaps the old fashion way of just approaching women at group activities, through friend hangouts, and random encounters is the better way to go?"	positive
3787	930441707	lifestyle	4	I‚Äôve had this app for a few days now and so far I love it! I‚Äôm finding that the general population of men on this app are actually a lot more frequently guys that I would actually go out with than men on tinder! I also really love that matches disappear after 24 hours if a conversation isn‚Äôt started. It actually makes you engage with other users and helps keep my match feed clean and updated! My biggest request though is that I think it would be really useful to have the option to opt out of the ‚Äúwomen have to send the first message‚Äù thing. I get it, it‚Äôs a great idea, but sometimes I get so busy or I just can‚Äôt think of anything interesting enough to say (I don‚Äôt want to use a generic ‚Äúhey‚Äù) and my match disappears! I end up feeling like I potentially missed out on a really great guy or wondering if they had anything interesting they would have said to me first. Just a suggestion, but I think the ability to opt out would be a great feature! Otherwise I totally love this app! MUCH more worth your time than Tinder.	positive
3788	930441707	lifestyle	1	"I‚Äôve been on this site for awhile and I‚Äôve got to say a couple things.  1) it‚Äôs premium packages are too expensive and people who pay for it must be desperate because I paid and it did nothing to boost more likes.  2) the settings must be bugged because I have it set for a 10 mile radius and it‚Äôs showing me people 30 miles away.  I live 20-25 miles away from the airport so some of the profiles I see are from people changing flights that live in Chicago or other parts of the world.  3) I‚Äôve had the app for way over a year now and I‚Äôve got the same two likes I‚Äôve had since a little after I started using this app.  4) there‚Äôs not really an algorithm to the site it‚Äôs just a knock off of tinder but the women chat first.

It‚Äôs like my profile doesn‚Äôt get shown or those two likes are from when I traveled last year.  If you like swiping right endlessly to increase the likeness that you‚Äôll match with someone or paying the premium to ‚Äúboost‚Äù your profile to the front to increase the chance for likes then this is the app for you.  The only app where no matter what you do premium or not it‚Äôs all the same.  You get what you pay for or don‚Äôt pay for.  ‚ÄúIf you get on now you have a 3.5x chance of matching üí•‚Äù. Bogus"	positive
3789	930441707	lifestyle	1	"I‚Äôve used Bumble for about a year ago and then restarted a new account a few months ago. Recently my account was deleted after I went back on app, and I was very surprised knowing that I did not do anything wrong (or perhaps someone might have had reported me? - still surprised me to ask myself ‚Äúwhat just happened?‚Äù). I was agonized about the situation because I had great matches and connections. So later, I made a new account, which had a verified profile, verified phone number and email, with a paid subscription to add further, that it seems Bumble took down my latest account without acknowledgment or reason, again. I reached out to the support team (by several emails sent weekly) and no response. I had to contact Apple to get back all the subscribed refunds since my accounts were blocked or removed from the app. Till this day, I am unsure why Bumble would do such a thing.
Personally, Bumble is careless about loyal customers and brand loyalty. It‚Äôs not fair, especially for me and anyone who deal with this matter, because we want to find connections and dates. I was to believe Bumble would be a great fit for those type of reason to use for dating app, but I was proven wrong.

My name Gretalia."	positive
3790	930441707	lifestyle	1	They recently changed how people appear in your Beeline. It‚Äôs now based on an algorithm of who they think is your best match. Those ‚Äúbest‚Äù matches will appear at the top of your beeline. The old beeline showed the most recent people that swiped right on you, in that order, which would also be in your vicinity. Lucky for me, I visited Vegas, along with thousands of other people from all over the country, in June. It‚Äôs now October and the Beeline shows that I‚Äôm most compatible with everyone that lives outside of my state. Several people from Nevada, Florida, etc... I‚Äôm in Washington. Now, if I wanted a long distance relationship, that‚Äôd be great, but I don‚Äôt, and Seattle is one of the toughest places to date. I also don‚Äôt have time to endlessly check where people in the Beeline are from and then swipe accordingly. (And I spent a long time trying to clear that out only for it to be an endless endeavor.) Bumble - you have to revert back to the old beeline where you see the recent, local, right-swipes first. Or, give people the option to sort how they want. I can only imagine that this is horrible for people that travel a lot as they‚Äôll never see local, hometown matches at the top.	positive
3791	930441707	lifestyle	5	This app changed my life! Dating is hard as it is and at this time and age who really has the time to go out at meet somebody? At least I didn‚Äôt have the time, so online dating was the best option for me. I tried many websites and  the one thing that always bothered me was the creepy guys that won‚Äôt stop talking to you after you told them you are not interested. Bumble was different! I am a feminist and I liked knowing that the majority of the people that were here will be comfortable with a girl that wants to say the first ‚Äúhello‚Äù, it eliminated the macho men that I didn‚Äôt wanted to date. It also gave me more control in the process because I was able to decide who I want to talk to. Also, don‚Äôt disregard the ‚Äútwo day option‚Äù, my fianc√© used it to show me that he really wanted me to talk to him again and he made sure to remind me before the 24 hours expired. Ever since then my life has changed for the better.  Thank you Bubmle for helping us meet! ‚ù§Ô∏è	positive
3792	930441707	lifestyle	1	Bumble will ban users for no reason and no explanation at all. The ban is permanent. Women can also do no wrong on this app. The obvious prostitutes and women with engagement rings on their fingers don‚Äôt get banned, but a picture of The Beatles at Tittenhurst Park will get you banned for life, which is the case of me. I had other pictures of course. Even when I was on the app I couldn‚Äôt stand it. I did not have an issue as far as matching with people. When you first download this app you be matched pretty quickly with about 10 people to start assuming you‚Äôre a normal person. I truly believe these are test accounts just to get your confidence up. After that, matches are hard to come by. And they‚Äôre hard to come by because any woman who is REMOTELY ATTRACTIVE will be matched with 100+ guys in less than 20 seconds. This is absolutely true. Pretty soon it‚Äôs in the thousands and these women will not scroll through the waiting list to find you. Don‚Äôt blame them. Women have 24 hours to respond to a march. I‚Äôve matched with a decent amount of people. I‚Äôve never had someone actually send a message. Women rarely approach guys in person or initiate a conversation to strangers in person. What makes Bumble think they‚Äôll do it on an app?	positive
3793	930441707	lifestyle	1	I‚Äôve been on other dating apps before in the past. I really liked bumble at first because I liked the concept of not getting bombarded by hundreds of messages by creepy men.. I ended up matching with someone and we talked for about a week on the app before we exchanged numbers. Long story short I found out he was a catfish even though he had a blue check mark next to his name meaning he is verified. I thought it was cool that you can verify yourself on this app to try and prevent being catfished but it really didn‚Äôt make a difference. The main thing I also don‚Äôt like is how my location is public. I understand they need my location in order to find local people for me to match with but why does it have to show on my profile for everyone to see? Prior to me finding out that the guy I was taking to was a catfish I noticed one day that he was about 10 miles away from my location even though he lived 60 miles away from me. I don‚Äôt know if this was a coincidence but it was concerning to me. I ended up blocking and reporting him after he finally admitted that he was a catfish and I‚Äôm not sure if bumble did anything or not. As with any other dating app there will be catfish and creeps but just be careful.	positive
3794	930441707	lifestyle	4	I find it kind of weird that Bumble stresses ‚Äòfeminism‚Äô SO MUCH but I don‚Äôt really understand what‚Äôs feminist about it? Women are the ones in charge of starting conversations, which more often than not feels like a burden rather than a right. It‚Äôs 2019‚Äìactual feminists recognize that men do not need to be doing all of the initiating! Most women are not scared to start a conversation, especially if they‚Äôve matched with someone on their dating app; we don‚Äôt need to be thrust into conversation-starting like that, it feels paternalistic, tbh. And the conversation prompts are stupid, like the ‚ÄúI feel most empowered when...‚Äù ?? It‚Äôs weird to see female empowerment commodified in this way. It cheapens it. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt all bumbles fault: they were trying to solve an epidemic of harassment through dating apps, but the root of the problem is societal gender differences, not the functions of the app itself. Other than that, Bumble is a good app. Gets the job done. I would love if we could delete conversation prompts from our bio if we don‚Äôt want them anymore!!!!	negative
3795	930441707	lifestyle	4	Bumble does what it can to bring quality to dating via online. I think some improvements could be made with the 24 hour response rule. This just is simply too short of a window. Bumble promotes the app as a woman empowered app where we should go out in the world and be the baddest Bees we can be! Yet, we‚Äôre supposed to be tied to our phone waiting for that match to come in and then message within 24 hours. I feel this goes against what Bumble preaches. Sometimes I‚Äôm a busy bee taking on the world at work and don‚Äôt have time to message someone within 24hours and the same for the bumble guys. I think not sitting on a match forever is right on but I suggest a ‚Äú3-day rule‚Äù for initial responses. Give people time to have balance with dating and other life responsibilities. The app says if a match expires you can have a chance to match again but why would I swipe again on a person that either ignored me or ran out of time the first time? That basically makes women continue to throw themselves at men... just saying.	positive
3796	930441707	lifestyle	1	"This app seems was designed to swindle lonely people. When I had the free version it showed blurry bubbles and a message stating 9 people liked my profile, and I had to get the paid app to find out who. I enrolled for a month which was $22. Then I checked who liked me, there were only 3 people instead of 9, and they were from far away. So I adjusted my distance parameters to 50 miles. This adjustment ended up my options. Since then I‚Äôm getting literally zero, one or luckily two profiles to view per day, and a screen advising me to check later for more. I can‚Äôt even see the people I liked. 
I wrote Bumble various emails to request them to provide me with the service, or to disconnect my account and reimburse the remaining days (which was more than 3 weeks), or to downgrade my service for the weekly rate. 
They apologized they couldn‚Äôt do anything. On top of that, despite I live in a very well populated city, with more than a million inhabitants, they suggested me to extend my searching parameters, and asked me to recommend them to my friends so I could have a ‚Äúbuzzing experience‚Äù.  
This looks like joke, but it isn‚Äôt. Learn from my experience and don‚Äôt waste your money."	positive
3797	930441707	lifestyle	1	Good thing I only paid for one week. Read some of the reviews. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been using this app for a couple years and I love the way it puts the women in control making the first move‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt read any thing about meeting actually someone and forming a relationship. Most of the people on here I would have to say are real. But as far as anybody getting any notifications that would ruin the developers game. Cause if they actually notified all the beautiful women every time somebody swiped to right meaning yes eventually and sooner than later she would be gone. You don‚Äôt hear anybody talking about how they met the love of their life on here. Or even anything being mentioned how anybody has met people that they are now great friends. I would get notifications saying someone is interested in you. Hurry up and start searching your next swipe could be a match. Common.... really. Then if that‚Äôs not bad enough I extended the distance to the max which is 100 miles and I ran out of searches. I have no idea how they have a 4.1 out 5 rating. And 24 hours is not long enough for a person to respond. These days people are very busy. And do not take the time to open this app every single day.	positive

I also love the fact that I have to be the one to initiate the conversation. No more being bombarded with unwanted or creepy messages üòÇ. I didn‚Äôt like this feature at first, but now I‚Äôve come to appreciate it.

One of the major downfalls is even though I said yes to getting notified of new messages, I only get notified about 70% of the time. And other people I‚Äôve talked to have had the same issue. On top of that, there‚Äôs not time stamp on the messages, so you have no idea how long a message has been sitting in your inbox if/when you don‚Äôt get notified and run across it.
And then one improvement to the profile that I‚Äôd love to see, is an area to put what you‚Äôre really there for. A relationship? Hookup? Friends? A serious relationship? Dating? It helps weed out what you don‚Äôt want faster."	positive
3799	930441707	lifestyle	5	I‚Äôve been on a lot of dating apps. This is by far probably the best app. The fact that the women has to message you first means that she‚Äôs already interested in you. It‚Äôs a great boost of confidence to know someone is attracted to you. Anyway I deleted this app a couple months ago because I finally met my dream girl. I‚Äôm writing this review in the off chance it helps someone. I was on this app for probably about 3 years. I‚Äôm not going to say it‚Äôs an easy process. For me there were long periods of time in between when I would actually match with someone and even longer for when the match would send me a message. Anyway don‚Äôt give up hope, keep swiping. Remember that your match might not even be on the app yet and that it‚Äôs a lesson in patience to find her. Be yourself, be honest in your profile, and treat the women on here with respect. You will find someone, there is someone out there for everyone. Just keep searching. And keep your chin up!	positive
3800	930441707	lifestyle	1	Many use online dating as a way to hookup, and then there are those of us who have demanding jobs and can‚Äôt go out all the time in the hope of meeting someone. I initially tried bumble because I had hoped there‚Äôd be fewer creepy guys here given that it‚Äôs all about woman messaging first, etc. Well, maybe a few years ago that was the case. Nowadays it seems like everyone wants an open relationship/hookup, or you‚Äôre matched with guys way outside your preferences. Even if you make a connection (and are clear you‚Äôre looking for long-term), most of the men will be looking for hookups. Many times messaging will fall flat, or you‚Äôll connect and they‚Äôll never respond to your first message and it will expire. On the brief chance that you do actually go out - 9 times out of 10 they‚Äôll never contact you again despite trying to set up a second date. Dating prior to using apps would always lead to second and third dates, so I learned the hard way that it‚Äôs not me - it‚Äôs the kind of men who use these apps. Be warned. If you‚Äôre looking for a hookup this will work out for you, if not, save yourself trouble and heartache and try meeting someone in person instead.	positive
3801	429047995	lifestyle	5	Everytime this app updates it becomes worse and worse, like I genuinely love Pinterest but I cant stand the updates it has, most of the time they are so annoying, other times it's okay but that was only when you had the selection option and you can arrange things but now you have gotten rid of it and now I can't even stand it anymore, I'm tired of seeing ads like every other pin than the ones I actually want to see, like I understand that it's a free app and all but why every other pin be an ad??? It wasn't like that before?? I see them so much that I just have to hide them and why is the hide option right next to the pin option too? That literally made things so confusing for the people who used it long time and would accidently hide a pin (personal experience) and sometimes there isn't an option to unhide either so your stuck with that pin gone forever. I will still use the app it's just much more unnecessary things here and there than what the consumer wants, or what I want. I still think it's a great app I just don't think these updates actually help Pinterest in anyway just making it worse than it actually is, Please start taking more consideration to the people who use Pinterest and figure out what is actually needed and what actually needs to be fixed before destroying the app. Thank you for reading	negative
3802	429047995	lifestyle	4	I love Pinterest but if you‚Äôre going to update the app and give me options of things to do, don‚Äôt take it away! I used to be able to like pins if I didn‚Äôt have a board to put it in. I can ‚Äúreact‚Äù to certain pictures but I can only use one reactions option and it‚Äôs not for all pins. So now I have a bunch of pointless boards so I can still see things that I like. I loved having the option of sections in boards because if I have a ‚Äúhouse work‚Äù board I can do a section with the bathroom, the bedroom, the living room, etc. It was a while since I updated and when I finally did, I wish I hadn't. I went to create sections for my travel board based on places to make it easier to plan my own trips and I can‚Äôt! I‚Äôm actually mad about this. And something that isn‚Äôt really a major issue but kinda disappointing is that when I come across a pin that I like and want to see more of, I tap on it. But sometimes it‚Äôs just an add and it takes me to a website. Which I guess I can see more by going through the website but I can usually access the website if I voluntarily tap on the picture after getting a preview. This is also the only app that closes out on me. I know it‚Äôs a free app and it takes a while to give the app its full potential but this isn‚Äôt really a new app anymore. Keep updates!!! When you bring in a new feature, don‚Äôt take it away from us! Some of us are (more like were) using those	positive
3803	429047995	lifestyle	5	I‚Äôve had Pinterest for maybe about four days now and I love it. It‚Äôs a great app for ideas for a dream room, or a birthday party. On the other hand though, there is some issues. I don‚Äôt know weather or not to call these adds or adds that are pins, but some are inappropriate. Nothing real bad, but a lot of them show boobs! A child under 13 should probably not have this app. Another slight problem is that some pins take me to websites. Ok most people don‚Äôt have a problem with this, but I do I find it quite annoying. I don‚Äôt want to go to a whole other website, or download an app to learn how to loose weight, or do a diy. And if it isn‚Äôt going to take me to a website then it doesn‚Äôt tell me at all. If I click on a pin that says it will teach me how to whiten my teeth, and doesn‚Äôt show me how then how am I supposed to do it. Not all pins do either of these things of coarse. Pinterest is still a great app just some things need to be fixed. I have been addicted to this app despite my problems, so everything is still workable. I‚Äôm about to move, so this is app is really helpful currently. If the developers could just fix these slight bugs, I believe this would be a great and helpful app to all ages. Thanks for taking time to read my review if you did, and I hope it was helpful to those about to download the app.	positive
3804	429047995	lifestyle	5	"I really love this app but i do want to know how you make story pins, their very creative and I think that it was a very cool idea. Sombody said you have to have a certain amount of followers but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fare since is harder to get followers on Pinterest than on tik tok or Instagram, I don‚Äôt know though maybe I just have to turn it on in settings. I have 437 followers (which I think is a decent amount) but I can‚Äôt do the story pins so I‚Äôm really confused. I looked through the Pinterest app in the App Store and it said nothing about story pins......üòï

Edit: so I figured out it‚Äôs called carousel pin and that you can make collages BUT you have to do it from your computer and I think that‚Äôs crazy. Just for a pin you have to go onto your computer instead just by your phone,again this is a very cool app and I love the idea of carousel pins but that‚Äôs just extra steps for no reason. For your next update can you maybe included letting us create these from our phone..... I don‚Äôt know maybe it‚Äôs just me. Another thing is that I seen a comment that is asking how to make a video pin and then there‚Äôs me asking how to make a carousel pin, if you could just include how to make these things in your description or put how to do it in settings that would be niceüòä but Pinterest is a very fun and cool appüôÇüôÇ!!!!!!"	positive

But I recently got the iPhone 10 max and now it just constantly freezes up when I‚Äôm on Pinterest for a while and my phone doesn‚Äôt do this on ANY other app or any other time. So I have no idea why it keeps doing this... but it is pretty aggravating. 

Other than that though this app is the GREATEST!! I come here for- it used to be just for like crafts and food, but now I have come to use it for makeup ideas, for like if I have a khaki jacket and I want to see what other looks and styles and colors may go with it (that matches what I may have in my closet) I go on here for an idea of what the possibilities are to wear with it. I recently used it to find out what kinds of dresses and outfits to wear to a Christmas party.. so you can get ideas and picture yourself in the clothes, you can have a idea of what you‚Äôre looking for locally. And of course this is where I go for beautiful quotes to add on Instagram. Or funny memes even to describe super specific situations üòÇ you can use Pinterest to find basically anything! Gift ideas, crafts, DIY, recipes, home decor ideas, outfit ideas, makeup tutorials, if you want a hair cut and you are looking for different styles... like you name it and they have it! Oh yea and Starbucks drinks to try!! That‚Äôs my favorite!"	positive
3806	429047995	lifestyle	3	"I think I've reached the end of Pinterest! I keep seeing the same content over and over again. I only follow around 3000 people's Ms follow more every week. I have 9000 followers--which my number of followers slowed down significantly when they changed the feeds and algorithms. I can no longer see the people who follow me--even though my number of followers go up, it's no longer adding profiles to the followers section. I am so sick of seeing advertisements and sponsored content that have NOTHING to do with anything that I would ever want to see from Home Depot (I think we all kinda know about Home Depot at this point) to Pantene hair commercials. The settings for automatic video play do not work. And dare I use the ""show me more like this button""; CLEARLY Pinterest's taste level has a bug since it usually looks NOTHING like what I've just pinned. I preferred the only method of see who else has pinned this pinned so that you could start following others with your same taste level and subject matter. Pinterest has become almost as bad as Houzz for the masses and has become very hard to curate sophisticated collections of idea boards. I use Pinterest to work with my clients and promote my business. There are very few settings that you can change and I am so tired of seeing the same content over and over again! Oh wait, I already said that--well now you know how it feels!"	negative
3807	429047995	lifestyle	2	I mostly love Pinterest and the app, but there is definite room for improvement. Severely dislike the new way to search! Please go back to the way it was before this last update. Also, the constant refreshing means that as soon as I focus on a pin I might want to click on it‚Äôs gone. Please allow us Pinners to manually refresh our feed! Probably my biggest complaint is the lack of ability to edit the title or description of the pins we pin via the app. It was there and now exists only on the full site. Now I‚Äôm having to go back through EACH pin I‚Äôve saved in the last few weeks and edit EVERY ONE on my computer. PLEASE fix this! The comments are where we, as Pinners, get to add our own thoughts to the ideas we are pinning and it‚Äôs the way we can search our own pins to find the ones we‚Äôve saved. It is an essential function of the pinning process! That is the point right? To actually use the pins we save? Looking forward to having this bug squashed soon! Lastly, if I could have Pinterest the way I really liked it best I would return the like button and remove the tried button. I don‚Äôt really care who has tried a pin that I save. If I needed to gather several ideas quickly I would go through and like several pertinent pins so they were saved and go back to pin them later when I had time to add my own descriptions. Feeling nostalgic just now! Please bring back the likes! Thanks!	positive
3808	429047995	lifestyle	5	Thanks to Pinterest I can express myself throughout creativity and just art boards and just all these boards that I can make and I can express myself through them I think my favorite two boards is probably my Jesus Christ one and my photography because those are two really important things in my life and this is a really great app for all ages and I do recommend it to anyone who is eligible to have it. And I first got it when I was about 11 and I just got an iPod not a phone but my parents wouldn‚Äôt let me have any kind of social media so this was kind of like a social media for me and I very much enjoyed it you can fine inappropriate things on there if you search them up I have never search them up but if you click on the wrong link or something it could lead to something so just be mindful when you have your kids on there it will ask you of like things that you‚Äôre interested in just make sure that you are looking over that because there are things on there that maybe you should look over with them other than that it‚Äôs an excellent app and in less you‚Äôre truly searching for something or you just click the wrong link you won‚Äôt find anything bad and I truly absolutely for the very last time do you recommend it to all thanks!	positive
3809	429047995	lifestyle	3	"The Sponsored Pins are out of control. I see sponsored content more than I see my own friend‚Äôs post (and I mean face-to-face friends). On multiple occasions the sponsored posts have opened without any intentional interaction on my part; just from my scrolling through the app or when searching for something. But I have to put an effort just to see what an individual friend‚Äôs personal activity/recent pins. I feel like a creep. And now I‚Äôm getting told ‚ÄúHire an interior designer from [sponsor],‚Äù when I‚Äôm just tryna look at a bookcase! That‚Äôs too far. 
I‚Äôve been on Pinterest since it‚Äôs was invite only and now it‚Äôs overcrowded with multi-level marketing schemes and aggressive sponsored ads posing as real pins. I miss seeing my REAL life friend‚Äôs posts, not just what some AI algorithm thinks I want. And what‚Äôs up with the pop-up asking ‚Äúdid you find what you were looking for?‚Äù, why do you need an answer when I don‚Äôt even know what I was looking for? It‚Äôs just as uncomfortable as having a sales associate invading your personal space and following you around the store tryna make a sale sell when you‚Äôre just trying look around. That behavior is what keeps people from making a purchase or coming back again. 

Now I‚Äôm concerned with how my data is being used. Don‚Äôt pull a Facebook Pinterest, I‚Äôd hate to see you go down like them and lose the trust of your users."	negative
3810	429047995	lifestyle	5	I can‚Äôt imagine not having Pinterest. I could be without all other websites and social media, but the creative side of me needs my Pinterest fix. I‚Äôm able to organize all of my ideas which is great for me because my mind runs 90mph with these ideas every day either way. I love my secret boards. I love trying new things. This year I have a new raised garden bed and redoing my front yard. One of my favorite things about it is that I can make Pinterest my MAIN Wishlist/Registry I don‚Äôt have to make a bunch of different registries for events... I can add people to a board and pin things from ANY website. So I don‚Äôt have to remember all those passwords for those individual sites. (Example: You‚Äôre having a baby and want to have a Target Registry, Babies R Us Registry, Buy Buy Baby Registry, etc etc...) Instead of doing them all separately you can just pin all the products you want from those websites directly to ONE BOARD on Pinterest. You can add your friends and family to the board or you can just send them your board link. They can follow the link and look at everything you‚Äôve pinned in one place and make a purchase. You don‚Äôt need to create registries anymore. Everything I need is available on Pinterest. Thanks y‚Äôall!	positive

3812	429047995	lifestyle	3	"This used to be one of my favorite apps. I got my husband hooked on it as well. But now it seems that ads are taking over. Too many buyable pins that have nothing to do with anything I‚Äôve ever looked at or saved. And way too much pornography for a site that claims they don‚Äôt allow it. I highly doubt that a picture of a naked woman with her legs spread and that links to a xxx site is considered ‚Äúart‚Äù.  I agree that in artistic instances nudity would be acceptable, but on a site that I am supposed to be able to hand my phone over to my child to play on, these things shouldn‚Äôt be on there. I get that it‚Äôs the same risk you run with using the net, but these things show up in home feeds when you‚Äôve never looked at anything remotely close to it. My husband showed me a funny gun meme and as her scrolled through the ‚Äúmore like this‚Äù several naked women came up. If the pinning rules aren‚Äôt going to be enforced, there should be some sort of family filter you can click on. I‚Äôve also noticed over the past couple days, my husband has a recents tab in his boards page that I don‚Äôt have. This is actually pretty handy if I‚Äôve looked at something but didn‚Äôt pin. Seems like if I try to go back and find something I‚Äôve seen earlier in the day, it‚Äôs impossible to find again. 
With a few improvements and enforcements it could be better."	positive
3813	429047995	lifestyle	4	I love this app for finding and organizing all sorts of crafts, recipes, home tips, etc. but it is really irritating to continuously have a bar popping up at the top of each webpage asking if I have found what I want. Most of the time I am pulling these sites from my own saved pins so yes, I have found what I wanted because that‚Äôs why I use your app, to find what I have saved here. That, and when I am choosing a pin from a search I notice that this question bar loads before the page even loads and takes up part of the page. At that point it‚Äôs just annoying to be asked if I found what I wanted because I can‚Äôt see the webpage yet and certainly don‚Äôt know what is within the page yet to know if I did indeed find what I wanted. Please consider altering how and when you ask your users if they found what they wanted. Maybe the pop-up could be altered to only pop up when a search from the home page is done. Also, maybe change it to pop up 30 seconds after the user clicks a link so they have a chance to see what is on the page before being asked for feedback. Overall, I still love your app and use it all the time. I just want to stop seeing this pop-up every time I open a link I‚Äôve had saved for years. Thank you.	positive
3814	429047995	lifestyle	1	I use to love Pinterest. It was my favorite. I chose what I wanted to look at. Then they started changing things and changing things more and more. Made us have to look at their stupid ads and suggested posts. Now it has gotten to the point to where 90 percent of everything is ads and suggested posts-guess what I don‚Äôt want to see what you have suggested. I want to see what I want to see-what I chose to follow. There is no way to remove the crap and even if you report and remove the incessant ones, they just add that many more. Here‚Äôs a little tip-I do not want to see and have no interest in pins that are in a foreign language and I have to look at them constantly. So I‚Äôm really getting over Pinterest. Add in the fact that I can‚Äôt see who pins what anymore-I like seeing when the people I follow that I like have pinned something but now I can‚Äôt tell because it‚Äôs blank where a user use to be listed. Every update it gets worse and I find myself getting on Pinterest less and less. I am quickly losing my interest in Pinterest. They need to go back to letting people control what they look at. I could understand having some ads but the amount of content on my board that I didn‚Äôt follow has gotten way out of control. If it doesn‚Äôt get any better and I keep getting pins in foreign languages then I will just quit using it. I hope it improves soon. If not then I will stop using it.	positive
3815	429047995	lifestyle	1	My favorite part of this app was the fact that I could go to explore and find new ideas, hence why I always have so many boards. New ideas would pop up in the explore and i would love it and go crazy looking for new ideas from pinterest by looking through the explore every chance I got but you guys got rid of the explore. Now when i click one pin even by accident i get 50 more pins for the exact same pin. Sometimes It would be one simple recipe of pie and now i have 30 of them everyday. So then you guys created an option where I can not get specific suggestions from what I clicked but even when I unfollow what I clicked it doesnt matter because my feed is literally still exact suggestions from my boards I created. So i feel like i dont get anywhere with this app. I am literally on instagram all the time because I can see different new things not different versions of the same thing especially ones I pinned already. Its fine when im searching for something but after a while I get the point and I get off the app. I wont even bring up the ads. Sorry but Im done with this app. I sure i wont be the last. Your new users dont know what their missing but seeing the same sweater everyday will get boring for them too eventually. Bring back explore so we can see new ideas, stop thinking i want to see 80 different versions of a pink Christmas tree.	positive
3816	429047995	lifestyle	4	I‚Äôm all about Pinterest. I love the recipe and meal ideas, the seasonal outfit ideas, the cookie & cake decorating ideas and the ability to find awesome ideas for parties I‚Äôm planning. When I first started using Pinterest, years ago, not only could you save a pin, you could click on a little heart and like it. Where did that go? Now, on another person‚Äôs board, I saw a little lightbulb in the bottom left of the pin that said to tap and hold for reactions. This is great but when I went into my board to check out my pins it didn‚Äôt have that feature. I‚Äôd kind of like the option to like a pin again, especially pins personal pins, not just re-pinned things. Will everyone eventually get these reaction buttons? I really hope so. I guess what I‚Äôm saying is it would be great if someone saw a pin that was of, say, my own personal content, they would both have the option to ‚ÄúLike‚Äù it and to re-pin it. It be nice for the person who‚Äôs putting their own content on Pinterest to know if their followers like what they‚Äôre pinning. Other than that I think maybe you could slow down on the ads a little. I know Pinterest is free, which is fabulous, but ads popping up more than once or twice during a video is really annoying.	positive
3817	429047995	lifestyle	5	"As a retired educator of 44 years I have felt bad about students not learning the ‚Äúbasics‚Äù.   I am a firm believer in lifetime learning however and have found the internet, especially Pinterest and u tube to be an amazing resource.  My hobbies include woodworking, welding, customizing autos, boats, motorcycles, oil painting, silversmithing, etc.  no day passes that I do not find something valuable.  After camping and hunting for a lifetime I am shocked about how many tips I find to make these hobbies more comfortable or economical.  Think about being turned around in the woods or a city.  Ask seri and you can get out the most isolated spot.  Drive along and see a sign in Spanish or some other language and you can get a translation,  The benefits are endless and Pinterest is a wonderful tool. 
The biggest problem I had with public school students was the question ‚Äúwhere are we going to use this?‚Äù  If you are in an unsatisfactory, dead end job then education is the rescue.  Education does not have to be classical academic.  It can be welding, home building, concrete work, electrical, auto repair, beauty school, or what ever you are interested in.  Pinterest can answer a lot of questions about whether to proceed into a field. Keep an open mind!"	positive
3818	429047995	lifestyle	4	I note the feed for ‚Äòhome‚Äô is thankfully the same as before, with multiple pix across the page, but the feed for ‚Äòfollowing‚Äô is single, large format pix., making it difficult to consume many photos for time spent. Please, please change this back! That said, I have been a long-time Pinterest user and have seen it go through a lot of changes. I have to say they have been pretty responsive to requests, overall. You can now opt between suggested pin feed, or feed from people you follow. You can once more arrange boards to suit. You can also choose how you want to view boards, 3 across, 4 across, or a page of small thumbnails. Also, as many Secret boards as you like. Something for everyone. It used to be far more social, as far as associating people with their pins, even when they were re-pinned...although problems sprang up with people being very protective about the artistry of their boards and discouraging people from pinning more than a few pins a day, and so things changed. I agree with many that the promoted pins can be a bit much, and I would prefer not being automatically taken to a site. Still, it is a great app and still allows for lots of creativity and enjoyment.	positive
3819	429047995	lifestyle	5	Hi! Before I go into my suggestions I would just like to say I don't leave ratings a whole lot so I don't know if there is a proper way to set up my comment LOL. Anyway I think this app is AWESOME. It runs really well and the quality is just amazing. There is one improvement I have. There are A LOT of pins that have some serious vulgar language. Now I understand you can't really tell people to stop swearing but maybe there is a way to block these pins? Of course I know you can block pinners but maybe instead there is a way to block the pins that have vulgar language instead of blocking the pinner. So you are just blocking one of their pins and not all of there boards. Maybe like a child-friendly mode? It is just really annoying when you are just scrolling through your home feed and boom there is this pin that swears like crazy. I have already turned off recommend pins and unfollowed people that pin pins that have vulgar language but I still run in to this problem. I just don't want to see that stuff. Anyway I don't know if this is possible but if it is I think it would be an awesome improvement. Again this is a great app and I totally suggest downloading it.	positive
3820	429047995	lifestyle	4	"I love Pinterest and the app has made it so convenient for me to be able to save the things I like onto boards. Not only that but I can always find creative inspiration for my next art project or meal! It‚Äôs like having an online memory box where I can look back years and see how my tastes have changed and evolved. Plus I‚Äôll stumble onto an old project, recipe, or general pin that I like and be able to use it again!
The only thing that I would change about the app is a feature that has pulled up in the newest updates. For example, when I search ‚Äúbrunch ideas‚Äù there is a button on the lower center portion of the screen that says ‚ÄúRefine‚Äù. While I can appreciate the concept for it, it‚Äôs more of an annoyance to have it on top of where I‚Äôm scrolling to look at pins. I think it would be a better fit at the top of the screen in the same section as the search bar so that it eliminates the issue of a button covering part of my pins. It‚Äôs a small issue, however it can become quite cumbersome when I don‚Äôt want to refine anything. Even if there was a way to turn it off/close it when I don‚Äôt want it, that would be great! So far I haven‚Äôt been able to find out how to do that.
Even with this, I still love the app!"	positive
3821	429047995	lifestyle	2	I have used Pinterest for over ten years. I have loved this app/website. There is nothing else like it. Over the last couple of years, though, my feed quality has really suffered. I used to see new pins based on every one of my interests, which I had carefully cultivated. I could go months without seeing the same pin twice, and my feed was full of variety and color. Now, my feed seems to be based only on recent activity, so if I only pin to three boards over a few days or a week, I will only see content related to those three boards with maybe 1/20 being outside of those topics. If I only pin from my home feed, that means that I‚Äôm reinforcing this funnel until my home feed looks the same every single day. If I pass over a pin without saving it, it can show up in my feed again and again, making things feel stale. I‚Äôll also see pins related to topics I don‚Äôt like, but even though I hide it, that topic will show up in my feed again and again as if I had never touched it. Also, when I do a search I‚Äôll only get a few pages‚Äô worth of related pins before it starts looking like my home feed, with results that have nothing to do with what I‚Äôm searching for. I still use the app because there‚Äôs no other available resource like it, but it‚Äôs no longer my favorite place for inspiration.	positive
3822	429047995	lifestyle	1	"I have used Pinterest for over 10 years and just deleted it permanently. Literally every 3rd ‚Äúpin‚Äù (or picture) is an advertisement for some company or brand that has nothing to do with what I‚Äôve pinned or with my interests. There is no way to turn ads off or to see less ads. You‚Äôre way better off just going to Google to get ideas.
They used to have a ‚Äòcategories‚Äô option where you could choose Art, Beauty, Crafts, Recipes, etc. but they removed it completely. This makes no sense and makes it very difficult to navigate the app. Removing this feature also makes it nearly impossible to find new content ~ isn‚Äôt that why Pinterest was created in the first place? For new ideas and inspiration?
I used Pinterest for art inspiration but this became increasingly difficult to obtain to the point where I couldn‚Äôt find anything new or interesting. 
But there were always tons of new, irrelevant ads and videos from companies! I also NEVER see what people I follow pin anymore ~ it‚Äôs ALL ‚Äúsuggested‚Äù pins from Pinterest which are based off of a single picture I pinned. So if you pin a picture of, say, a cute plant holder, the next time you log onto Pinterest your entire feed is pictures of plants and ads for teeth whitening kits (?!).
I‚Äôm sad that a great idea for a creative app has been ruined but it has. Save yourself a headache and go to Google images."	positive
3823	429047995	lifestyle	4	I love this app, and have been using it for awhile. But this new update layout is very ugly, it would be great it you guys made it back to its other layout, this new layout feels pointless, and makes it harder to navigate.                                                                            Edit: Now on top of the bad layout that still has not been reverted, you have gotten rid of the feature to see what boards pins are saved too, which is an awful, awful decision, as now I can‚Äôt find boards I like that help me expand my related boards. So now I just have to find profiles and hope they have stuff I like, which should NOT be how I find boards I like. These updates are ruining the app more and more and it‚Äôs making me enjoy it less and less. I could get use to the new layout, but taking away the feature to see boards that pins were saved on is crossing the line, you are making this app a hassle to navigate and you won‚Äôt even listen to anyone‚Äôs feedback no matter how many reviews and emails you get. I‚Äôm almost done with this app, I‚Äôve given it much more time to fix than it deserves at this point and you people don‚Äôt seem to care to fix it‚Äôs horrible problems that YOU cause.	positive
3824	429047995	lifestyle	5	"the statement below was my previous rating, till I realized that Pinterest created an old-school space under the ""following"" tag where I only see images from people I'm following... exactly why people fell in love with Pinterest to begin with. thank you so much for going back to the basics, and even though you still have these whack ads, they're on the ""home"" section, not the ""following"" one, so yay!!! please don't muck it up with ads on the ""following"" section. what you did is genius, and now everyone should be happy.

old review: why, Pinterest? why? I don't understand why you continue to push pins from people I don't follow. I don't follow them for a reason. don't you understand that pinterest is visual therapy for many, that is, they log in and get much relief from seeing all the ideas they've pinned as well as pins from people or boards they follow. but then we see ugly images that are supposedly taken from our own interests, and they muck up the whole flow of image therapy. then I have to click ""hide"" one image after the other after the other until I get so sick and tired of seeing the same ugly pics and just close the app. you guys are whack."	negative
3825	429047995	lifestyle	4	"I used to use Pinterest more than any other social media but since these latest updates I‚Äôve been using it less and less. Every time I pin something, 75% of the following pins are the same subject or even the same pin repeated. I like how the app is recognizing my interests but I can‚Äôt keep my followers over the same chicken recipe.
I also miss the circles in the bottom corner since it was able to easily see some related pins without getting lost in the ‚Äúmore like this‚Äù pages. It was also nice to see who pinned what on the homepage so I can continue to follow people who use the app and unfollow people who no longer do without having to go onto every pinner‚Äôs page.
Something that Pinterest doesn‚Äôt have that I have been craving sense the beginning: SUB-BOARDS!!!! I hate going onto someone‚Äôs page and they have over 100 boards and at least 10 are the same subject. With sub-boards pinners could follow and create one board and use smaller boards within the maim board for sub-categories. Say drinks for example and the sub-boards would be alcoholic beverages, smoothies, infusions, etc. Our pages would be so organized and things would be even easier to find with such large boards."	positive
3826	429047995	lifestyle	2	"I love pinterest and I think the new layout is quite interesting... However, there are many essential qualities of this app that I‚Äôve carried issues with for a long time now. The inconsistency of their effectiveness, for one, is major.  Sometimes I‚Äôll get a notification on my phone saying someone has commented or saved one of my pins... But after opening the app and checking the notifications tab I‚Äôll find nothing at all. This doesn‚Äôt always happen but usually it does and I find it super annoying.

Another example of this issue with inconsistencies‚Äî or perhaps simply an issue in general‚Äîis when I DO manage to receive a notification from someone liking or responding to my comments on pins. Upon clicking on this notification I am not directed to the actual pin itself‚Äî but merely a non-interactive image of the pin with the comment section below it. Once again, it doesn‚Äôt always happen but is especially frustrating when I want to save this pin to another board or perhaps haven‚Äôt saved it at all and wish to do so... Yet I am unable to and my only resort is to take a screenshot and search it up on my own terms. (Even then it‚Äôs almost always unsuccessful.)

Like I said, Pinterest is a great app with good means‚Äî but it is small annoyances like the ones aforementioned that keep me from calling it perfect."	positive
3827	429047995	lifestyle	5	I‚Äôve been asking for sub-boards for years and Pinterest finally delivered! Although you previously had keyword terms show up in boards, you couldn‚Äôt create your own, so it wasn‚Äôt as great. But now you can! The only bad thing though is I‚Äôm seeing a few glitches on mine. Since we can create our own sections within boards, I tried to combine a couple of my original boards into sections on just 1 board. I noticed that every time you edited the location of a group of pins from one board to another, you had to close back out of the app afterwords because the other board wouldn‚Äôt appear in the new destination list when you tried to switch some more over again. Then, since I thought all of the pins from one board had successfully been moved to the other board, I deleted the original, only to find out for some reason that they hadn‚Äôt actually been moved to the other one. I lost an entire board todayüò¢ please fix! Also maybe have suggestions as to which pins belong in which sections? Other than that though, the new feature is great.	positive
3828	429047995	lifestyle	2	"This is more about Pinterest itself than the app. Every fourth or so pin in my feed is an ad now, so the platform is pretty much useless to me because all I can think about as I‚Äôm scrolling is if I‚Äôm looking at another ad or not because I kept accidentally clicking them, which then takes me to the ad provider‚Äôs website page and away from my Pinterest feed. This to me almost feels like a strategy Pinterest is using: more ads = more people clicking the ads = more revenue. While I understand the mindset behind ad revenue and don‚Äôt disagree with it, Pinterest incorporates way too many ads to the point that it‚Äôs excessive and not as fun of a platform as it used to be. I can barely look at the pins by users I wanted to actually follow without seeing the same ads over and over again. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs as many ads on the computer or not, but I definitely won‚Äôt be using this app again anytime soon. 

I‚Äôm disappointed in what Pinterest has become, and a happy medium needs to be found for how many ads are in user feeds. I‚Äôll be using Instagram as my source of learning about new products and experiences from now on, benefits I used to get from using Pinterest. While Instagram has ads, they aren‚Äôt nearly as frequent and irritating as those on Pinterest."	negative
3829	429047995	lifestyle	3	I‚Äôve been using Pinterest since the beginning, when it was invite-only. I planned my wedding with Pinterest, I stumbled onto so many cool ideas and life hacks and interesting people... Pinterest legit made my life *better.* Now I hardly use the app at all. It‚Äôs almost all ads, and I hardy ever see content from the people I follow. Even worse is the search function, which is... pathetic, to say the least. Pinterest used to be fantastic for helping me find inspiring images and links for just about *anything* I was looking for; now searches only yield a handful of results, all of which are ads, *none* of which are actually relevant to my search. I‚Äôve been using Google image search a lot more now. Pinterest has become essentially useless to me. I‚Äôm not seeing content I like, I‚Äôm not able to search for content I like, and with so many ads, the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù aspect of this so-called ‚Äúsocial media platform‚Äù is nonexistent. Seriously, what‚Äôs the point? I‚Äôm holding out hope that developers will take critiques like this seriously and restore some of the functions that made Pinterest such a great app, but... I‚Äôm losing patience. If things don‚Äôt get better I‚Äôll probably just delete the app and save space on my phone... why keep a useless app around?	positive
3830	429047995	lifestyle	3	It might be that I am just getting used to these type of social media formats, but I was hoping to find more art nudes, interesting photography/photographers, experimental works, and perhaps links to auctions, galleries, etc... I joined having searched for an artist whose only bio was linked to Pinterest. This phobia of nudity or nude photography being considered pornography almost has the opposite intent:  de legitimizes formats with the best ‚Äúintentions‚Äù for random queries with no sense of values, aesthetics, social, or otherwise. Access to art is more important ultimately I am learning in this strange social experiment of internet media shuffle fraught with so much garbage. What we permit in terms of violence in both media and society, in pornographic policy making should be of greater concern than exposure to the many forms the human body presents as a muse and as artistic expression itself. As was always the case, Art follows nature. And if not, it is our nature. So silly and tiring does this game then become. I can‚Äôt participate in something so full of itself that pretends to be on a higher ground only to literally cover its buttocks ( breast‚Äôs, vagina, etc...). Maybe there was something I missed, but it seemed like a very deliberate decision and as a store of images, art, commerce, I can‚Äôt in good conscience support it.	positive
3831	429047995	lifestyle	5	"I love Pinterest. I‚Äôve been using it almost every day for over 7 years. Love the App! It‚Äôs only gotten. Better  Love the content and the concepts! I love the algorithm, always shows me perfectly related searches and ideas for crafts for look books! I‚Äôm able to collaborate with people and create coordinated projects. I use it for vision boarding my goals, picking an outfit in the morning,  and putting together my dreams! It‚Äôs very easy to use! Very forgiving of any mistakes I make with my fat fingers. 

One bug. In version 7.41.2 the app keeps freezing on me. I‚Äôll be scrolling and my screen will freeze and the app will, after a couple minutes of fighting, shut down. Or I‚Äôll be in a post and it‚Äôs just unresponsive. When this happens I usually close it, open another app and it‚Äôs working fine, my phone isn‚Äôt frozen so I  give Pinterest a moment and it works again but it‚Äôs been happening almost every time I open the app!

3832	429047995	lifestyle	2	So Pinterest is an amazing app and I love it but some things on here really need to be worked on. I use this app every day to get inspiration for all sorts of things and while I‚Äôm looking through pins and I find one I like I‚Äôll click on it to look at it in more detail and the entire app will freeze. So then I have to restart the app and even then it‚Äôs stupid because the pin I liked and was looking at is no longer there anymore. Next, when I go to post in a community I‚Äôll click on the ‚Äústart a discussion..‚Äù text bar and the the app will crash and take me back to my home screen. I‚Äôve done everything I could to see if maybe it was just my phone, but no, it‚Äôs the app. It crashes when I go to post in communities, every time.üôÉ lastly, I‚Äôll be on my feed or whatever tab and then suddenly the screen turns completely white and all the pins and everything off my feed disappears. Normally I can fix this by going to another tab and then going back to the tab that was blank and then it‚Äôll work fine, but it‚Äôll automatically reload the page and the pins I was looking at before the screen turned blank aren‚Äôt there anymore. like I said. I love this app, but this is getting real annoying, real quick. Kinda makes me wanna delete it sometimes.	positive
3833	429047995	lifestyle	3	I used to LOVE Pinterest‚Äôs Health section because I used to rely on it heavily for my fitness information. Now, over the past few months to a year I‚Äôve noticed it slowly start to change. The number of ads increased the line my feed every other post, there are more fake posts that when you click on them take you to a website that has nothing to do with what was on the feed (when you submit them for a report and you wait and wait and wait then you go on there and they‚Äôre still there), and there‚Äôs always the same posts about the same things and a mass majority of them are the posts that you submitted a report for and would no longer like to see. I love every other section of Pinterest with the exception of Pinterest‚Äôs beauty section with there being ads for ‚ÄúItWorks‚Äù (we all know it doesn‚Äôt actually work), or for ‚ÄúLipSense‚Äù (If I wanted to wear it when I first saw the ad I would‚Äôve gone on their website and ordered it but it‚Äôs cheap quality and I hate it). Please improve the ad quality or completely ditch it because I know people who are just as sick of it as I am and in the long run these ads are going to be the downfall of Pinterest and why no one goes on there anymore, just like Facebook.	positive

3835	429047995	lifestyle	3	I love Pinterest and I use it almost every day‚Äîwhich is the only reason I‚Äôm taking the time to write this review. Seems like (pretty major) changes to the UI/UX have been constant recently. It‚Äôs frustrating to have to figure out the differences so frequently. Beyond that, they‚Äôre just strange. It continues to get more difficult/complicated to add a new pin at all (even more so from a web link)‚Äîwhy would you redesign something that makes features of your app more frustrating to use? Especially when you push the browser button so heavily for use on desktops... why make the closest equivalent on the mobile app so hidden and take so many extra ‚Äútaps‚Äù? Visually, the design of the individual pin view is just so odd and nonsensical to me. Why does each section need to be so entirely separate? Why waste so much space with these huge rounded corners? It makes it a visually cluttered experience. Also, sometimes I want to pin a particular image to multiple boards because it fits in multiple places for me. Recent updates have made doing so more difficult and frustrating. I guess maybe I‚Äôm in a minority for that one, but generally taking a scolding/patronizing tone with your users seems like a poor choice.	negative
3836	429047995	lifestyle	5	I love Pinterest. I love the craftiness, the free patterns, recipes, and DIY stuff! Truly, Pinterest has given me weeks‚Äô worth of sewing patterns for doll clothes, helped me kill ants and fruit flies, and FINALLY get a smeary film of a huge mirror. I just have one request. We used to be able to report broken links. That has disappeared, with at least the last few updates. Now we can report pins, for all manner of politically correct reasons (bullying, harassment, etc.), yet can‚Äôt just tell you when it doesn‚Äôt work. In my years using Pinterest, I have only ever had three types of reports to make: when a link is broken; when it sends you to a page that does not contain what you asctally clicked on; or my biggest beef‚Äî when the pin promises free pattern or instructions, and you click on it and wade through a dozen ads, only to reach the comment at the bottom, ‚ÄúSorry, tha pattern is no longer available for free!‚Äù Those pins should be reported and their content pulled. I don‚Äôt appreciate false advertising. And Pinterest does not even let users report those things. Thanks for listening.	positive
3837	429047995	lifestyle	4	I love Pinterest, but it‚Äôs getting ridiculous. Me and my friend spend all day messaging pins back in forth, but since the new spam rules have been set, I can only send 2 things to her before I get blocked. Here‚Äôs how it works, if they get annoyed with me, have an option where they can block me, DONT JUST DO IT FOR THEM! And what is with the ads and pins that I‚Äôm not even into? Are you even trying anymore Pinterest? Just cause I‚Äôm fat doesn‚Äôt mean every other ad should support plus sized women‚Äôs clothing(which I‚Äôve never looked up on Pinterest so how they even figured out I‚Äôm plus sized is a mystery to me) and just because I like a certain topic doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want to see pins from other boards that don‚Äôt always see eye to eye with me. That‚Äôs why I used to love Pinterest so much, because I could follow boards by other users with similar tastes, and if I wanted to explore into other people‚Äôs boards, I‚Äôd type something into search like ‚Äúhorses‚Äù and look at the pins, found user I liked and followed their boards so their stuff would pop up more in my feed. Please get back on you A game Pinterest! I‚Äôll take this post down when you fix the spam thing!	positive
3838	429047995	lifestyle	5	"As a visual person, Pinterest is a remarkable resource for seeking out really anything my heart desires.  I used to ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù things when I had a question, but as far as quick answers are concerned, Pinterest is definitely my go to. 
From recipes, crafts, building ideas and pure scrolling entertainment, it is a fantastic venue to save and catalog your ideas. I love how blogs and businesses can share their best practices and products directly to their actively looking audience. 
As you can tell by the magnitude of my pins, I have found more than I was looking for!  I love Pinterest and think they carved a perfect niche for themselves out of the bustling infrastructure of the web and I am glad they did. 
If I could change anything, I would get rid of the new system of uninvited ads bombarding the search content, especially the oversized video plugs. They litter the searches and belittle  the organic marketing that has been fostered here.
I still enjoy the purpose and function of the platform and appreciate the ease at which I am able to find what I need... now back to figuring out what to do with  cantaloupe seeds."	positive
3839	429047995	lifestyle	5	"After pinterest updated on the 28th I‚Äôve been having an irrevocably troublesome time quickly pinning things to my own boards. The feature that‚Äôs activated through pressing and holding a pin pulls up several smaller icons that allow for different functionality. I‚Äôve become accustomed to pressing and holding to immediately put something onto a board because everything used to be familiar. Now after the update, the main feed has several new icons that appear alongside the previous ones when pressing and holding, and because of this, I have permanently hidden pins that I would‚Äôve originally added to my boards because apparently, SOMEBODY thought it was a good idea to put the ‚ÄúHIDE PIN‚Äù icon in the exact same location as the previous ‚ÄúSAVE PIN‚Äùicon.

Further more, there appears to be no clear and straightforward way to undo any of the hidden pins which is frustrating for me, someone who has gotten used to pinterest‚Äôs old way of doing things! Lol

Pinterest is a fine app for inspiration but the interface definitely needs to be rethought again."	positive
3840	429047995	lifestyle	1	"Update 2/7/20: now, I can‚Äôt even use the app to PIN things, the entire purpose of the app, because the share button is not working, and whatever idiot is in charge of updates also removed the add from website option directly on the app. If I knew of something else like this app, I would use it instead. PINTEREST, you need to look back at how your app was about 2 years ago, and reformat it that way. It was better. People miss it. Every update for the past year has been a change for the worse. 

Ever since the last 2 or 3 iPhone updates, this app crashes every time I go to one of my own boards. If I actually open a pin in my feed, when I go back it refreshes and I lose whatever I wanted to look at next. I‚Äôm often hesitant to actually pin things because my feed will show me anything and everything the algorithm thinks relates to it whether I want it or not. They have rendered following boards you like nearly useless, as the following feed is just one big picture after another rather than like a pin board so you can‚Äôt really see what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôd rather see it in the same format as my regular feed as their pins are what I actually want to see. And FFS can it stop showing me the same crap over and over again after I‚Äôve already said it wasn‚Äôt relevant to me?"	negative
3841	429047995	lifestyle	4	Pinterest is a great place to look at images and find new ideas. However with every update you never know what is going to change for the better or worse. The last couple have been for the better, but before that it seemed like many of the updates took away something I enjoyed about the app unexpectedly. I like the change back to showing who saved each pin on my main dash. I also appreciate the new board sections. I do not mind the picked for me pins to some extent, but I prefer the pins from the boards I have followed. I didn't like it when they changed the way a pin would show how many times someone save a pin from a specific board to all the boards that it has ever been saved to, but I got used to it and it turned out to be better. However taking that away helps no one. I do not care how many times a pin has been saved if I can't see what boards it has been saved to. I would appreciate it if the updates told me what was changing. I don‚Äôt like being scared to update because I have no idea when there is going to be another change that will go against my enjoyment of the app.	positive
3842	429047995	lifestyle	4	I like Pinterest for the most part, but when I am scrolling through and swiping the screen to do so, if my finger touches an add, it opens up instead of continuing to just scroll along. Very annoying! The adds are mixed in with all of the other pins, but they are clearly designed to open much more easily than the regular pins. Regular pins don‚Äôt open up accidentally just from scrolling along. This bothers me because of how everything we do on our devices is tracked and recorded so these companies can try to build a history of our interests to try to target us with adds. So When I am unintentionally opening adds that I don‚Äôt care about, I am being targeted with adds that don‚Äôt pertain to me. In other words, the digital history of what I click on is distorted, and therefore, whoever is collecting this data is not getting an accurate depiction of me. It‚Äôs a glitch in the matrix. They are taking the greedy approach and forcing adds onto us that we don‚Äôt want, and over time it will mess up their targeting system. This is probably why as a 35 year old male, I get adds trying to sell me products for menopause.	negative
3843	429047995	lifestyle	4	I love Pinterest, but I‚Äôve noticed lately that whenever I try to save a pin, it doesn‚Äôt always recommend the right boards. Like what I mean is I will scroll down my home feed and save like 5+ pins to my Tom Holland board (lol) but then if I save like one Steven Universe pin I have to scroll all the way down to that board because other random boards are recommended for me and save it there. And then if I try to save another Tom Holland pin, it STILL won‚Äôt recognize that I‚Äôm saving a pin of him and I have to scroooooll all the way down again. I know I probably sound very high maintenance saying this, but around two months ago, I never had this problem. It just appeared recently. It‚Äôs still one of my favorite apps, but this has made it sort of annoying. I used to be able to save anything from Lapel Pins, to Steven Universe, to Drawings, to Funny, and they would be the top suggested boards. It‚Äôs not like most of my boards are new, which I was thinking may mess up whatever algorithm they‚Äôre using because the app needs to get adjusted to that new board. I just don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs not like he problem prevents me from using the app, so I‚Äôm good.	positive

but as soon as i switched back to my personal account, the algorithm just GAVE UP on me. it was only makeup, nothing that was from any of my followers, i couldn‚Äôt understand what was happening.
i went to my settings and removed ‚Äúmakeup‚Äù from my interests (apparently that was the only one i had), thinking my feed would go back to normal and suggest things i liked that were similar to the previous things i saved.
nope.
my feed is now blank. if i want to find content similar to my boards, i‚Äôd have to search for similar pins to something i already have. it‚Äôs less convenient and i don‚Äôt want to reselect the things i‚Äôm into. my school account has no problem with this! therefore, i know it‚Äôs a bug. please fix it."	positive
3845	429047995	lifestyle	5	"Another major update and more changes that make zero sense.  Why is that camera on the search bar?!?  So frustrating to hit it every time I tap in that space to edit my search.  But my major frustration is WHY DID YOU MAKE IT SO CUMBERSOME TO SEE COMMENTS AND PHOTOS?!?  If i pick comments I don't want to see comments and then have to select again to see more comments. I don‚Äôt know who is making these decisions but I have a hard time believing they ever actually us this app. 

Original review: I was happy to see other complaining about some of the changes to Pinterest over time that have become sooo frustrating, but the one thing that really drives me nuts is the search function. I search for something rather specific ""vintage shampoo bottles"" and all I get in return are clothing pins and home design pins.  Nothing at all related to my search? What the hell happened?  It used to be fun to search on Pinterest but I guess I'll have to go back to google image searches to avoid all of your sponsored crap.   If you need money just ask us to pay to remove ads for Pete's sake."	negative
3846	429047995	lifestyle	3	I have been enjoying this app a lot, and currently have 8000 pins in 63 different boards/sections. I have been exposed to all kinds of new craft techniques and aesthetic inspirations. Despite the antisocial nature of the app that other reviewers mention, I have found the algorithms to be very useful so long as a suitably descriptive query is used as a starting point. My only complaint is that your tagging functions are absurdly primitive. Because I cannot search for tags by board or section, I do not bother with them. This dampens the ability of my pinboard to be a tailored, searchable image database. But it also limits Pinterests‚Äô overall web traffic, because fewer people bother to add descriptive words to their pins. Why bother? They can‚Äôt be queried in any meaningful way. Also, an entirely separate field in the description, solely for tags, would make things even better. Paired with a batch selection tool so I could add tags to multiple photos simultaneously, this would be an ideal tagging system. Seriously, how can you folks neglect something so vital? I hope to hear from someone, I am extending the benefit of the doubt that there is a human on the Pinterest team who reads these reviews regularly.	positive
3847	429047995	lifestyle	1	"Pinterest used to be amazing 1. Ability to like posts, gone why?
2. Privacy settings are a complete lie!  Suggested for  you is on off mode yea right , go back later after doing some pinning or searches and Bam there they go suggesting the things you recently looked at! 
3. Major GRUNT! Why the heck can't they have things in their exclusive category ie: search any ethic group for the sole purpose of interest in said groups items, life styles & things etc and BAM THERES BECKY 
::: hands up emoji::: why? , you can simply put copy cat Becky with her wanna be braids in her own category , hello she's not African anything so why is she there?

3848	429047995	lifestyle	5	I love the Pinterest website. I love to cook, and I love fashion. I think it's great to not have to have to thumb through lots of books for great ideas. There's even videos showing how things work. The fashion in men's clothing is great! So much is affordable too! I'm always ready to review products. If there's one thing I really had to do to get things right was the sizing. I so much wanted my shirt I wanted, but it was a bit small, for example. I guess some of the clothes you have to figure the size for yourself. Clothes it seems are a different size if their made in Korea vs made in America. Some things I've seen I don't even have a clue what the numbers indicate, but I have seen both. It may have been my fault not finding another size chart. I learned to be really careful when I order. I do appreciate their making it simple to return items. Anyway, I'm getting better ordering online. Some things do seem to take a while, and if you get the wrong size, we'll ya just ain't happy. Of course no problem with food. Groceries right around the corner. I hope this was helpful. Peace!	positive

If you happen to have another Pinterest account and you log out of one and look at the other one, you will find a bunch of ads inserted  on your boards which you never chose. This means that everyone who sees your boards will also see those ads which is why I have written the following review:  (Pinterest, once a delight, now is all crap and used for advertising only.  If you don‚Äôt believe me, look at your account as others see it and you will see what I mean but you have to log out of it and access at it from another account.)

Ads have been incorporated on my boards that I didn‚Äôt place there, totaling negating the Pinterest effect.  My personal friends and those I‚Äôve made on Pinterest have complained about this as well and how they were not asked or consulted before Pinterest itself decided to insert ugly these ads  onto their boards (we ARE after all called ‚Äúboard owner‚Äù)  without consultation.  Pinterest has decided to become a total dictator by taking out the format and design of subscribers‚Äô, thus  taking all pleasure from their usage.  

Yes, indeed, Tumblr is the way to go, at least as it is now."	positive
3850	429047995	lifestyle	1	So I used to love Pinterest but I‚Äôm so frustrated right now.  I‚Äôve been emailing their support thingy for multiple days now and the lady is trying to help but she‚Äôs either not understanding what I‚Äôm saying or can‚Äôt help me (bless her heart, she‚Äôs trying).  I put my notes from school on Pinterest and one of them got over 600 saves.  I hadn‚Äôt updated my app in a while so to check all I had to do was scroll to the bottom of the pin and it said ‚Äú600.‚Äù  But then I made the mistake of updating the app and now I have absolutely no way to view my number of saves.  The support lady told me to make it a business account, which I did, and now I can only see the number of saves within a 90d/30d/7d/24hr time frame.  But no matter what I do, it says 0 saves.  I had 600 saves and now I have 0?! What the heck?  I‚Äôve been asking her multiple times where I can check to see the true number of saves but she keeps avoiding the one question I need answered. I do not believe it‚Äôs her fault, I believe the app developers made a bad decision and she has no control over it... so please please please please put the total number of saves back at the bottom of the pin near the comments for personal accounts because I hate having a ‚Äúbusiness account‚Äù and still not being able to see my number of saves.  Okay, that‚Äôs all, thanks...	positive
3851	463630399	lifestyle	5	....I LOVE VS/PINK clothing etc BUT sometimes trying to check out is soo frustrating!! That was the case for me Wednesday eve. Since I‚Äôm a forever angel, I  got to shop Black Friday early. I was in the middle of checking out and for some reason, the ‚Äúfree pink tote with $75 purchase‚Äù kept coming out of my cart. As I was fighting with putting it back in, the pink/mauve teddy half-zip pullover was removed from my cart. Getting that color pullover was the main reason I started shopping! Needless to say, I was beyond frustrated/angry and thought of cancelling my whole order. I begrudgingly picked another color and whatever ‚Äúglitch‚Äù that prevented me from getting the free tote cleared and I was able to finish my order, get the tote but I lost out on what I was truly seeking to buy that evening. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right that items can be taken out of your cart while you‚Äôre actively checking out. There should be some sort of grace period of 15 minutes for you to check out and have your items preserved without fear that someone is going to come along and steal them from you. This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened to me and IFI continue to shop with VS, I‚Äôm guessing it won‚Äôt be the last.	positive
3852	463630399	lifestyle	2	I LOOOOVE VS and PINK but their apps are ridiculously SLOW!! It becomes very frustrating to use the app, trying to scroll and the screen doesn‚Äôt move, takes so long to load when u click on something to view, AND a lot of times when I do click on something to view and then click the back button to what should be the point where I left off of to view the item but instead takes me back to the top. Then I have to scroll back to where I was. It makes me not want to view an item n see what other color choices there are bc of it. These thing don‚Äôt happen all the time but they do happen more than the times they don‚Äôt happen!! There are times where I just want to see what‚Äôs new or just scroll through but I end up just closing out of the app bc of how long it takes and the other issues.  PLEASE make your app for convenient. For the amount of money we are all willing to pay for clothes that aren‚Äôt always the best of quality but yet we still love them and pay the high prices,  then some of that money should serve to make an app that is way better than it is. Using this app is what u would expect using some 5 & 10 store app.	positive
3853	463630399	lifestyle	1	The app is very slow, I would probably buy everything on a web browser if buying online. I only downloaded the app because of their ‚Äúsnowed in‚Äù promotion, where they are giving away free gift cards. For the promotion you blow on the screen to see if you‚Äôve won, but it hasn‚Äôt actually worked. I see on the App Store this feature has only been on the app for 5 days, so there is probably a glitch or something that needs to be worked out. Either way, for the promotion to work your microphone needs to be turned on for the app. I went into settings, did some research via Apple, and the only way to turn on the microphone is if the app requests to use the microphone. The problem is that there was no option ever offered to use the microphone, no way to request to use the microphone, and no way to manually turn on the microphone for the app. The app just says ‚Äúenable your mic to play,‚Äù despite the obvious problem that they didn‚Äôt force the app to ask permission to use the mic when adding the feature to the app. TLDR: promotion doesn‚Äôt work, app is slow as heck, don‚Äôt waste your phone storage on this app.	negative
3854	463630399	lifestyle	3	The app can be EXTREMELY slow and I hate how every time you click on today's offers, you need to sign in again. And most of the time, when you DO type your email and password in and click on the ‚Äúsign in‚Äù button, it loads for a little bit and then goes back to the page to have you sign in again. And it can keep doing it over and over again until the point where I just want to delete the app. If someone would be able to fix this, that would be great. I also wish that this app would add the feature where you could type in the location of your store and set it as your store because it really would be convenient if you could click on an item on the app and see if your local PINK store/ Victoria‚Äôs Secret has it in stock. It would just make it easier so that way you know if you should drive down to the mall or just order it online. I would really like this feature because other apps such as the Hollister app has it.	positive
3855	463630399	lifestyle	2	I love PINK, but this app is just not worth it. For starters, it‚Äôs very slow. I wasn‚Äôt going to complain about this because I was blaming my WiFi at first, but now that I see other people complaining I know it‚Äôs not just me. Second of all, there is an unacceptable amount of glitches that make this app very inconvenient. Items often get stuck in your cart and you can‚Äôt remove them. You pretty much have to start all over or wait for the app to function properly. Now, this last thing might just be me, but it‚Äôs the most annoying of all. I cant checkout! First you click the checkout button, then do the secure sign in and put in your shipping info. Then you click the button that brings you to delivery. Every time I do this I get sent back to my cart. I‚Äôve tried multiple times and can‚Äôt check out. This app is just not worth it. I went through all the trouble of finally getting the right things in my cart but can‚Äôt even buy anything. I don‚Äôt recommend this at all. Shop online or in stores.	negative
3856	463630399	lifestyle	2	My fav store is VS/Pink! Love this place! But they def need to upgrade their app AND website! Making payments on my credit card is hard. My last payment I had to call in to customer service. It‚Äôs to the point where I just wanna pay off my balance & not use it due to difficulty making payments. There just aren‚Äôt many options are far as the check out process & payments. There are many glitches within the app. It‚Äôs very very slow! It will constantly reroute to log in page, etc. There are so many issues within the app that I can‚Äôt list them all. Plz plz update this app & also work on your website! Shopping should be easier & more fun. Black Friday was a total nightmare! I almost had a melt down trying to order items. The app just couldn‚Äôt keep up. Freezes a lot too.. Shopping, the check out process & making payments takes hours of my much needed time. I feel like this company makes enough money to upgrade their technology services for their customers.	positive
3857	463630399	lifestyle	5	So far I've been loving the Pink Nation app! It's makes shopping to one of my favorite stores so easy and care free. Sometimes shopping online can be very stressful, but this app everything but that! I love the scratch-off offers it allows members to use when shopping, and the games you can play to try to win store credit. I also love how they offer cute wallpapers and stickers! (You can win more by earning badges in the app! I actually have my wallpaper set to one right now) The only request I have is that you keep your online items in stock!! I could not stress enough that when going for my size, the color or style I really love, isn't in stock. I request that maybe you try to offer more color in more sizes. But other than that, this is a amazing app and I 10/10 recommend!!!	positive
3858	463630399	lifestyle	1	"I used to open this app multiple times a day to play the game, get some cute wallpapers, and buy some lotions and clothes when they had a sale. But now that the game (that I was completely obsessed with) is gone, I‚Äôm pretty much done shopping at VS. Like everything is really expensive anyway, why not give customers a chance to have fun and win a lil something if you‚Äôre expecting them to buy $60 sweatpants? Ridiculous. 

Also, the ‚Äúchill‚Äù tab is literally just frustrating, glitchy videos and cliche quotes. I‚Äôm all about self care and confidence building but honestly, telling me to ‚Äúbe myself‚Äù through really basic statements that you can read on crappy dollar store greeting cards isn‚Äôt really my idea of ‚Äúchilling‚Äù.

Also, I‚Äôm not sure why all of the college hype is necessary. I‚Äôm a college student and even I think it‚Äôs way too much. Like apparently all VS shoppers live in sororities? Fact: that is not true at all. Some women who are older than college age probably feel pretty uncomfortable right now and honestly, I don‚Äôt blame them."	positive
3859	463630399	lifestyle	1	"I would receive emails about promotions that you would have. I would go to your site and spend my time trying to get the deals and while checking out, it would then state that the merchandise is no longer available. It did this about 3 times, I got so frustrated I decided not to order anything. 
There were other promotions that the same thing happened where the merchandise was not available. If you going to have these deals please make sure that you have enough merchandise for at least more than a few hours. 
My daughter really loves your clothing and I really wanted to get her some of these deals for Christmas, but I am disabled and can not go to your store on Black Friday and take the chance of being pushed as my other daughter (who lives in PA) was when she went to your store. 
We pay a lot of money for your clothing and I think the one time of the year when you have these wonderful promotions we should be able to GET them. 
Thank you, Lori Eberhart"	positive
3860	463630399	lifestyle	1	Not very satisfied with any of my visits recently. Everything takes forever to load. It constantly logs me out even if I haven‚Äôt left the app, I have to re-enter the coupon deals multiple times because they say they are invalid and they won‚Äôt take them, but eventually they do sometimes, but other times they won‚Äôt mind and you have I have to re-enter the coupon deals multiple times because they say they are invalid and they won‚Äôt take them, but eventually they do sometimes, but already after you‚Äôve entered them so many times you don‚Äôt even want to buy the products anymore. And the pages load so slow most of the time so the majority of the time that you are on the app you will just be waiting for the pages to load him staring at a loading sign. The only plus side about the app is there a let you know when deals are going on, but it‚Äôs not like they make shopping easy for you.	positive
3861	463630399	lifestyle	1	It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that Victoria Secret being as large as it is doesn‚Äôt have a better developed app. It‚Äôs absurdly slow, crashes randomly, items get stuck in your cart and you either have to start all over (if you‚Äôre even patient enough) or place the order and hope it doesn‚Äôt process within the one minute it takes to contact the live chat person to remove the item manually. And if it does happen to process, then pure stuck with having to return the item.... which all could have been avoided if the app simply worked properly. When you look at an item and hit return you start back to the beginning and given the app is SOOOO slow, you have to be patient and wait to scroll back down to where you were before. I‚Äôve written several times before and never hear back which tells me VS doesn‚Äôt truly care about the customer or feedback for improvement. Very disappointed.	positive
3862	463630399	lifestyle	3	I love going to pink! Pink is one of my favorite stores to go to and due to the deals I thought why not download the app? After opening the app, and beginning to use it, I noticed that the app was quite slow. I would constantly scroll up or down to look at products and the screen wouldn't move! Any time I'd *lightly* touch the screen to scroll down it would click on a random product I didn't want to view. When I would try to press the back button to get out, it wouldn't move and then the screen would black out and send me to my home screen. Even though this app is quite glitchy, I learned to be a little more patient and just put up with the app being slow. I love shopping at pink, so no matter how slow the app is, I'll still continue shopping there and using the appüëçüèªüíò	positive
3863	463630399	lifestyle	5	There are a few little hiccups that I don't like about the app. For example the back button will sometimes take me all the way back to the home button or will clear my filters while I'm shopping, and at times can be slow if you don't constantly update the app... HOWEVER! The extra little sneak peeks that you get to see as a member are literally so worth it! You also get little coupons that can be used both in store and online. If you love pink/Victoria's secret and don't have a store down the street from you this is definitely the app for you. You get to see all the upcoming deals that you would normally miss. Honestly just download it üíÅ	positive
3864	463630399	lifestyle	3	I like using the app because it can be easy to navigate, and I pre-shop sometimes before going to the store. I like being a member of Pink Nation and getting great deals and rewards-I am also a card holder. However, I can't even count times the app has crashed, it takes forever to load or go between pics and items. When I finally get to the item I want to see, it's sold out or the pic is only one view or one color. There have been so many frustrating times when I want to see both sides to a pair of joggers-front and back, or all the colors to see what it would look like on a person. Pink-VS-i think you can do better. If we are paying $45-60 for a hoodie or a pair of joggers, don't you think we actually want to see what they look like?	positive
3865	463630399	lifestyle	3	I really love this app because I can see other items that aren‚Äôt available at my Victoria‚Äôs Secret/ Pink, but when I go to buy something it takes FOREVER for the page to load. Not only that, I‚Äôve cleared out the app from my home screen to restart the app and it still takes forever. I can‚Äôt buy anything from this app because the checkout page will not load at all. If I want anything I‚Äôll have to go to my store and see if they can order my items for me. It‚Äôs a huge hassle. Please fix the app because I would love to be able to look at everything the store has to offer and order it on my phone instead of driving to my store to order items that I should be able to do on my phone.	positive

The weirdest part is that I have had this same problem with their website lately. I thought it could be my phone, but I‚Äôve tried using both platforms on other devices and I ran into the same problem each time.

3869	463630399	lifestyle	2	This would be a good app for Victoria‚Äôs Secret and PINK, but it fails to show that by it being slow and laggy. There are sales going on right now so I got on the app to see. At first, there were no problems; I signed in okay and it wasn‚Äôt slow/laggy. I lost my place in the app and went back to the explore page and immediately it made me sign in again. I tried to sign in and it let me, but then the sign in page showed up yet again. I try this for about five times and that‚Äôs all it will let me do now. About two weeks ago, it kept telling me that my email/password wasn‚Äôt right and I had to go to the website to fix it. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if people stopped using the app because of all its slow/lag/sign-in issues. It‚Äôs asinine and a waste of time anymore.	negative

3871	463630399	lifestyle	3	I seriously love Pink leggings!! The love the high waste feel. And how crazy confident they make me feel covering my little roll on the bottom of my belly. I have ordered many pairs of their leggings over the years! And I love everyone I‚Äôve ever gotten. But it seems like pink is loosing their leggins that appeal to me. And are going for more of an athletic look. Or a cozy jogging look. I love the plain logo pink leggings. And when I find a pair, that I‚Äôm actually interested in, they never have my size. I wear a size Large, and apparently so do many other women. And the looks that a like, a lot of other women must like them too.

 I do love shopping at Victoria secret and I do love shopping at Pink. And because I love their clothes, I downloaded the app. And this review doesn‚Äôt reflect the brand, it reflects the app. It is slow and unresponsive. Once, I tried looking at sport bras except they wouldn‚Äôt load. I ended up not getting one. And the website isn‚Äôt much better. The app does have perks, though. Ergo, two stars instead of one. It helps me stay informed about purchases and sales and lists if the deals are redeemable online and/or in stores. However, compared to other shopping apps out there, the Pink Vs app just doesn‚Äôt cut it."	positive

It has exclusive deals for PINK NATION members, and all of the normal deals in-store and online. Also, It has a game to play which I don‚Äôt use much but is a nice detail! There is also a feature to show you the weather of your city if you allow location! Has free wallpapers. One last great detail is having all your likes stored on an easy to open app! Only complaint is it‚Äôs a really slow app, also very glitchy but besides that it‚Äôs fine. Thanks for creating this, am excited to keep using it. It‚Äôs best to be a PINK NATION member to get deals, so become one!	positive
3874	463630399	lifestyle	4	I love it! Very useful to view the new clothes but the only thing is I wish they could provide a better way to organize the app so it‚Äôs easier to see all the options and know what sale is going on. Bc for example, I saw the 15% sake for college students still on the app, so when I went in the store and asked if they still had the sale going, they told me no that was in the month of May. So I just hope you clarify what‚Äôs new and sales going on as well as lower your prices bc it‚Äôs very expensive sometimes. But other than that, I love your store as a regular customer and look forward to new exciting great deals! :)	positive

     I don‚Äôt fine they app is as slow as ppl say, however I usually use it when connected to WiFi but today I tried it in the car and only one thing loaded.

It‚Äôs not like how if you shop on the forever 21 app or urban outfitters app or any other app. A browser literally loads whenever you‚Äôre trying to shop on this app. If that‚Äôs the case I can just shop online. Also if you login  online and login on the app you‚Äôll get logged out of one of them depending on which device you‚Äôre using which is extremely frustrating. Also it‚Äôs very difficult to view your cart on this app as well as online. You can‚Äôt get a full overview of the cart. It‚Äôs basically a side panel. This app just needs a complete revamp.	negative

Then I can buy it there or I can go to the store. I also love it because it's not like a website where you have to search it up every time you want to look at something instead you just push the app, and there you go.	positive

The app is so slow , and you have to constantly hit the back button to go back to your previous page. I‚Äôve had to close out the app several times just to redo what I was doing. I love PINK , but the slowness of this app is completely unacceptable. I hope the issue is fixed soon because dealing with this issue is completely frustrating.	positive
3883	463630399	lifestyle	5	I love Pink and using apps compared to the actual browser site but the pink app definitely needs work. Every single time  I put my login information in the app to check out, the app does not remember my account information and automatically pulls up my demographics such as my name, address, phone number, and email address. I have to always check out on the browser because for some reason the app doesn‚Äôt automatically  pull my information on the check out page.	positive
3884	463630399	lifestyle	5	Two weeks ago I purchased lots of stuff exchanged one thing and the girl did not put my grandkids pants in bag I called and went back several times they will not will not give me my pants 43  bucks I went into store 5 X out of my way and they think it‚Äôs funny I don‚Äôt again in store Monday to buy 3 Sherpa jackets I had a coupon for one 15 off they would not take it I called human resorted nothing has been resolved I want the pants I am not rich and I spent thousands in there I supply many kids with clothes who love pink than you elizabeth	positive
3885	463630399	lifestyle	1	Make an actual app. This web based bs is trash. Sort your panties properly, I don‚Äôt want to see 10 different listings for each pair just because they‚Äôre a different color. Just write ‚Äúmultiple colors‚Äù and we‚Äôll look at the other colors. When I click ‚Äúback‚Äù I should be brought back to where I was, not the top of the page I was scrolling to. I also shouldn‚Äôt be able to pan left/right or zoom in/out while scrolling through inventory when it‚Äôs just 2 columns that fit horizontally in the field of view. And for the love of all that is underwear, please create a free ship to store option like every other company. No one wants to go to the store and sort through 60 piles to try finding all the pairs they saw online.	positive

I went to play today and the names also haven‚Äôt changed since Wednesday. Didn‚Äôt think much of it until I played a game, and I kept getting +5 moves and I would never go under 20 moves. I was getting a lot of other power ups as well. When I reached 55,000 points with 24 moves left. It only boosted me to 63,000.... the 10 place person has 91,000.... how?
This game is rigged. I don‚Äôt like it when corrupt companies do stuff like this. So app only gets 2 stars."	positive
3887	463630399	lifestyle	1	I log in and all my info is entered and saved no problem. Try to make a purchase that‚Äôs when the trouble starts. I pick the merchandise I want click checkout it wants me to enter all my info again (already saved it) next wants me to enter my credit card info (already saved it) then it says review your order click on that and sends me all the way back to the beginning wanting me to enter my name again. After going through this 3 times thinking maybe a clicked the wrong button. I am going to delete the app not worth the headache. I am just going to go to the store to make my purchase. You think they would make sure you could actually make a purchase from the app. They are loosing money	positive
3888	463630399	lifestyle	5	The app isn‚Äôt user friendly most of the time it won‚Äôt let me log in, I have to go to my VS app and use it to get to the pink Nations appü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It‚Äôs really frustrating and it drives me insane going to a item clicking on it and then it tells me not in stock, if it‚Äôs not in stock why are you showing it? I‚Äôve ride or die with VS for almost 20yrs now my credit limit is insane but I cannot use it online cause the app crashes to much. I‚Äôm using a iPhone 7S plus and this is the only app I have issues with	negative
3889	463630399	lifestyle	3	Honestly, this app has its few up and downs. As a VS and PINK fan, I was so excited to download this app. But, the scanner doesn‚Äôt work and it crashes. I get the scanner paper when I order something (not from the app) and I try to scan it but it takes ages and never works. The app crashes when I‚Äôm usually looking through the items or go to a different category. This would be a big help if you could fix these things. Some people say the app is slow but I haven‚Äôt personally experienced it, so I can‚Äôt say anything. For now, 3 stars; but it could be 5 stars if you fix our problems.	positive
3890	463630399	lifestyle	5	Hi. My names Hailey. I just got interested in the brand ‚Äúpink‚Äù their underwear are soft and comfortable their items are adorable. I wanted to get the pink nation app so I downloaded it and I wanted to become a member. I put in my email address I made sure I did it correctly... I used my iCloud first didn‚Äôt work then I tried my gmail and it didn‚Äôt work. The message that pops up is ‚Äúoops... something went wrong try again later‚Äù but my WiFi is okay and my cellular data is unlimited so it has to be the appüòïüò¢	negative
3891	463630399	lifestyle	2	If you're a type of person who chose comfort over brand names, this is not the one for you. Don't get me wrong! The fabric they use are okay but I don't see why do I need to pay for $25 or so for a shirt than buying it somewhere else for less than $10 and get a good quality of fabric. You're pretty much paying for the brand name than the item you're purchasing. About this mobile app, everytime I check things out here; the app will always redirect me to update their app. I don't get those issues with any other online shopping app that I have. Honestly, its time consuming specially when I‚Äôm just trying to find something mostly on my breaks from work.	positive
3892	463630399	lifestyle	4	The app is amazing overall but for some reason there‚Äôs an option for Touch ID so I‚Äôm assuming if I get out the app and you know I would like to come back to it the next day I would be able to use my fingerprint to open it...no. I have to keep signing in through typing my whole email and my password so I just find it a bit odd to add the feature of Touch ID if there‚Äôs no use of it. Just wish it worked so I don‚Äôt have to keep typing my whole info to get in. But the app is still great in the end.	positive
3893	463630399	lifestyle	3	I‚Äôve had this app for years now. Lately it has been signing me out every single time I use it. I open it & it asks me if I want to join PINK nation or sign in. I‚Äôve already clicked the button to use Touch ID but it never asks for that. It makes me sign in every time I open it. The app runs very slowly. Now it is telling me my screen is having trouble loading & to try again. My WiFi is on and working & my data is also on, so it‚Äôs not my end that is not working. Is there any way to fix the app so it doesn‚Äôt make me, and others I assume, sign in every time I open it? To make it run quicker?	negative
3894	463630399	lifestyle	4	I love the app and getting notifications on the newest sales or deals. The only problems I have with it is the app does freeze quite often when trying to place a order and I wish once an item was in your cart prior to checking out that it could be held there for 20-30 minutes while you continue browsing. It‚Äôs a little frustrating when you have the items you really want in your cart and go to check out and then it‚Äôs sold out with no warning. But other than that it‚Äôs a great app and I love it	positive
3895	463630399	lifestyle	5	The other day Black Friday eve I had the worst experience I‚Äôve ever had!! I was trying to get the Sherpa top/sweater in a specific color and was also trying to get my discount. I got neither one because it kept magically disappearing when I went to check out. Now I‚Äôm out to gifts and I‚Äôm really frustrated. So much so that‚ÄôI may cancel my membership. I haven‚Äôt been getting my updates on sales or freebies in the mail either I do I‚Äôm one truly disappointed customer.	negative
3896	463630399	lifestyle	5	While I love the app I do not enjoy using it for ordering. I consistently have issues with my password and after I reset it or clear my cookies it won‚Äôt accept my reset password! Frustrating to say the least! The VS app is even worse! Not too mention the trouble with trying to redeem the promotional codes...I usually give up and don‚Äôt end up ordering or just use my web browser... Please fix the issues with ordering from your app then it would be a 5 star rating	positive
3897	463630399	lifestyle	3	"I‚Äôve found the app to work when it wants to, very frustrating.
I‚Äôm very disappointed in my last purchase, Sherpa lined is not fully Sherpa lined.  Why why why can‚Äôt you make coats the way you used to ??  I have 2 coats from years ago from you, that are fully Sherpa lined.  But you don‚Äôt make them anymore, I have found in over 10 years of being a card holder.  Quality has gone way way down, yet prices are way way up.  Why I have not shopped as much as I have for the last 10 years, 90% of my clothes are VS.   So sad, continues I won‚Äôt be a customer much longer.  That‚Äôs sad"	negative
3898	463630399	lifestyle	3	I shop in PINK 24/7, but everytime I attempt to buy anything offline I will put in my information, then it crashes and kicks me out every time. Me having the app is almost pointless if I can't even buy stuff off of it. But anyways your discounts could be a little better to you know ...instead of 10% off maybe a good 10 dollars off will be highly appreciated  üòÇbut anyways, you guys bras are great but 32 dollars for one bra is a lot and kind of over priced to me which is why I only own two pair sadly üò™. I love this store, and I will keep shopping here and hope for more improvements. üòÅ	positive
3899	463630399	lifestyle	3	I am very confused on why it does not have a wishlist or favorite list? I downloaded this app a while ago and noticed it then but deleted it hoping in the future it will be fixed. Since this whole staying at home quarantine has been going on I had to do my clothes shopping online. I decided to download the app again hoping this time it will be different. I am disappointed that it is still the same. It is so frustrating when you like something and you can‚Äôt save it for later. I love Pink and really want to love this app too. I REALLY hope they fix this problem.	positive
3900	463630399	lifestyle	2	it‚Äôs a great app for window shopping online but the moment you want to buy something it starts to freak out. I can‚Äôt delete stuff from my cart because it keeps popping back up, and I can‚Äôt even checkout because it just takes me back to my cart. None of my other shopping apps have ever been this terrible, and I‚Äôm not even saying this happened once, i have never been able to buy anything from the pink app, and it‚Äôs been years since I had the app. Often I‚Äôve just given up on it. I‚Äôve never written a review for an app before but honestly fix this will you or you‚Äôre gonna lose me as a customer.	negative
