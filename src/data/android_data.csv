com.herzick.houseparty,I like it so far! It is a great app to use during social distancing for sure! It keeps you connected to friends and family that lives outside of your home. I would like to see more games if possible and filters fun ones as well as ones that make you look better when you get an unexpected request and you're a mess! Lmao😂 Thank you to the developers of this app! Great job and what great timing!!!,4,5,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"I have the OnePlus 7 Pro phone which features a pop-up selfie-camera. I can tell you, this app constantly messes with the camera, and it's super frustrating. It doesn't need to use my camera when I'm not engaged in any actives, and just changing settings and adding friends. 😡 And for others, it's a privacy concern when an app is constantly turning on the camera for use. For me it's obvious, but for many people, they wouldn't even know... and the app could be watching.",2,50,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"This is a great app, great concept, my only complaint is that if you want to be with more than 2 people in the call, the app starts to freeze for everybody especially during games. So is not friendly for more than 2 people calls",3,32,social
com.herzick.houseparty,It is a very useful and wonderful app over all but I just wanted to write about something that could be useful to many people including myself along with the app. I think that there should be an update to allow more people in a room at once. I know personally I would like to talk to more then 8 friends at once so maybe it could be possible to allow more people in the room. Like I said it's an overall great app that is just what I would like to see in the future.,4,0,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"Certain parts of this are great, the concept and ease at which it allows you to just hop on and hang out with friends, the games as well. But it's very under developed. Quizzes get quite repetitive, the settings menu isn't anywhere near fleshed out enough for a calling app and the UI isn't great. I urge the developer to do all they can to capitalise on its new found popularity because this app could be a staple going forward if it's worked on. Also I've had absolutely no privacy concerns",3,165,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"I've used this app just once while talking with my daughter. Clear video and sound quality! Also a great way to visually share information/ideas. A great tool for visiting and following up with loved ones anywhere! There are games included in the app where loved ones could spend time visiting, having fun, and still being safe. Finally, I further understand that ""group"" calls are possible!? This will be my next venture!",5,98,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"Great. Very reminiscent of Skype on computers back in the day with the addition of games that can be played by all people participating in the call. We did notice a glitch that happened about two and a half hours into a call. Pretty much everyone's camera started flickering. A few people's cameras turned pink. Only way we were able to Force stop the app and clear our caches. Not all that bothersome, really. Not even sure if it was a problem with the program lol",4,73,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"Fine for quick video chats, but I can't turn off the volume! I can mute my mic, great. But even when I turn the volume all the way down on my phone, set to silent mode, I still get the voices of everyone in the call. This is fine if you are alone, but if me and my wife both want to get in on the house party on different phones, it causes horrible horrible feedback loops.",2,109,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"Cool app to play simple games with friends or family. The problem is that when you connect to the app, it sends an notification to all your friends with this game. If you're on the app then they can just enter without you accepting anything. The worse thing is not that it takes decisions for you but the fact that there's not even permanent settings to stop people from entering your personal space.",2,77,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"I don't rate apps a lot, but I really enjoy this one. It makes me feel much closer to my friends. I'd like to see more games in the future but I get the feeling it's fairly new. It drains battery but I mean what do you expect, it's a group video chat app. I haven't encountered any bugs, and it seems to work pretty well, functionality wise. The UI I feel could use a little tweaking but that's a very minor gripe. I'd also like to see a share screen mode for sharing memes Fun app, 5*",5,336,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"A couple of people mentioned a lack of security, which had me concerned. But, when I fully checked it out on my phone, I saw some of the very features they saw are lacking. There's the ability to ""Send out My Notifications,"" "" Get my Friends Notifications,"" as well as Mute or Ghost someone. So, just have a close look and you might find all kinds of things you didn't know were there. So far, I like it, but I'm new to it. For now, I'm going to give it a 4 star rating.",4,135,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"Confusing interface, and somehow you wind up on a call with someone without touching anything. Also, the sound the notifications make whenever someone is calling or saying hi or whatever it is, is the most annoying, high pitched whistling sound ever.

com.herzick.houseparty,"Sadly our first Houseparty experience was an embarrassing failure - riven with bugs and limited user controls, this app is not ready for the market. It was for my wife’s 60th birthday – so kinda important to us. So my sons and I had trialled it three times. All worked well. But the actual function did not go well. After some false starts, I got everyone together and initiated a trivia quiz – only for the questions to disappear from the screen. What followed was a very frustrating half an hour where after a gap, answers would pop up on the screen with 4 x red crosses, then disappear then another answer in 30 seconds or so and so on. This experience was shared by all our guests. There was no way to intervene and so we waited for the quiz to finish but it never did. At the end of the game, unbidden, it rolled into another and so on. We tried logging out and back in – no better. In the end, very frustrated we resorted to Zoom.",1,184,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"This app is a very good app for friends and family. What makes the app special is that you can play games while you are on a call. I do think that they should add more game options like UNO or even a board game. My one thing is about my privacy. The app is not encrypted which is interesting. Most apps already have encryption buit in. Sure you can lock the room but I feel like that's not enough. Overall, I didn't have any issues or bugs. Very good and creative app.",5,608,social

My only problem is after I accept new friends, they normally have mutual friends that pop up and they can become your friend.

com.herzick.houseparty,"Great concept We had a lot of fun AT FIRST (and this is in a one night time frame) then everything started to repeat. There wasnt enough variety to make this lasting fun. I even noticed in the trivia that one of the answers was wrong. Could have been more, but one for a fact. The question was on the Harry Potter trivia. Who was Marge's sibiling? Well that would have been Mr. Dursley, but they said the answer was Mrs. Dursley. Wrong! Mrs. Dursleys sibling was in fact Lily Potter, not Marge.",3,93,social

com.herzick.houseparty,"Cool concept, but app layout is bizarre and not user friendly. The draw something equivalent game doesn't register many touches and is pretty awful but is fun regardless when you're not having any social interaction.

I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app and the issue is persistent. It's also annoying that I cannot start a game, with friends, while using my laptop, as opposed to my cell phone. This app drains my phone battery quite quickly so I prefer to use a computer.",3,276,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"I've used this several times now with friends, and I really like it. It's been a smooth experience. For those complaining about it draining your batteries, I'd say that's kind of a given with any kind of video-based app. I just plug my phone in when I use it. I like how convenient it is, and it's been really nice quality every time.",5,24,social
com.herzick.houseparty,"Not the best. I had a nice 5-6 hour long chat with no breaks, yet the audio was hard to hear because it cut out a lot. Maybe I hadn't figured out the app entirely with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A, but when playing Chips and Guac the card descriptions are cut off and the cards themselves are extriemely small so they only take up about the length of my thumb.

Great idea, I can see where some of the features are in the process of being added to the app that aren't clickable yet(purchasable games I presume is one). Glitches out a little bit on certain devices, my friend was having troubles with his iPad being signed in on other devices and it was glitching a bit on my S10 when joining friends. It does eat battery on the S10 which is saying a lot and that can be improved. I would love to see maybe some adult age gated drinking games.",3,351,social

com.herzick.houseparty,This app is really great. The picture is super smooth and the games are great. You can ignore people and lock your rooms which is handy.

com.facebook.katana,"April 2020 Update: Well, as of a few months ago, I'm finally able to open up my photo via my home feed and/or news feed without it ""freezing"" anymore. Now there is a new issue. I can see some of my pictures in an album with 80ish photos. I could scroll down maybe roughly 15 pictures then i get the spinning icon letting me know it's trying to load the next pictures, but it's really not. I have tried to test this on other android phones I have and they're at acting the same way. Now I try to look at the album using my iPhone and that works just fine. I'm leaning more and more towards iPhone now just because of how buggy these android apps are and bloatwares. Another thing, Facebook's new algorithm on who it thinks should see your posts is terrible. Only a fraction of my friends and family are seeing my posts now because your algorithm doesn't want to ""spam"" people with posts it thinks people wont want to see; meaning my posts. THENNNN you guys shove a bunch of paid ads into our faces instead?? 2019 Reveiw: After digging deep into the phone clearing out so much data and cached files, testing it with other phones, and etc, I have finally found the answer.. It was the Android Facebook update. Clicking a picture from my news feed that has multiple pictures kind of freezes the app. You can press the back button on the Android phone to unfreeze it. The average person that clicks on my picture via their home feed would probably think their app is frozen and close it out then open up again then wouldn't see my new posts with my travel pics anymore on their news feed since it was already shown on their feed. I have confirmed this is the case only with Androids so far testing it on 5 Androids unsuccessfully looking at my albums via the feed. iPhone users still can view photos via the feed, though. I do see another recent review saying the same thing. The work around for this, which I know people wont do unless they really like you or know you, would be to go to my the person's page, click on Photos, then choose that specific album they want to see.

com.discord,"Pretty good app that gets the job done if you're not on PC. However, I'm really not a fan of the new update. The message typing box clashes with the usual Discord look and feel, and the little drawer on the side for sharing media? Clunky and annoying.

com.xmgame.savethegirl,"Im not patient, but with this app with the ads i am because the game shows good ads and thats why i have so many games on my phone right now. You might not know this, but every single ad, is trying to sell you something or make you get a game witch in my opinion its not that great because a ad in the middile of your game? Complete waste of time if your not going to get the game. But for me, its a 5 star review.",5,194,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"This is a very addictive game, it is very fun and sometimes humorous. However I give it A 3 star rating because of the ads,I understand that you are trying to make money but if you can please decrease the amount of ads then that would be amazing😄 but again the game is a great game and I'm really happy that it isn't like gardenscape and fish dom ads where the people who made that game are just fakers when it comes to advertising.",3,319,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"Absolutely horrible. The game might have been a little fun but the fact that you hace yo eeap with 2 ads after every level that you may or may not be able to skip through. If that isnt bad enough. If you click the claim button before you read everything, you havebto go through 2 more ads. And these are the ads that make you watch the whole thing, then another 5-15 of an additional ad. There is a thing called ""too much"", you greedy knobs.",2,263,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,I like it is fun you can play it it has a lot of ads tho so one problem turn off the internet ads dont work without the internet one simple thing to do i do not care that much if you can play it im fine actuly i hate it it is glichy on tablets i have a tablet i hate ia so much it is garbige im sorry if i spelt it wrong but still i hate it like it is a rat in real life so ya do not install it do not recomend it at all,1,9,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,This game is terrible All you see is ads ads and more ads!! I think overall I spent my time watching more ads than actually playing the game. I downloaded most of the games on the ads and am deleting this game. I do not recommend!!,1,1,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"This game is kinda okay. Sometimes it doesn't make sense, like the choices will be stupid, irrelevant and the main reason that I started to literally hate it is because of the ads. So many ads that I developed a strong hatred. I generally don't give reviews but this idiotic game made me do it. If u want to download it I wouldn't recommend it. Now I'm going to uninstall this.",1,169,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"Rated for 16+ it should be 6+ because this is the most childish game... it's so weird, mainly meant for 6-9 year olds and the ads are really annoying.... I disapprove of this game. Its graphics, the options, the ads are too much, you have to pay to go to the next level when you get to a certain point, rated 16+ when it should be 6+ and I dont recommend at all... plus their ads sometimes have people saying ""Its so cool!!"" ""Play this game it's so fun and it keeps you busy"" and I bet they brainwash",1,112,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"Love the concept but the ads are ridiculous. I get you have to make money but wow!! And you can choose to watch an ad or pay 200. In game gold if you lose and want to play the level again, Tip... Watch to ad because if you choose to pay the in game gold you are still going to watch an ad so don't waste your gold. Anyway game is fun but the ads kill it for me I'm going to uninstall.",2,170,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"The other comments (in my opinion) rate this game way too highly! The ads aren't even one per level, since the devs made each, ""level"" feel like a small section of an actual full length level. Think of it as if you were playing Temple Run, but each time you turn a corner an add pops up. The gameplay is also EXTREMELY repetitive and gets really boring REALLY fast. So I would say just skipping out and playing anything but this.",1,117,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"Terrible. I would recommend to play this game without internet open because otherwise you will mostly watch adds. Secondly, the second part of the game doesn't even make sense. The game starts okeish with some clever puzzles but overtime they won't make any sense and you'll start just random clicking. On the positive note though, this game is not a pay to win one. The gold is mostly for cosmetic perks. So in conclusion: tons of adds, great beginning, no pay to win. Give it a try but without wifi",2,98,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"Honestly the ads just ruin this game. It would be great if an ad didn't play after every single level, regardless if you win or lose. I was looking forward to playing but can't handle these type of ads. There's other ways to include apps in your game without having them pop up all the time. Try including it in the top of the screen during gameplay or something, not the way it is now. Even an ad after every few levels would be so much better and tolerable.",1,71,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"I am trying to be thankful right now, almost about to give you 2 stars bow, I won't give you all 3, the only bad thing for me about this game is too many ads you pay something on this game, you get an ad the whole freaking time. And I hate it when you got kidnapped, died, you have to watch another ad, everything else was good. I'll let you can change the character design her own house.I like it, it changed all the time, so you'll have the same thing every time in the same level, they changed it",3,75,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"As said in a TON of other comments this game has so many ads it's insane. Each ""level"" is one choice and after each ""level"" even if you pass and or fail you have to watch an ad...its insane. Save yourself the time DO NOT get this game.",1,2,games

com.xmgame.savethegirl,"The game I was looking for when I tried those ***scapes games! (Reported Playrix to the FTC, BTW.) Don't want the ads? Turn off WiFi/data. I turn them on periodically for you guys to get some revenue though. My only complaint: it's too short! I finished all the levels in a couple of hours. Perhaps add new levels in future updates?",5,138,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,the app seemed like a fun concept to kill time but the incessant ads that pop up even when you don't do anything that cannot be closed are far too much. the game play itself is impeded by an ad every few seconds. but the deal breaker was the level where the girl is on the island and the racist caricature of the black island native is just disgusting. I won't play anymore after seeing that BS. this app should be removed for including such insensitive and blatant racist stereotypes. shameful!,1,95,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"I love this app! Finally, something that isn't a scam!! But can you make the girl, a bit like a girl? I like the graphics of the game but the girl seems messed up. She looks a lot like a hideous boy! All you have to do is fix her dress 'cause there's that line on her chest that every mom will yell at kids if they draw it on their characters and her hair looks like nothing about a girl and make her eyes look like a girl.

Unacceptable.",1,147,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,I thought the game looked fun BUT I've only been playing it for about 2 minutes and already had to put up with 7 ads. Couldn't even finish the second level because an ad started right in the middle of it. Immediatly after the ad it asked me for my rating so here it is - Don't bother to download it. I know they need revenue but this is ridiculous. At the very least you should be able to finish a level Before the ads start. Too bad. Looked fun. Uninstalling.,1,646,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"I went ahead and bought no ads for $2.99. What I discovered was a game soooo lame... they owe me 20 bucks. You have to choose the dumbest option for each scenario to get through. And there was a small glimmer of hope when they asked some trivia-like questions to get past one level, but then immediately reverted to the idiocy. It only gets 2 stars because at least it wasn't click bait and was actually game play as advertised. I would love a game like this that offered intellectual choices.",2,149,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"Finally a decision game, but.. it's impossible to get into the game flow or to enjoy it, if every scene of the game takes about 5 secs and then starts a 20 sec advert. I can understand that free games need adverts, but this is too much. When u have just managed to be back in the game, it's already back to adverts. This is no fun playing sorry. I will delete it again 😒 Shame really because you were the first who didn't only show this decision game as an advert scam, but you really made one.",2,117,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,"This game is awful! Every 30 seconds is another ad. I spent more time clicking ads away than actually playing. Win a level? Ad. Lose a level? Ad! The popups are enraging!

But pros are it's a fun game, It's kinda stupid and funny. Cons tho are that their are a lot of ads and I wish they would add more thing to do because after the stupid and funny it gets boring. Make more but ones that make sense like the ones they show in the fake videos.",4,70,games

But when I saw an add for THIS I quickly looked it up and got the game! It's a really good game. People say it has to many ads but all you have to do is put it on airplane mode and there will be no ads😊 the only problem is there are not many levels and I finished already even though I got the game yesterday 😟 other than that it's 👍,5,219,games

NON EFFING SENSE. hate to be rude, but this made me angry. no common sense at all! Zero stars!",1,74,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,The Game is awesome......... The Game has 98 levels. Some of the times the choices are bizzare but all in all a nice game. Just turn off your data otherwise you will have to face a lot of ads. Ads are for saving yourself if you choose a wrong option or for claimomf skins for the character and in between levels. There is no need for skins or money (for me) because the game was for 98 levels and no need for money. Please developers... Keep om bringing these kind of games eventhough levels are less,5,97,games

Of course you need to earn money but that is too much ads and I ( and many of game players) would prefer if you were to minimize the ads and show them less frequently. Apart from that the game is great and I would give it 5 starts if not the ads. I'm sure you would prefer more positive reviews about how great the game is, surely you don't want game players complaining about ads. It would be great if you could do that.",3,43,games

I'm so sick and tired of these companies who release these games just to make EVEN MORE money by showing the same ads over and over and over. It's really getting out of control and there has to be a way to stop it from happening. I'm uninstalling this adware. ADWARE.,1,49,games

There should be more than 2 options to choose from, ones that actually make sense, and perhaps with labels to them so you know what the heck you're even looking at (like that a star-shaped spark is supposed to the sun and a dirty bucket is supposed to be cement). It would be nice if you actually had to think a way out of a clever situation. This is a good idea for a game but this version may be more interesting for kids, not adults.",2,46,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,I mean first I saw the advertisement of this game and finally got convinced to download it. It is really interesting but those billions of advertisements u guys upload while playing this game is ridiculous. After every play u have to wait until another ad finishes. U guys get the money out of those ads but to watch them is really irritating 😠 please just decrease them for the sake of us. I mean no hate but please try to understand 🌼🌺.,1,31,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,I love this game .As everybody says I also say the same that there is a lot of adds but you can turn off mobile data and play so that you may not find adds.This game is about a girl who should be saved. In this game in some position they ask us to make dicision.such as what will you do when a bear is coming how will you save the girl.there is two options that is to use a 🌹 or 🍯 .the anwer is rose the girl will take the rose and act like a dead body.Its a funny story game please try it.,5,59,games
com.xmgame.savethegirl,I love this game because it makes you think alot and it is so much fun but there are too many adverts. Every time I finish a level and it goes back to the home screen there is an advert. It is really annoying.

com.xmgame.savethegirl,There's so much ads!!! I can't play a single game because of this ads! Whenever you finish another level the will come!

I like it but SO MANY ADS AND THE LEVELS FINISH SO QUICKLY. it has levels and you play and after I guess 60-70 levels it starts repeating the levels and does not show even the notification that if you update then it will be fixed.

It's a widespread issue and I'm patiently waiting for it to be fixed, but it's starting to get annoying. Fantastic game, been playing it since release and still have a Snorlax from 2016. Get it and enjoy it if you have an older Samsung, but avoid at all costs on an S20. I'll put a 5 star back on once I can play again :)",5,161,games

com.nianticlabs.pokemongo,This is my absolute favorite game and niantic does a good job consistently rolling out new features.

If you get 5 wins in the league you could gain like 50 pokecoins or/and you could have your pokemon walk to gyms!

I will play games like this for an hour or two a day if there are just ads at the end of each level. Given even 1 hour, that'd be probably 30 ads. 12 once vs 30 daily. Do the math. Cut back the ads.

com.moonactive.coinmaster,This game was fun when I first started playing it But once you get on up there in levels there is no way to make enough money to complete the levels. You could be stuck on the same level for weeks even with playing it twice a day. I am ready to uninstall. There is no reason to continue playing if you can't make any progress without spending money. Which is what the makers of the game are hoping you will do!,1,14,games

Down to 1 star Fun game, but aggressively has too many price points, looks like spam all over the top portion of the phone screen. Too many ads.

com.moonactive.coinmaster,Very fun and addicting game. But there are many things that could be better. Once you get up so far things get more expensive yet you still get the same amount of skins for completing. When you get chests it's very hard to get collections because you get the same cards over and over and can't trade gold cards with ppl unless it's on the day that's allowed and then it's usually two hard cards that most ppl don't even have yet.

com.nike.plusgps,The guided runs are great and really helpful and I have started doing one on the regime's to improve my fitness which is also great.

It would be great if the audio coach could adapt to that and call whenever I finished the 800m and whenever the pause ends.

com.nike.plusgps,Love the app! Great programs and easy to use. My only gripe would be when you do the sprint portion of the program it's not guided. Ex: 9×200 you have to hit pause but you need to keep looking down to see if you hit the 200 Mt mark if you're not in a track. Not a big issue but would be nice if it let you know when you hit it or it autostopped and took your split,5,12,health_and_fitness

It wouldn't be such a big deal if I didn't have a goal of doing 100 miles in 30 runs. Instead, I got 100 miles in 31 runs and got jipped out of a quarter mile for when it didn't track my distance.

com.wsl.noom,"This app is AMAZING. it's literally saving my life. The only criticism I have us that when I Reach out to my coach he doesn't respond but idk if that's because I'm having a trial run. Also, the pedometer doesn't work very well. Only works when I have it open on my phone and I let the screen turn off, not as I'm on my phone for another reason while walking around. Other than that, I am beyond pleased with the tools, tips and use of psychology to help build better habits. Noom is #1.",4,38,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"It really is a helpful, different kind of weight loss program. The food logging, color system, informational articles, weight coach and group are all useful. I just finished three weeks and am only down a few pounds, but I've changed several behaviors. I plan to continue with it. That said - it seems here on the Google Play app that I can only download the app one time, on my phone, and I can't add it on my laptop. I'd like to have it in both places. Thanks!",4,20,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"I'm only on the trial, but I wish I had researched better. This ""new"" way to lose weight is missing key features most of the old ways have. 1) There is NO desktop app...that's right NO desktop app. For people who spend most of their days at a computer, this means you have to use your phone, even though you are probably already online on another device. 2) Android users cannot create recipes or meals to save things they eat regularly. HUH? We pay the same as Iphone users who DO have this important feature. So basically what you're paying for is a coach and color-coded food program. Lesson learned: more research before committing to something that will not serve my needs. I'll finish out my 2 week trial and cancel.",2,60,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"The program itself is well done, but the app is beyond terrible. They rarely update their list of known foods, and nutrition info is almost never accurate (great for tracking). If you try to add new foods, it will never be added to the app. Saved articles are sorted erratically, so it's nearly impossible to find what you're looking for. There's no way to track sodium, etc. I'd only recommend this program after they uplift their app. Perhaps the devs can reference Lose It to improve the quality.",2,26,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"I don't know why I took so long to commit after seeing so many ads! By far, the most comprehensive approach to health and overall wellness that I have ever seen. I'v tried keto, low carb, calorie counting, and other programs and they all work for a while, but this is the first plan that works with my brain to fix the decision making process that ultimately leads to long term success!!",5,6,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"I wish the food database was bigger, but other than that I really like this app. Good for tracking calories and workouts, but also the best at keeping me coming back everyday.

com.wsl.noom,I would actually rate this a 0 if I could. Today I decided to try the 'free trial' (that actually cost me £2). I have tried every way to access anything that would allow me to enter food or exercise and instead it keeps taking me into a loop asking the same questions and wanting to charge me again. I contacted their support numerous times and they weren't particularly helpful. You can only unsubscribe in the app and as I cannot access the app at all I will no doubt be charged in 13 days.,1,15,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"For the person who has tried everything else. Very easy to use app ( almost too simple, no back arrows) Fun language, like a party atmosphere for losing weight. If you stay longer than 2 weeks (why not it's worth it), team coaching increases your motivation and accountability. Love the daily food logging because there is hardly any label or food that it doesn't recognize (wish the scanner worked a little better). It has revolutionized the way I think about, and the attitude I have around food.",5,0,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"This app is flawed in so many ways. The calories in the food log are ridiculously inaccurate. The bar code scanner is even worse, I haven't found a single food that scans correctly. The pedometer doesn't work at all, then they tell you to download a different app and sync it to theirs and that doesn't work. The coaching is canned, scripted drivel. I was really excited for this program and app but I'm not seeing any reason to pay for a product that's broken.",1,3,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"I love this program. I'm not far from an ideal weight, but it still helped me get back on track to eat better and be more active. I love all of the research based information on healthy eating! Noom puts food in categories of red, yellow, and green, which helped me realize I was eating food that was too ""calorie dense"" too much of the time. I'm seeing results and feeling better, and the best part is I still get to eat treats occasionally. Free version is great, but paid version is worth it.",5,4,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"Noon is a great app.!!! I have only been on for a week now, but just knowing I can message my feeling for the day helps. There is do many helpful ideas and you just log into your phone!

I give it 10 stars!! :-)",5,2,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"I've been using it for 2 weeks so far. I downloaded just as I had started my weightloss journey. Have lost 6 pounds since starting using the app. I find it easier to log calories vs apps I've used in the past. It would be nice if the app saved all of the ""fill in the blanks"" for us un one tab with a link to original document. Then I can easily go back and reflect on my personalized goals and strategies. Noom tells us to eat lots of protein... then it should track our protein!",4,5,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"Enjoying my experience so far, but load times are horrendous. When opening via a notification (like a reminder to log a meal), there is no issue. When loading from home screen, i give up after 10 minutes. I have a Samsung Galaxy s9, using high speed wifi internet. Considering this is a paid service, this might be a deal breaker for pulling the trigger past the 2 week trial.",3,4,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"This app is good for tracking your weight and has a lot of reading involved in order to keep you ""on track"". The accountability is all web-based and doesn't feel real. If there was somebody calling once a week or twice-weekly it would be way more effective especially for the price. Also if you are a runner and run several times a week you can't track any of that on the app unless you have an Apple Watch or a Fitbit. For example if you have a Garmin Running watch it won't sync up.",2,2,health_and_fitness

As a licensed counselor, I recognize the cognitive-behavioral components of the program.",5,31,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"I really like this app and program so far! I love that I can see weight coming off, but I'm not hungry. It's a very intelligent plan, different than others I have tried. I have heard it compared to weight watchers, and it is similar in that you can eat anything in moderation. However, where noom improves on the ww plan is the different categories they put your food in. Therefore you can't eat zero point food all day in order to save up for a 16 point piece of cake before bed. Recommend!",5,16,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"Very ghetto. Would not recommend. I was really excited to try this program. Unfortunately, the Android capabilities for this app are limited in comparison to iPhone. Your access to the program is limited during the trial. They advertise a feature to log your own recipes, but that feature is not available on Android platforms. The pedometer is wildly inaccurate. The app is glitchy and tech support is only available via a one-time messaging and subsequent emails, which is not efficient.",1,9,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"It's been a great and positive experience starting with Noom. I've been ""Nooming"" now for 1 full month and it blows my mind how small changes in your daily routine can really make a difference. The things you learn cause self reflection and many ""Aha!!"" moments as to how you got to the weight you are. In one month, I've lost 8lbs and don't feel deprived or that I've made radical and unsustainable changes. If you've tried other dieting methods and have been unsuccessful try this!!!",5,2,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,This is the best Weight Loss experience I have had so far. The app is funny and always leaves me chuckling when I check it. Very grateful for the progress it is helping me make and for the psychological aspect. I have done weight watchers and lost the weight but the underlying cause of my weight gain remained so I eventually gained it all back. With this I feel I am fixing parts of my thought processes so I won't go back to where I was before.,5,1,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"Week 1......so far so good. I have lost, to date, about 16 lbs which is good. Much of the information is very useful, although some of it has honestly gone over my head. The pedometer needs a lot of work. It is very inaccurate. I am using another pedometer to supplement it. I love the division of food into color categories, which is giving me greater insight into what I am eating.",4,2,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,I am impressed. The concept is easy to understand and follow. It takes work on the user end to stay committed but don't worry they're here for you when you start to fall off. Would have been 5 stars but I'm an Android user and can't enter recipes of my own into the app. Only available for iOS users which is silly. I am satisfied with the focus this app has given me and I think with the Noom team's help I will reach my 50lb goal.,4,1,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"Love all the insights on how to eat, changed the way i look and eat food, thinking about food and seeing who else is feeling the same about how we eat. The coaches are great, the support of the other members of your group is fab. . And brilliant humor 🙂. Other diets say."" No don't eat that"" and you deprive your self of the foods you like. This gets boring, and you end up right back with all the weight. 🤨Noom is not a diet...... it's a new way of life. Noomnerd for life.",5,0,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"Program is ok. App is awful. At the 200$ price point, it's just not there yet. However, when I went to cancel my subscription, I was offered a discount of 19$/month no commitment. So, if you think it's too expensive, give this a try. I still decided to cancel because it wasn't worth even that in the current state of the app. I also bought the workout and meal plan - it's also fine but not worth what they charge. Lower price point and a substantially fixedup app and it wouldn't be bad.",2,0,health_and_fitness

Other than that, it's just reading Pinterest-level, superficial inspiration nonsense. That doesn't produce results. There's no real approach here. No dietary plan, no workout regimen, no stats to track other than calories. I won't count the pedometer because it's junk. Never works. I can't read the messages from the ""coach"". I think this is just a short-term scam, honestly.",1,1,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,The app is reasonably good and their information is fairly informative. Be aware though that if you dont want to continue with your trial cancel before the trial is over.

I HIGHLY recommend this app!",5,1,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"The content is great and pretty much on par with what I expected. The app isn't the greatest (there are more robust calorie counter/recipe inputs); I sometimes get issues where food items will save to the wrong meal (but it still counts for the right day, so no harm, no foul). I've had a fine experience and I'm still using it 7 weeks later.",4,8,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"I really love reading all the articles and learning the science and psychological side of getting and staying heathy. I love the colod system they have set for food logging. The being based caloric density is awesome, but I feel like some of the food isn't always labeled correctly.

com.wsl.noom,"I came back to Noom after a while because it helped me to lose weight years ago before I had my baby. This app is very different from how it used to be.

com.wsl.noom,"Love the program, logging meals so helpful. The downside is limited online coaching, takes days to get a reply, app could use more depth, i.e. place to record other info, I sometimes cant find food info on the app and cannot create it as I dont have all info for a food item, also appears to be American as limited info on Canadian foods and restaraunts, we pay the same, should be Canadian data as well. Having said that, I am enjoying it and so far quite successful",4,0,health_and_fitness
com.wsl.noom,"Articles are good as is the psychology aspect. The app itself is very poor. Food logging is unnecessarily tedious, the database is very limited and often wrong. No access to historical reports such as easily viewing calorie counts over time. BP logging appears to be meaningless as there are no reports. The hard stuff (psychology of weight loss) they do well.

Plus it's easy to edit your fasts if you forget to hit start or stop. I do kinda wish you could schedule a fast to start in advance also, but the fast reminders work well enough. The place that I think this app lacks though, is integration with other devices and apps. Yeah, it can sync to GoogleFit, but that's pretty limiting. I'd love to see it able to sync to other popular fitness apps and devices like FitBit and Nokia. And that's the only reason I'm taking one star off.

Oh, and out of the many fasting apps I've tried (I've tried so many) this is the only one I've found that's free AND doesn't have ads popping up all over. I was just looking for an app I could pay once to get rid of ads and this so far has blown my hopes out of the water. At least I hope, it's been 4 days so far and no ads yet, but another fasting app I used was similiar until a few days in and all of a sudden ads were everywhere and it made the app too annoying to use. And the only way to rid them was to pay a subscription. I deleted that app. So if that happens with Zero I will update my reveiw, but so far it seems great. My one request Zero developers (besides adding devices to sync with), is if you ever go a paid model, please don't go subscription.

I am referring to their strict cancellation policy where they used to indicated ""48 hours and 14 days before check in"" will receive full refund. However, they only took into consideration of 48 hours. Now, the policy is changed to that you can only get full refund if you cancel within 48 hours.

com.google.android.street,"My only real use of the Google Street View app, at present, is to submit my spherical panoramas, stiched and edited on my desktop computer, onto Google Maps. This has been done ever since Google disabled Street View submissions from desktop computers, a rather infuriating decision - not everyone uses mobile phones to take panoramas. Anyway, I attempted to take a few panoramas with the app and all have ended in spectacular failiure. It might be a hardware issue with my mobile phone (LG G4), but when taking the panorama, the alignment guides and the already-taken frames drift out of alignment. Eventually you will find that you have covered the full 360 degree rotation on the app, yet in reality you still have another 90 degrees to turn. Practically, this means that every frame is spread apart by a certain distance (albeit corrected in stitching), and a quarter of the panorama is missing! Attempts at covering the tiers above and below will intensify the horror, with one tier rotated 180 degrees from another. The stitching will not repair that, as you can imagine. Needless to say, this behaviour is intolerable and makes panorama-taking entirely impossible. I suspect that either the (very good) image stabilisation system in the camera, or the phone's gyroscopes are meddling with the app's operation. As for viewing panoramas, I noticed that the app had improved slightly since when I last used it for this purpose, with less intrusive ""cards"". It is still much easier on a desktop computer, however. The investigation into whether all phones are genuinely compatible with this app is required, because the LG G4 evidently is not! My old G3, with less hyperactive stabilisation, worked perfectly. It would also be nice to be able to submit my panoramas to Google Maps from my desktop again, instead of sending them to a comparitively inferior device. It seems logical, but I am probably pushing my luck with that.",2,37,travel

But this has to be done after they are already on public show. There is no option to publish and link photospheres for testing or private viewing, which is stupid as the first time you try it, and every time it messes up the uploading, your efforts are low-grade public content before you have even had a chance to edit them or improve your technique.

The UI/UX of the games and the app is also intuitive and fun to work with. However, I think this app can be improved by including excercises that develop the creative side of the brain too.

Because when I usually get on my 3rd lesson I usually want to play anouther game but I can only play the ones that I have already done and it gives you the same questions and if your like me you remember all the answers.

com.wonder,"This app is awesome! It has so many great qualities, that I don't even have time to touch on all of them, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone! Elevate is ad-free, fun, and offers personalized education targeting the areas in which you need the most improvement. I'm even considering purchasing the ""pro"" or premium content.",5,0,education
com.wonder,"Warning: Developers ""try"" to create a addict out of the game with a 7 day free time period. actually a 6 day time frame to cancel ""@ anytime"" but will charge you a huge ridiculous sum if dont cancel on time. Good luck NOT getting ripped off using this. It's not really free. only allows you to play less than a few games (3 to be exact) just to try, then...ask you to play for ""7 days free trials"", then you to pay when forget. It's a rip off Gimmick. ""Is not stealing because is legal""",1,4,education
com.wonder,"Updated review: I still think an annual subscription instead of a lifetime fee is ridiculous at that price. The app is very limited in the data it gives you (for example: you can't see how you've charted in a game over time unless you've JUST finished playing it). However, it has so far genuinely improved my expressive aphasia and made me 10x more confident in my math skills. Elevate also desperately needs to be made seizure friendly. ""Measuring"" is fun but unplayable bc of the flashing.",3,296,education
com.wonder,"I am not much of a gamer, but i like to learn English with fun. Another apps, like Duolingo, have just monotonous trainings. Here developers created games for the sake of fun. Great sound effects, also visual effects and statistics. Tons of games to choose in one app, I paid $21 for the year subscription. Free games are good, but they are short, and you cannot play what you want, only what is scheduled for you. I am very excited with such a variety of games. It's cool app!",5,26,education
com.wonder,"I am enjoying this app so much. Sometimes I feel nervous, like I am back in school, but I am 56 and need some help with all these categories.

Thank you Elevate!",5,1,education
com.wonder,"Engaging, enjoyable. Elevate inspires refinement, combining speed as well as accuracy in scoring. The animations add differentiation between the varying tasks, so the play feels fresh as you go from skill to skill. There is a rating feature that compares performance percentages with other players, for those who are curious about such things. Or who are competitive by nature. There are also personal skill level ratings going upwards of average by 3 more levels. Thumbs up... ready, set, go!",5,1,education

com.wonder,"The free version of Elevate is fun and helpful, with a wide variety of games to challenge your brain. *Edit* One year later, Elevate is still my favorite brain training app, and ive been using the paid version for about six mos. Sadly, in many games ive plateaued and my scores have begun to drift down. With most in the 90th or better percentile, a few are in the 40s or below, and 2 are in the teens. Interesting to see my cognitive weaknesses. Highly recommend!",5,1,education
com.wonder,"As someone who forgets words a lot, I feel like this is a good app to keep your mind active. When you have a short amount of time, it might be a good idea to open this app up instead of going on a different game or something. It's definitely helpful! It's also a very polished mobile game compared to most others, which is definitely a joy to see. This ain't no Raid: Shadow Legends.",5,114,education
com.wonder,"I've never seen a game with GRAMMAR- SPECIFIC exercises! It also teaches through audio or visual learning & sometimes both! It has a variety of games with specific objectives.

The best I've seen maybe once is ~45% off.",5,7,education
com.wonder,"I'm so sick of these apps calling themselves free when the only free thing is a teeny, tiny, dumbed down version.

I really would like to see the potential of the app.",5,9,education
com.wonder,"I like it. I really enjoyed my one-week trial and just paid the annual fee so I can play this game all year. It's challenging, there are plenty of games to choose from, and I feel good spending my time playing something that will sharpen my mind instead of wasting my time playing something that dumbs me down. For what amounts to less than $5/month, I feel it will be well worth the price over the next year. Looking forward to gaining mastery in all subjects! Time to Elevate my thinking! 🧠",5,42,education
com.wonder,"The app is very easy to use. They always ask for your feedback which helps with the learning games they design. I've been using the app for over a month now and it has helped me remember things I had forgotten over the years as well as newer things I was uneducated in. Overall I enjoy the app,helps keep my mind sharp.",5,2,education
com.wonder,Amazing App it helps alot while being engaging the only negative I have really come across is in the punctuation game with commas if you pick the wrong area your given one of the answers and it proceeds I dont think it should do that it should be counted as an error and shown at the end of that trial on the wrong location(s) and the correct one(s) if it's not a valid location for the punctuation then it should just state (invalid location). That's all so far.,4,7,education
com.wonder,The issues I had has been resolved and I would like to say that the app is really great and has so many games different from the ones I have seen before...I gave it four stars because the premium package is too expensive for me although I wish I could afford it and the free games are also very limited.,4,0,education
com.wonder,"I've seen plenty of ads for this learning / improvement app - none of which even hinted at the idea there was a cost Additionally, the cost is quite high - $40 a year. The results it gave me from my answers to their rudimentary questions were, quite simply put, B.S. I tested them by purposefully answering the math questions with all random choices, while the writing skills section I knew entirely - yet received the same score for both sections. Coincidence, or scam? Maybe a bit of both.",1,14,education
com.wonder,"Very streamlined, a lot more detail than other brain training games. The games/challenges are brilliant,, it also tells you where you are most advanced. The only thing I would change is the yearly cost and make it monthly, I'm not currently working so can't afford the yearly cost in one go, so I have given the 7 day free trial a go, even in the further info about the app, it says that elevate offers a 14 day trial and I only wish that I could continue with it.",4,248,education
com.wonder,"I really enjoyed this app, but the cost is a bit high. I also feel that having an option for untimed games, especially math-based, would have been more beneficial. The race against the clock heightened my anxiety and I would sometimes pick randomly, rather than genuinely figure out the answer. And while I appreciate the explanations given for incorrect answers, because they interrupted the flow, I would have preferred them at the end of the training. An ADHD version would be amazing!",4,34,education
com.wonder,"This Game is Wonderful!, Love the fact that how you can replay the games or activities you've done on the day! It is still pretty good considering the fact at how good the game is as I am not using the Pro Version! In Conclusion for me it is a 10/10!",5,0,education
com.wonder,"It's a nice game. But I downloaded it hoping I could change the language to German to better my German training and understanding. I think this is a great way to introduce yourself and find your level of how much of another language you really know. It does that much for me in English and i consider myself already a ""good enough"" English speaker. Please consider hiring a team of translators to get the app in different languages. Then you would surely get my money.",4,17,education
com.wonder,"Elevate - Brain Training Game is simply great and enjoyable. it keeps me engrossed. One of the best games that I have come across. I had given Elevate a 5 star rating even earlier. Now you can take it to be a 7 star rating from my side. I have tried other games, such as Lumosity. But most of the times I get the feeling that those games do not make me any more intelligent than what I am. In fact I get the feeling that their games treat you like a moron. Elevate is at a different level altogether.",5,2,education
com.wonder,"It's motivational and keeps me trying to better my score. It WAS very good but in the last few days it has stopped synchronising between my devices, so I am losing all my progress and the number of continuous days I have been using it.

Quick little note, I've always greatly disliked math. I've been working on that attitude, (I'm over 50), and actually ended up with math as my highest score. The after free trial price is probably fair honestly at $39.99 annually, however, I just don't have the funds for this at this time. I do need it for gas and groceries.",5,92,education

com.wonder,"*original review at bottom* Update - developers have been in touch to point out that I could have used the app anyway but I have now uninstalled it and no longer feel the urge to use it. Four stars due to a positive response from developers, though I do think that the app was misleading when first opened as it implied that all that was on offer was a free trial. **Original (incorrect) review: Bait and switch - not a free app but a free trial.",4,12,education
com.wonder,"I honestly wish this app was a bit more affordable, but to be honest it must be worth every penny. I'm an English teacher and this app helps me sharpen my skills. I love incorporate it to my private classes too! Students have found it to be a rewarding challenge.",5,1,education
com.wonder,Excellent UI. Enjoyable games. A few suggestions for improvement: A monthly option for PRO would be nice - I'd probably subscribe monthly. Progress is slow if your ability is far above the starting ability - should be an option to increase the difficulty or the rate of change in difficulty if you believe your ability is significantly above the current level. There is also a lot of brain training games in scientific literature - would be awesome if some of those could be brought to elevate.,4,2,education
com.wonder,Excellent App when I have some spare time to improve my skills. It's just 3 days into the app but I can already see the difference in my ways of working. I think I am able to consume oral data better and process it at much faster pace. 5 stars!,5,0,education
com.wonder,I really like it. It keeps my thinking game sharp. Only negative is why this game costs as much as it does.

com.wonder,"Some of the tasks are very challenging, which is good, but how they describe the game can be a little confusing. The game is really helping me with skills, and I'm glad I got it. The free version let's you do 3 games a day, which is better for me than frustrating myself by repeating levels that challenge me over and over and not get a better score. This app is better than the other brain skills apps I've tried. I highly recommend this app to anyone who would like a good daily challenge.",4,8,education
com.wonder,"Good and bad. Good at traing and teaching but not always in a good way. In the brevity training, it does teach brevity, but at the cost of poor communication.

I like this app, I haven't really used the webiste more than a handful of times so I can't compare that. On my phone (Pixel 2xl) everything is great, easy to navigate/edit, ALL of the photos are clear. On my chromebook (Lenovo) everything is still great EXCEPT when you click on a ""pin"" on a board the photo is really large and pixelated. CB settings havent changed anything. It's a compatibility issue I think.",4,41,lifestyle
com.pinterest,"As an introvert this platform is very individual [you can share with friends with a instant message option or a post an image to Facebook for example] but it also caters to all kinds of intrests and hobbies.. and with the organization of ""pins"" and ""boards"" you can ""put a pin"" in a category or ""board"" to save for later and make a collection of images and/or ideas.

Overall, after a few events that happened in my personal life, I had to delete the app. Now that I got it back, I cannot log into my account. I used the email and password I had on my account.

The categories Pinterest thinks I'm interested in based on my cookies data is WILD, and the app's ""back"" function is unstable, sometimes returning me to my home feed instead of moving back one history state.

For example, for a while I was randomly getting about 1/3 of my feed talking about raising backyard chickens (maybe because I was looking at chicken recipes?)

I'm pretty unhappy and will likely be uninstalling.",2,7,lifestyle
com.c2m.frankly,"I started playing this a few days ago, gotten tons of friends to play because it was super fun, but suddenly now you need to either pay or play a ton to get more games. I can't imagine how long it'll take me to get options again. Taking all the options but one and only giving 20 coins to start, not even enough for a single other thing, is dumb. I understand the need to monetize your work but this is a bit much, especially now.",2,68,lifestyle
com.c2m.frankly,This game was my go-to game since we started quarantine. I loved that the creators of the app were supporting self-isolation like that by enabling the video chat feature and still allowing you to play fun games with friends. There are no words for how disappointed I am about this update and it totally forfeits the good will I saw in the app before. It is awful to see how apparently everything is about money nowadays.

com.c2m.frankly,When I first downloaded this game it would have gotten 5 stars because it was a great way for my friends and I to stay entertained during this time but unfortunately it updated and now the format is earning coins (or purchasing coins) to unlock rounds we already played prior to the update. Takes the fun out of it when before you had the flexibility of picking whatever topic you wanted now you basically have to go in order and certain topicss may not cater to you.,1,7,lifestyle
com.c2m.frankly,"I absolutely LOVE the concept of this game. Only thing is the fact that its very glitchy. Typos in the questions to where sometimes we dont know what the person is asking us.

Sometimes the video glitches out between me and my friends, or sometimes they cant join me because it never leaves the home screen.

We just want to enjoy ourselves and adding the coins purchases makes that difficult. Very annoying.",1,29,lifestyle

com.c2m.frankly,The game is especially fun during quarantine but I find it annoying how the game keeps updating and making it harder to play.

Before the update me and my friend could all play together and have fun but when every game has coins you pay before playing what's the point.

Why would I pay for something when it doesnt even work in the first place. Zero stars, delete your app Bumble and start over",1,56,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,"At first this app was fun. It's hard to find people that want to be friends so I liked the concept but now it seems to have fallen flat.

Force stop and data clear has no effect on resolving issue. **oh and how could I forget the broken notifications.",2,61,lifestyle

com.bumble.app,"It can already be difficult to find a match, so when Bumble makes matches expire after one-two days, they are effectively preventing you from making a meaningful connection.

That is to say I didn't swipe right on everyone. Not getting any matches, I had three girls try to find me on Bumble to test if I am even visible. Even after filtering to my profile filters, they didn't find me until almost the very end of the queue. I understand not getting matches, that's just life, but for being one of the top online dating service, they have to either make all profiles equally visible or be more transparent about how their algorithm works. I am betting even after getting their paid service, they are relying on you to pay for the ""Spotlight"" bonus to make your profile even remotely visible. What a waste of time.",1,9,lifestyle

Edit: all notification settings are as they should be, both within the app and from Android's app settings.

What's the point of a dating app if it malfunctions all the time?",1,2,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,"I used to be on Bumble a long time ago! Back then, there was unlimited likes, and you could shake your phone up to 3 times to go back if you missed a like. They removed the unlimited likes, you get very low swipes and then you have to wait 24h for another limited swipe. Like this wasn't enough, they removed the ""three shakes"" to go back on a missed match.

You never match with those people though. I thought, ohh eventually I will come across them and if I do like them then we'll match but NOPE never do. Almost like they put fake people up just so you'll pay to see them.",1,15,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,So far so good. Most of the text interactions & follow up conversation seem legit. Easy app to figure out. My one HUGE peeve here..is that once you complete a tidbit in one of the 'profile prompts' that prompt CANNOT be removed from your profile. EVER. The user can only edit the content within. I changed my mind about wanting to share several of these..and now they are waste of space that say 'to answer later' or something to that effect. I feel slighty..slighted. I like that I reach out first.,4,3,lifestyle

So I came back the next day and found that my swipe limit was still reached. Day 3, my swipe limit is still reached. This is clearly a bug because I have swiped exactly zero times in 48 hours, so I reach out to support. What do I get? A condescending boiler plate email explaining why there is a swipe limit. Thanks, uninstalled.",1,133,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,"The app will give you notifications for messages after you've seen recent ones.

com.bumble.app,This app has an annoyingly short match expire timer. It lasts only a day. So if you don't check in or get a notification that you got a match then they're easy to miss. The app then let's you rematch for £2.50. It's a really scummy tactic since you're only buying an extension to the potential match and a sneaky auto subscription. The other person might not respond at all so it's clearly designed to take advantage of desperate people that will pay £2.50 to keep the hope of a match alive.,1,289,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,"Used to been great until they added the ""You've hit the end of the line -- for today!"". Missed it where I can swipe as many as I can without any restrictions.

The developers are Swift and didn't make it overly complicated for no reason, the layout and the design/method of matching I think is very good.. great idea.. Bad: there's not enough women on it, and in a city of 1.5 million people I ran out of matches in two days of swiping on the free version. Paying is a complete waste.. it feels like a complete money grab scam.",1,67,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,"This app is great and user friendly but has extreme flaws. Most of the matches I see on here are either instagram influencers trying to boost their following, narcissistists looking to get their attention and validation fix, or just straight up idle accounts.

You're better off staying single guys.",1,15,lifestyle

In conclusion, this app is a sexist waste of time.",1,6,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,"Overall it is a good app but the major drawback is that it forces you to communicate with a match within 24 hours. It basically guarantees that you can't really use the app if you're not going to have time to chat in a short window. And there is no general browse feature so if someone's profile comes up that you like, but you don't have time to talk, you either have to stop where you are and close the app, or swipe and risk losing the connection.",3,38,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,"One of the few decent dating apps, very few limits etc which makes it still really accessible if you don't want to pay for a subscription and it actually listens to your age and distance preferences etc.. the verification tool on profiles is also really nice to be reassured you arent wasting your time.

Reached out to their Support Team but they are not helping at all. Wasted my money. DO NOT DOWNLOAD OR BUY ANY SUBSCRIPTION FROM THIS APPS!!",1,35,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,I thought it was a good app until they took my account down. Apparently people can report me because I dont look old enough even though I am 20 years old.

Don't know how much limit is but I've and it so at 11pm it let me swipe again but only two people an hour later at 12 though okay should be better now nope only one person. It is pointless to use if it's a stupidly low amount you might as well add random people of Facebook or Instagram or Snapchat and message them.,1,1,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,"Not many users, I applied 1 filter with max distance but it always tells me that there is no more to swipe and I need to expand filter. Please add an ""don't show"" option in filter, especially in religion filter. I want to exclude a religion because I DONT wanna see women with hijab in my list.",3,1,lifestyle

The microtransactions for coins and mothly boosts are a bit dear.

I assumed she ghosted me for whatever reason but now I'm not sure. I noticed older matches I've had are suddenly disappearing today too, which is very odd. Is there something wrong with my profile or technical difficulties you guys are having?2 or 3 of the other people I had as matches, I haven't spoken to on Bumble in several months so, did they all just happen to unmatch today?",4,1,lifestyle

I have had a better experience with guys on this app just being generally more pleasant than those I came across on Tinder.

On Bumble, you get to see a bit more of someone else's personality than on Tinder which only features room for a bio and anthem.",5,1,lifestyle

So am questions does it work? Any1,1,1,lifestyle
com.bumble.app,It's a wonderful app with genuine profiles. It's way better than Tinder or its ilk. True to its objective it truly empowers women by leaving the ball in their court.

It also gives men the pleasure of receiving pickup lines from women! Highly recommended. Way to go Bumble!,5,1,lifestyle

com.nest.android,Would be nice to have a trend of the temperature in your house and outside throughout the day. Would also be nice if you could set lockouts on heating and cooling. I should be able to prevent my A/C from coming on if it's 40 outside but warm in my house from say cooking etc. Would save a lot of manual intervention.

Also could use an option to adjust temp in half degrees (ex: 68.5f or 72.5).

I have Arlo Smart premium and would like the ability to review the video clip that triggered the alert as an option in addition to going to the live video feed.

Problem also with if its been to long accessing the app or the playstore updates the app you may be getting alerts that are never pushed and notified. You might go a day or two and at some point wonder why you haven't gotten alerts to find out the app got updated and required a login Lastly I would like to see some functionality added for tamper and siren alerts for USB power.

com.arlo.app,Bad.. I mean it being wireless is great but no video!!! Late notifications. Wont record until after i step out of range of camera. Then when i go to vew video footage it dissapears out of no where! And says no data! I have a night owl system and i will be buying another to cover the rest of my property!!!! Im returning arlo and will not be buying from them again! If you want a fool proof and sturdy system buy night owl it is wired but best ive owned so far!,1,1,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,"App not working AGAIN after the update. Can you please fix this?? Its like every 3 months the app gets updated and then works like garbage. Or I should say doesn't work. After this last update, the app freezes or kicks me out of the app back to the log in screen. I reset the app, reset my phone, reset the base and still nothing. I turned off one camera yesterday and today I started getting random notifications stating that it's on and picked up motion. FIX THIS APP AND THE BASE SOFTWARE.",1,2,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,Arlo pro 2. It's a good system that works well when it works. Changed to 1 star only because live view is unavailable during a triggered event. If you get a notification of motion you can not connect to the camera while it is recording said event. And If you're watching the live feed and something triggers a notification the camera will freeze until the event is finished recording. Essentially you are blind at the most critical time. System crashes a lot.,1,9,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,"Arlo is slowly falling off my ""Go-to"" gadget list... The support SUCKS! I've got 5 cameras and 3 of them will no longer sync or work... Have tried several Google and YouTube searches for a fix but no luck... It's not like these little suckers are cheap either... I'm thinking of doing a NEGATIVE YouTube video to steer people clear unless I get some help soon!",1,0,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,The app is glitchy. It needs to be redone. Often you can't use the mic feature or click into a certain camera. Also tens to say it's offline when it's not. The cameras are great in the system is easy to set up. For the top-of-the-line system it should definitely have a better app behind it,3,1,lifestyle

Would have put no stars if I could.",1,1,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,"Hey guys, the app is broken again (crashes on login). Any chance we can get it fixed? - A forever regretful customer (Original review starts here) Even 1 star is basically being generous for Arlo and their team. First you have to buy a $200+ webcam and then you download the app and log in and it just crashes. Happens at least 50% of the time on every update. When the app does actually work video lags by 2mins. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND",1,3,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,Paid close to $1000 for these cameras and you can't get the damn video to play back!

You cant set alarms to go off only when people are detected instead of just moving trees etc, so alarm feature a bit useless. Totally disappointed with whole system",1,1,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,"If you haven't bought the product, I would strongly advise that you do NOT purchase it. The amount of glitches you have to deal with for the app will not be worth your while.

It used to work decently, but after the last couple of updates it takes about five minutes to connect to my camera video. Once it is connected, it frequently drops the connection.

com.arlo.app,Great features but rough around the edges. Each camera creates its own notification tab rather than being additional notifications in the same Arlo thread. Doesn't support dark mode or Google Pixel's face unlock either. Latest update also significantly slowed down loading times and broke the ability to play music from the baby monitor.,2,1,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,"Great cameras and a very easy user interface. Only issue I've seen is that the cameras take a few seconds to start recording, so I've had the occasional recording of nothing because an animal or something went quickly by the screen. However, I have the original Arlo wireless cameras, so I don't know if that's an issue with their newer products. The Geofencing tool is extremely useful as it allows your phone to arm your system based on where you are.",4,1,lifestyle

When I connect directly to your website, it times out before connecting. I think product is defective.",2,1,lifestyle

It randomly stops working if put it on ""speaker"" so you can listen to the baby when you're doing something else on the phone.

The app just need some glitches fixed.",2,0,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,* Latest firmware update rendered Alexa interface unusable. Arlo cameras display an image now they do not stream video to Alexa shows.

com.arlo.app,"Generally a decent app but... I'm not sure which genius at Arlo app development thought it would be a good idea to make the signal for the camera reconnecting to the internet a flashing light because it would have to be the the dumbest design flaw I've ever seen, all it seems to do is wake my child up in the middle of the night.

If you got to Arlo's forum you'll see plenty of people with the same problem.",1,10,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,The app was working fine before last update with zero problems. I've had the Pro 2 system for over 6 months and it's been great.

Have a strong wifi signal in area Arlo is placed but it will disconnect in the middle of the night at times. App functionality is weak (sometimes the fullscreen icon is present, sometimes it's not. Sometimes the screen will rotate with turning your device, sometimes it won't) Customer support is awful. I've had an open ticket for a month and a half. 0 stars!",1,19,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,"Good companion app to Arlo cameras. Could be improved with a snooze function that turns system off for a preset period, like when mowing the lawn. The only options are to put up with the constant alerts (which are annoying and put a drain on the system) or disarm the system. I've done the latter and discover days later I forgot to turn it back on. Additionally, I have a Gen 1 camera that has *never* updated firmware successfully. Would be nice if the app had debugging info or kept a log.",3,2,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,We have had Arlo for over a year now. For awhile we had several issues with it coming up very slow but in the last few months it's working great. The fingerprint is a great option and the site comes up very quickly now. The cameras have always worked well in alerting you of any kind of movement outside. We are pleased with Arlo. I would have given it a 5 if we hadn't had issues the first several months after installing.,4,0,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,App does not flow the way it should. Very difficult to remove the scheduled times of activation. While easy to add the other times of activation; the times they had preset are the exact times I don't need it and could not find how to remove. It is not at all intuitive in the way you move through the app. Need to go through many processes to get to the various items you need and they don't seem to be logical in their flow.,3,1,lifestyle

It won't show ANY downloaded videos and no longer notifies me properly. So I get an alert of motion, yet cant view it. It also very often crashes and logs me out right as I'm checking an alert!!

That seems like a significant flaw.",3,3,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,It was easy to install even for someone like me who is slow to take up new technology. The small issue is the maybe couple of seconds delay in capturing movement. I haven't gone for subscribing to upgraded pack so the camera captures any movement including insects buzzing. The two way voice can also be a good detterent and handy to keep an eye on loved ones.,4,0,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,Very happy with the battery life. Of course batteries will not last when in constant use when you keep it on live picture. Motion notification on my phone is all I need to see when their's activity around. Picture quality is great and can pick out what I need . After 5 months my phone was alerted to motion on cameras and found two people snooping in my car that was left unlocked. I was able to get to my vehicle before anything was taking. Cameras already paid for themselves,5,1,lifestyle

I do not hear my baby waking up and crying in the morning through the app. Will need to switch to another monitor. I use the app for my Arlo Baby monitor.

They had me move the camera from outside to inside next to the base unit and I received notification in just over 3 seconds. They said that was normal.",1,9,lifestyle
com.arlo.app,My biggest thing is the number of times I have to open the app in order to have all the features to be available. I open the app but I'm not able to make it full screen. I open the app again and the temperature isn't showing up. I probably have to open and close it numerous times so it will work properly. The camera will disconnect from the internet randomly.
