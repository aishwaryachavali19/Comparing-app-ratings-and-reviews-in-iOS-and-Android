0	com.herzick.houseparty	social	4	I like it so far! It is a great app to use during social distancing for sure! It keeps you connected to friends and family that lives outside of your home. I would like to see more games if possible and filters fun ones as well as ones that make you look better when you get an unexpected request and you're a mess! Lmao😂 Thank you to the developers of this app! Great job and what great timing!!!	{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.592, 'pos': 0.369, 'compound': 0.9898}

It doesn't need to use my camera when I'm not engaged in any actives, and just changing settings and adding friends. 😡 And for others, it's a privacy concern when an app is constantly turning on the camera for use. For me it's obvious, but for many people, they wouldn't even know... and the app could be watching.	{'neg': 0.039, 'neu': 0.894, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': 0.3551}
2	com.herzick.houseparty	social	3	This is a great app, great concept, my only complaint is that if you want to be with more than 2 people in the call, the app starts to freeze for everybody especially during games.

3	com.herzick.houseparty	social	4	It is a very useful and wonderful app over all but I just wanted to write about something that could be useful to many people including myself along with the app. I think that there should be an update to allow more people in a room at once. I know personally I would like to talk to more then 8 friends at once so maybe it could be possible to allow more people in the room. Like I said it's an overall great app that is just what I would like to see in the future.	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.722, 'pos': 0.278, 'compound': 0.9862}
4	com.herzick.houseparty	social	3	Certain parts of this are great, the concept and ease at which it allows you to just hop on and hang out with friends, the games as well. But it's very under developed. Quizzes get quite repetitive, the settings menu isn't anywhere near fleshed out enough for a calling app and the UI isn't great. I urge the developer to do all they can to capitalise on its new found popularity because this app could be a staple going forward if it's worked on. Also I've had absolutely no privacy concerns	{'neg': 0.1, 'neu': 0.772, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': -0.0052}

6	com.herzick.houseparty	social	4	Great. Very reminiscent of Skype on computers back in the day with the addition of games that can be played by all people participating in the call. We did notice a glitch that happened about two and a half hours into a call. Pretty much everyone's camera started flickering. A few people's cameras turned pink. Only way we were able to Force stop the app and clear our caches. Not all that bothersome, really. Not even sure if it was a problem with the program lol	{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.761, 'pos': 0.169, 'compound': 0.8731}

But even when I turn the volume all the way down on my phone, set to silent mode, I still get the voices of everyone in the call. This is fine if you are alone, but if me and my wife both want to get in on the house party on different phones, it causes horrible horrible feedback loops.	{'neg': 0.126, 'neu': 0.722, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': 0.1386}
8	com.herzick.houseparty	social	2	Cool app to play simple games with friends or family. The problem is that when you connect to the app, it sends an notification to all your friends with this game. If you're on the app then they can just enter without you accepting anything. The worse thing is not that it takes decisions for you but the fact that there's not even permanent settings to stop people from entering your personal space.	{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': -0.2124}
9	com.herzick.houseparty	social	5	I don't rate apps a lot, but I really enjoy this one. It makes me feel much closer to my friends. I'd like to see more games in the future but I get the feeling it's fairly new. It drains battery but I mean what do you expect, it's a group video chat app. I haven't encountered any bugs, and it seems to work pretty well, functionality wise. The UI I feel could use a little tweaking but that's a very minor gripe. I'd also like to see a share screen mode for sharing memes Fun app, 5*	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.689, 'pos': 0.311, 'compound': 0.9907}

11	com.herzick.houseparty	social	2	Confusing interface, and somehow you wind up on a call with someone without touching anything. Also, the sound the notifications make whenever someone is calling or saying hi or whatever it is, is the most annoying, high pitched whistling sound ever. It should never be considered as a sound to use for any kind of notification. It's made me jump out of my seat on several occasions.	{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.93, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.5984}
12	com.herzick.houseparty	social	1	Sadly our first Houseparty experience was an embarrassing failure - riven with bugs and limited user controls, this app is not ready for the market. It was for my wife’s 60th birthday – so kinda important to us. So my sons and I had trialled it three times. All worked well. But the actual function did not go well. After some false starts, I got everyone together and initiated a trivia quiz – only for the questions to disappear from the screen. What followed was a very frustrating half an hour where after a gap, answers would pop up on the screen with 4 x red crosses, then disappear then another answer in 30 seconds or so and so on. This experience was shared by all our guests. There was no way to intervene and so we waited for the quiz to finish but it never did. At the end of the game, unbidden, it rolled into another and so on. We tried logging out and back in – no better. In the end, very frustrated we resorted to Zoom.	{'neg': 0.15, 'neu': 0.82, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': -0.9685}
13	com.herzick.houseparty	social	5	This app is a very good app for friends and family. What makes the app special is that you can play games while you are on a call. I do think that they should add more game options like UNO or even a board game. My one thing is about my privacy. The app is not encrypted which is interesting. Most apps already have encryption buit in. Sure you can lock the room but I feel like that's not enough. Overall, I didn't have any issues or bugs. Very good and creative app.	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.231, 'compound': 0.9677}

15	com.herzick.houseparty	social	3	Great concept We had a lot of fun AT FIRST (and this is in a one night time frame) then everything started to repeat. There wasnt enough variety to make this lasting fun. I even noticed in the trivia that one of the answers was wrong. Could have been more, but one for a fact. The question was on the Harry Potter trivia. Who was Marge's sibiling? Well that would have been Mr. Dursley, but they said the answer was Mrs. Dursley. Wrong! Mrs. Dursleys sibling was in fact Lily Potter, not Marge.	{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': 0.3802}

17	com.herzick.houseparty	social	5	Works great on mobile! Everything working as it should be and the call quality is generally better than alternatives.

Maybe I hadn't figured out the app entirely with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A, but when playing Chips and Guac the card descriptions are cut off and the cards themselves are extriemely small so they only take up about the length of my thumb. The start and stopping of games or the judge not being in the game has also been an issue with how me and a couple of friends delt with the app.	{'neg': 0.094, 'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.194}

Its just basic video calling with games like draw.io so when you can just use a better version of video chatting like instagram or skype its pretty useless.	{'neg': 0.12, 'neu': 0.68, 'pos': 0.2, 'compound': 0.7787}

Currently we have option to add contacts to the existing group but not to remove a contact. 2. If a group call is on and we need to have comment from a person not in the group, there should be a provision to call a person & join in the group discussion for that time only and not permantly adding in the group.	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.947, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': 0.5106}

This has been tested on a Pixel 2 XL, Pixel 3A XL and Pixel 4 XL. It worked one time (speakerphone engagement) with a Pixel 4 XL when a disconnect and a reconnect was done, but not at any of the other times that it was tested. Please sort this bug out. Thank you.	{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.137, 'compound': 0.8689}

That is really messed up in my opinion! The people of this app need to really improve their app Literally! It has good quality pictures, but needs a lot of improvements.	{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.4086}
172	com.google.android.apps.tachyon	social	3	Great call quality. Not a problem with that. My biggest problem is that it takes up TONS of data EVEN WHEN YOU'RE ON WIFI. I realize you can turn your data off, but still. I think that's a poor feature, I ran out of data a couple of times before I realized Duo was using my data. Other than that it's great.	{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.783, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.5898}
173	com.google.android.apps.tachyon	social	3	So this app is not that bad! Pretty cool idea and all, but unfortunately Duo literally drains your battery completely! And the phone call quality isn't that great, but at the same time, FaceTime isn't that great either. Overall, I'd say this is a good app, but not the greatest. Would love to see some improvements in quality.	{'neg': 0.228, 'neu': 0.578, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': -0.5799}

We have been able to use Duo without problems, it is so easy. But just try to get a doctor's office to make life simple and just call us on Duo ... No they want you to use some new untested app, or their own in-house face to face that is built into their system.

However there are no options to do anything once in a call (no camera on/off button, no add people to the call) the only way to add people into the call is to create a group and then call afterwards.

However, the design choice of showing images to post (such as to a comment) strictly in a single stream makes it maddeningly impossible to find things when you've got a large number of images and photos arranged into different folders in the Gallery.

383	com.facebook.katana	social	1	"April 2020 Update: Well, as of a few months ago, I'm finally able to open up my photo via my home feed and/or news feed without it ""freezing"" anymore. Now there is a new issue. I can see some of my pictures in an album with 80ish photos. I could scroll down maybe roughly 15 pictures then i get the spinning icon letting me know it's trying to load the next pictures, but it's really not. I have tried to test this on other android phones I have and they're at acting the same way. Now I try to look at the album using my iPhone and that works just fine. I'm leaning more and more towards iPhone now just because of how buggy these android apps are and bloatwares. Another thing, Facebook's new algorithm on who it thinks should see your posts is terrible. Only a fraction of my friends and family are seeing my posts now because your algorithm doesn't want to ""spam"" people with posts it thinks people wont want to see; meaning my posts. THENNNN you guys shove a bunch of paid ads into our faces instead?? 2019 Reveiw: After digging deep into the phone clearing out so much data and cached files, testing it with other phones, and etc, I have finally found the answer.. It was the Android Facebook update. Clicking a picture from my news feed that has multiple pictures kind of freezes the app. You can press the back button on the Android phone to unfreeze it. The average person that clicks on my picture via their home feed would probably think their app is frozen and close it out then open up again then wouldn't see my new posts with my travel pics anymore on their news feed since it was already shown on their feed.

And the square chat box was perfect, it's what made discord unique.. besides having servers... love how you're keeping up to date but brain storm a little more and come up with some awesome designs. I believe in you guys :)	{'neg': 0.059, 'neu': 0.635, 'pos': 0.306, 'compound': 0.9855}

Right now, messages arent going through to each other and now if we restart/rejoin the call it's not picking up my voice except for the sound of me snapping	{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.075, 'compound': 0.1655}
437	com.discord	social	3	Discord is a really good way to communicate with friends, and if you're an artist it's a great way to talk to commissioners without the need to share a phone number ^^ The most recent update has unfortunately made the app feel really clunky though-- the icons are way too big and buttons take up too much space. Mobile Discord also lacks the spoilers feature which allows you to mark images with a warning, and pictures that desktop Discord users spoiler are shown automatically in mobile.	{'neg': 0.125, 'neu': 0.739, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.2484}
438	com.discord	social	3	"Still the best messaging app out there, but as of the most recent updates, two huge hindrances have been added. 1- The ""links are spoopy"" message. It's a good feature to have, but having no option to disable it is an issue 2- The new UI! There are now unnecessarily two add image buttons, which take up space and lend themselves to being clicked by mistake. Moreover, they now disappear when a message is being typed so it takes an extra click to add an image after you've started typing."	{'neg': 0.081, 'neu': 0.824, 'pos': 0.095, 'compound': 0.3489}

Firstly the way you send media now is pointlessly annoying and overly complicated and second the new context/details menu for messages is wayyy oversimplified and you can't see what text you're trying to react or copy now. The main reason I liked being able to see the text is you could see the emoji name to see what it was. But no	{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.89, 'pos': 0.036, 'compound': -0.4595}

It's like I'm still on call but I can't hear them anymore so I have to keep rejoining the call. Hope this bug gets fixed because it is a little inconvenient.

In the application, whenever I adjust the volume or completely mute bots like groovy and sometimes for other people in the voice channel, the settings reset when I reconnect to the voice channel.

One of the reasons Discord is so useful is due to the simple layout. On mobile, you have changed the typing area. This is far too uncomfortable.

They'd be in a call and I'd try to join. I can acess the call perfectly fine, but then after a few seconds the app crashes and instantly sends me back to my home screen and out of the app. It stopped for awhile, but today I was trying to listen to music on the bots, but it would send me out of the app again or just not let me hear any audio at all.

489	com.discord	social	4	Great app for coordination and talking while gaming. 1 feature I feel is needed is that it should register as an active app so the screen doesn't enter sleep mode, maybe even a dark screen with a circle showing your voice input activity like it does minimized, would work great for push to talk if you could enter a full screen mode like that 🤔 Otherwise, brilliant app, only loose connection when my phone goes to sleep after 30 minutes ☹️😅	{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.744, 'pos': 0.212, 'compound': 0.9552}

That causes a lot of problem esp when u buy a new device and want the old messages also to be seen there esp when using galaxy and iPhone in different situations.	{'neg': 0.047, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.3919}
598	com.whatsapp	social	2	There's should be alot more good details it's missing, like message editing, Public Backround image, Voice changer recording like alien voices, photo stickers, another more specific is Busy tag mode! for only emergency interrupting communication, you won't receive interrupting calls nor messages without blocking, Great ideas!

599	com.whatsapp	social	3	It is good to contact with people but can I ask an update for certain things like can you make a button to rotate or crop a video. It is because an android phone doesn't have that button when we send a video and a video needed to be rotate or crop. We need to install another app to rotate or crop it which is such a waste of time and troublesome. While iphone they have thay button so I really hope you hear my opinion to improve this application ❤️❤️	{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.78, 'pos': 0.147, 'compound': 0.8039}
600	com.popshow.yolo	social	1	Awful, I love being able to ask and answer questions, but after some time, it stopped working. When i would want to answer a Yolo, it would crash and tell me Snapchat wanted to open another app, then take me to the app store where I would have to open it myself, even then, it would only take me to my responses and I wouldn't be able to reply to my friends. Contacted Snapchat support not once, not twice but three times only to have been denied by a bot. This is ridiculous!	{'neg': 0.136, 'neu': 0.737, 'pos': 0.128, 'compound': -0.2244}
601	com.popshow.yolo	social	3	It's pretty fun to see all the comments I get from yolo that i would get the chance to see otherwise but when i get a message i cant see it for a couple minutes which is frustrating. Also there should be a feature where you can flag a comment and it can get reviewed within 72 hours or something and if its deemed inappropriate you can see who said it. I know it kinda ruins the anonymous feature but people would be less likely to say horrible things to you.	{'neg': 0.116, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': -0.8276}

608	com.popshow.yolo	social	5	It is a bit slow to load but i love it. I reccomend it to all peoppe who use Snapchat! It only works for Snapchat thought unless you screenshot it which is hars for some people. But overall i rate this 5 of 5! I like the color change, randomize, history, and bitmogi changes. They are all useful for a mood. I lole how you can also move it around your picture screen like its a sticker lr something. I think a color wheel instead of clicking to change would make the app better though. 5/5 star!!!!!!	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.813, 'pos': 0.187, 'compound': 0.9725}
609	com.popshow.yolo	social	4	Overall it's a good app and I frequently used it. One thing that would make the app better would be to be able to link the URLs to old pictures saved to snapchat instead of having to take a new picture everytime. This would make the app better because often people have photos saved to their camera roll that look ten times better then a quick flick. This will also generate more productivity within the app because the better picture that someone takes, the more responses the user will generate.	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.805, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.959}

You end up losing more times than what would naturally be possible. I noticed that nothing happens by chance because you can clearly see how each card has a follow up that WILL be detrimental to the next person. The only way that you can actually win is if you have power cards to make the other people collect cards. Which means that the player's hand is predetermined by the game.	{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.142, 'compound': 0.802}

The only downside which many people continously point out is the ads you receive after every completed action. It gets to be to much. I understand that the ads are what making the game free but I would rather deal with in app purchases then having the game pause every 30 seconds to run a ad.

It's a widespread issue and I'm patiently waiting for it to be fixed, but it's starting to get annoying. Fantastic game, been playing it since release and still have a Snorlax from 2016. Get it and enjoy it if you have an older Samsung, but avoid at all costs on an S20. I'll put a 5 star back on once I can play again :)	{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.742, 'pos': 0.198, 'compound': 0.9408}

Every now and then I luck in early and slide past them. I would.happily have enjoyed this game, semi regularly spending money on it.

You have to wait until the next day's bonus, fish feeding etc. It's difficult to win enough levels and therefore money to keep the game going. It's difficult to win bombs or lightning. When you do win a level the money reward isn't that great. It would be better if you could gradually build up money or diamonds by playing frequently, rather than being pushed to spend money.

1736	com.wb.headsup	games	2	Not user friendly. I cannot find settings located anywhere so I'm unable to extend the time. It's marketed as family friendly but kids are much slower than adults and get upset when they can only get 1-2 answers in a minute. With no option to extend the timer etc and then paying for content which is beyond even my years (the karaoke category has songs older than me and I'm 30 with nothing current!), my kids got turned off rather quickly because it seemed they were too young to play!	{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.092, 'compound': -0.2495}

1875	com.panteon.homesweethome	games	1	Too many ads. I spent more time watching ads than playing the game. It not only kills the flow, but is really irritating knowing that exposing me to more ads is so much more important than enjoying the game. I value my time more than that. Ways to fix: 1. Cut the ads down to (at mininum) only once after restoring a room, not after each step. 2. Stop making the third option only available after watching an extra video. This is way more reasonable as it could be a good game if I could play it.	{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.698, 'pos': 0.199, 'compound': 0.8926}
1876	com.panteon.homesweethome	games	1	Originally wrote about the ads composing more time in the game than the game, but everyone else is saying as much, so let me talk numbers to the devs instead. I played about 10 minutes. You got 12 ads out of me. I got 4 minutes of actual gameplay. I will not play anymore. I will play games like this for an hour or two a day if there are just ads at the end of each level. Given even 1 hour, that'd be probably 30 ads. 12 once vs 30 daily. Do the math. Cut back the ads. You'll make more money.	{'neg': 0.046, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.6423}

The rip off is so obvious its ridiculous. Play and have fun, but don't spend. Your money becomes worthless.	{'neg': 0.206, 'neu': 0.607, 'pos': 0.187, 'compound': -0.1535}
1926	com.moonactive.coinmaster	games	2	I had given this game 5 stars a while back. I have changed my ratings because I have had 1000's of spins taken from me on the contests. It freezes up I then lose my spins as well. Can't pick revenge because guess what? Guessed it, it won't let me, it freezes and takes my coins and spins as well. I contacted them they gave me a few coins not even close to what I've lost and zero spins and I have sent pictures several attached showing several times with different people what it had done.	{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.068, 'compound': 0.1965}

That's great, but it doesn't tell me what card they're in need of or searching for. I don't want to dump needless cards to them.

You use your coins to buy upgrades in your villages. Once complete you can move on the next village. There are pets later on, and a card collection. The graphics are cute.

Only thing is I wish when I meet goals and get the gift boxes the coin amount would be higher.

I also enjoyed the old board versus the slot style. It is almost like it was set back more for children now. It still is fin I just don't understand why you should get coins for every spin even when the wheel doesn't match.

If you have Samsung you can access the app from Samsung Health, and you can access music stories and free medicating classes on YouTube or other sites on any other phone. This is a waste of time! They might as well make people pay for the app! You could literally listen to everything in a day of 2. Overall I am very disappointed, this is a scam.

HUH? We pay the same as Iphone users who DO have this important feature. So basically what you're paying for is a coach and color-coded food program.

Still, I like the approach and wanted to try it again. I was even planning to pay. Well, I can't log recipes. I can't sync my fitness pal (but iOS users can) to do the logging on. It's hard to find my food log and the step counter is just plain not working at all. They charged me $170.

It is behavior adjustment and you get great information about nutrition and other ""psych"" tricks to get a grip on food addiction.

Plus it's easy to edit your fasts if you forget to hit start or stop. I do kinda wish you could schedule a fast to start in advance also, but the fast reminders work well enough. The place that I think this app lacks though, is integration with other devices and apps. Yeah, it can sync to GoogleFit, but that's pretty limiting. I'd love to see it able to sync to other popular fitness apps and devices like FitBit and Nokia. And that's the only reason I'm taking one star off. Everything else with the app seems exccellent so far. Even the learn section is helpful. Oh, and out of the many fasting apps I've tried (I've tried so many) this is the only one I've found that's free AND doesn't have ads popping up all over. I was just looking for an app I could pay once to get rid of ads and this so far has blown my hopes out of the water. At least I hope, it's been 4 days so far and no ads yet, but another fasting app I used was similiar until a few days in and all of a sudden ads were everywhere and it made the app too annoying to use. And the only way to rid them was to pay a subscription. I deleted that app. So if that happens with Zero I will update my reveiw, but so far it seems great. My one request Zero developers (besides adding devices to sync with), is if you ever go a paid model, please don't go subscription. There's too many sub services out there these days and I refuse to add any more to my month expenses, especially for something as simple for a fasting app. But I would be happy to pay once to buy the app.	{'neg': 0.043, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.166, 'compound': 0.9946}

First the app would crash anytime I tried to upload or view an activity, then the website was down and nothing recorded, now my calorie balance won't update. Tried updating the app, force closing, turning phone off and on. What am I doing wrong?	{'neg': 0.114, 'neu': 0.863, 'pos': 0.023, 'compound': -0.8131}

Ever since the update I can't sync. I've done a ton of trouble shooting. I've hard reset it about 10times, cleared cache, uninstalled/reinstalled app and nothing! I was almost late for work (essential employee) because the time is wrong! Please help!! Everything was working fine until the update!

Not even 3 months old and it's fit for the bin. But support won't admit there is anything wrong with it. It's 2am and my watch thinks it's 7pm yesterday. And it hasn't and wont sync unless I add a new device now that doesn't work since new update. UPDATE: I have done everything you suggested several times, I have even reset my tracker and my phone to original factory settings and still the tracker will not sync with my phone. My phone can see the charge 3 but the charge 3 will not communicate with my phone, it is a useless piece of junk. I have been doing some research online and I have seen that this has been an issue with the charge 3 since 2018. Yet support were blaming my phone and my version of Android. It worked fine on my phone for 2 and a half months until you brought out an update to your software and the three since then have still not fixed it.

My recent story got a picture of a seagull. You can also favorite stories. You can go back and edit things.

I don't have to look at a blank page. Thank you Reflectly. Ive felt better ever since I downloaded this app. 11/10.

However, when it asks what made the day either bad or good, can we please select multiple icons? I've found I can only add multiple icons (relationship, friends, work) if I go back to the entry and manually edit. It's a bit annoying.	{'neg': 0.073, 'neu': 0.722, 'pos': 0.205, 'compound': 0.8779}
2712	com.reflectlyApp	health_and_fitness	5	This app has no ads, and makes all of its revenue off of its premium version. I personally don't have the premium version, but I'm fine because they dont cram premium into your face, asking you to buy it all the time. They ask once, and once only, and later if you change your mind you can buy it. The normal version isn't very restricting, in fact I find it perfect for me. It's my own personal journal entry app, and I kind of use it to not only look on what the future might bring, but my past.	{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.888, 'pos': 0.097, 'compound': 0.8674}

It has helped me reflect and analyze my thoughts providing questions everyday, a morning moment to give you a quote, and also lets you share pictures. I find it rather minimalistic and flexible also because of the themes given. Dark and White theme along with colors.

Also when it asks how I felt throughout the day can you add other because I'm not necessarily feeling any of those.

I thought this was going to be almost like a journal where I could write down what I'm feeling, like log that your anxious and stressed but don't know why, then it would pop up like hey, this causes this, but no. You can log one thing at a time, you don't write anything, the questions you ask are so basic. How was your day choose one. Why? Choose one.

2748	com.reflectlyApp	health_and_fitness	4	Its a really good app and I really reccomend it for students, after all of their stress they go through in school, but genuinely just for anyone suffering with stress, anxiety, depression and need to reflect on themselves. But I would have given this 5 stars if they didnt have to make things premium, it would be much for people who might struggle with financial problems if you just made it so you could maybe level up and earn new parts/chapters of this app. Overall it is a good app so try it!	{'neg': 0.208, 'neu': 0.74, 'pos': 0.052, 'compound': -0.9565}

It does exactly that! It's a great way to visualise your mood and it has plenty of daily questions to help think about the bigger picture. The only disappointments are that I thought the app contained an AI that learnt your mood patterns, and I do not recieve a notification on my device for the daily morning motivation messages.

I've done so many 5k's during quarantine, and half of them haven't counted toward the challenge because the app has frozen. I have to rely on my Fitbit to track me instead.

I've taken hundreds of trips and all over the country. I'd say 85 prevent of the time the drivers speak good English and arrive timely in a clean car and drive to my destination effortlessly. If a car is filthy then Uber needs to know. They have a zero tolerance for any driver using drugs or I've the influence.

It won't allow deletion of payment info, as they initially tell you -- you have to add other payment info before you delete the first. Why? Deleting your account takes up to 60 days. Agents are not provided articles to assist with Privacy concerns. It takes 60 days to delete an acct. Unbelievable ... Lyft has more rights to my info than law enforcement. Never EVER again.

I find myself in a situation where I was trying to get as close as I can to my place of work. I searched for the city that I was in and wound up somewhere on the countryside 30 miles away further for my job. Didn't know how to properly work the app to cancel my reservations now I'm currently charged with a $94 cancellation fee kind of expensive for an accident and misunderstanding.😒	{'neg': 0.093, 'neu': 0.892, 'pos': 0.015, 'compound': -0.7964}
3426	com.airbnb.android	travel	1	One of the most frustrating apps I've ever used. Daily rates mean nothing as total may be higher for a stay with lower daily rate. When searching for a stay on a map, it would just jump between properties, showing you properties outside of your search area. Worst experience ever.

I love that they make both the renters and the owners submit their personal info (incl. Government ID). It makes you feel more safe. From now on when traveling, I will use Airbnb. So much better than most hotels (if there more than 1 day). The only thing that made me uneasy was the THOUGHT of them having cameras INSIDE.

Now we used money on a car for nothing. Reached out to support who will call back in 24 hours. Can't really use that for anything either.

Two locations that are $65 a night could have $200, but you don't know until several clicks/screens later.

Now they only show the daily rate and after entering your dates you get a rate based on the daily rate instead of the monthly one, which is substantially lower. So if you book based on the daily rate you get overcharged. Please bring back the former booking info for easier navigating info.	{'neg': 0.026, 'neu': 0.877, 'pos': 0.097, 'compound': 0.7787}

Being that CA is shut down due to high numbers of COVID19, I had no cancel my trip which was paid in full ling before CA was shut down. I lost half the cost of a 6 day rental due to no control of my own. I should have received a full refund. That would have been the humane thing to do. I doubt I'll use this business again.

3597	com.google.android.street	travel	2	"My only real use of the Google Street View app, at present, is to submit my spherical panoramas, stiched and edited on my desktop computer, onto Google Maps. This has been done ever since Google disabled Street View submissions from desktop computers, a rather infuriating decision - not everyone uses mobile phones to take panoramas. Anyway, I attempted to take a few panoramas with the app and all have ended in spectacular failiure. It might be a hardware issue with my mobile phone (LG G4), but when taking the panorama, the alignment guides and the already-taken frames drift out of alignment. Eventually you will find that you have covered the full 360 degree rotation on the app, yet in reality you still have another 90 degrees to turn. Practically, this means that every frame is spread apart by a certain distance (albeit corrected in stitching), and a quarter of the panorama is missing! Attempts at covering the tiers above and below will intensify the horror, with one tier rotated 180 degrees from another. The stitching will not repair that, as you can imagine. Needless to say, this behaviour is intolerable and makes panorama-taking entirely impossible. I suspect that either the (very good) image stabilisation system in the camera, or the phone's gyroscopes are meddling with the app's operation. As for viewing panoramas, I noticed that the app had improved slightly since when I last used it for this purpose, with less intrusive ""cards"". It is still much easier on a desktop computer, however. The investigation into whether all phones are genuinely compatible with this app is required, because the LG G4 evidently is not! My old G3, with less hyperactive stabilisation, worked perfectly. It would also be nice to be able to submit my panoramas to Google Maps from my desktop again, instead of sending them to a comparitively inferior device. It seems logical, but I am probably pushing my luck with that."	{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': 0.9458}

The shambolic uploading means that they do not arrive in consecutive order, making it a waste of time to start trying to connect them, and they are imperfectly positioned, which is at least manually adjustable. But this has to be done after they are already on public show. There is no option to publish and link photospheres for testing or private viewing, which is stupid as the first time you try it, and every time it messes up the uploading, your efforts are low-grade public content before you have even had a chance to edit them or improve your technique.

App never changed the truck number in the system. I was unable to return truck.	{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.886, 'pos': 0.048, 'compound': -0.4003}

It was dark, it was not properly lit. There was no customer service pine I could call for the specific location. It had snowed 12+ inches in the last 24 hours and the had plowed the lot towards the trucks so I to dig it out and scrape off the windshield myself. Could barely get the truck out of the lot. Absolute nightmare before I even started moving.	{'neg': 0.063, 'neu': 0.937, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.7597}

Truck pickup took almost an hour due to app issues. The app required photos of damage not already documented but when the 'Add Photo' button was clicked, nothing happened after the first photo was added but the app complained that 'photos are required' so I was caught in an endless loop. What's more is that the owners of the business where I picked up my truck reservation were completely unfamiliar with the app and confessed to never having even opened the app which means U-Haul has missed a golden opportunity to gain feedback from their on-site experts. Furthermore, once I started using the app, the onsite staff were unwilling to assist me since everything done through the app is handled by ""dispatch"" and apparently ""dispatch"" and sites don't / can't communicate. Broken process. My drop off on New Years day (site unstaffed as would be expected) went okay - fortunately, the required photos uploaded without issue. However, another customer attempting to pick up could not get the app to give him an access code to the key lockbox so that he could retrieve his rental truck key.

I was expecting to just drive up to the lot, open my phone with my GPS on, click ""I'm here"" or something like that and get the truck. But in actuality I wasted a whole hour on this app going through a lot of verification steps (take a photo of yourself, take a photo of your driver's license front and back, fill out a bunch of contact info, etc). I couldn't figure out why they needed me to drive to the truck and sit in the car on my phone filling out this complex registration - I would have much rather done that a week before from my warm office when I first reserved the truck than on my phone in the cold on the day of a stressful move. Also as others mentioned, every step of the verification was followed by several minutes of waiting before the app ended up crashing. Upload your photo - wait 5 minutes, then the app crashes! Repeat for the next photo, and the next, and the next. Quite frustrating. Finally I got to the last step called ""Reviewing Application"" which I was never able to get to finish loading. After trying for 15 minutes on that step alone I started calling customer support but I never got through to anyone. They have a ""chat with us"" option in the app, but no one answered. All told, I spent an hour waiting in the cold for this app to work. I ended up having to wait until the hardware store where the truck was at finally opened up and I got a human to help.

When it required me to take a photo of the gas gauge, I couldn't press the button for attaching or taking pictures. It took around 35 minutes of standing next to a truck with my phone just to finally rent it, and all because of this dysfunctional app.	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.956, 'pos': 0.044, 'compound': 0.34}

All I wanted to do today was to use the app to make reservations to have a trailer hitch installed. As far as using the UHAUL app, in my opinion it's technology is very outdated to say the least.

The app disagreed since I had makeup on in my DL photo. Apparently, taking photos outside, at dusk, without makeup was impossible for the app to verify.

Just a word of advise from a frequent traveller, a good rule of thumb is to take a screenshot of the boarding pass, just in case something doesn't work while at the airport, either wifi/data, the app or your phone. And that's just in general, not only for Spirit. Also, Spirit is a low budget airline. If you want luxury, then pay for it. Simple.	{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.058, 'compound': -0.1576}

4002	com.spirit.customerapp	travel	1	The worst app I have ever used. To select your departure and return you have to scroll through dates by 5 days at a time, clicking each time you get to the end of 5 days. To input your birthday you have to scroll through a month at a time; you could select the year but WHY NOT JUST LET ME TYPE THE DATE. To input KTN they only allow numbers... KTN is a 9 digit code which is a mix of letters and numbers, so that invalidates it. Seriously the worst app I've ever used.

As someone with thick thighs and a small chest, I found it mildly insulting that every single character has chicken legs and a thigh gap, the only acception being the single overweight persona in the bunch. The fact that you can adjust the size of your chest and not that of your bottom (nor your legs) only contributes to the unhealthy, stick-thin beauty standards so commonly advertized in western society.	{'neg': 0.147, 'neu': 0.814, 'pos': 0.039, 'compound': -0.8588}

Why can't I be curvy and get about 30% more clothes ( the fashion i actually wear) that you offer the thin body type? Is this a bug? I really hope so.

It links with snapchat so you can send personalized stickers and even make your bitmoji come to life.

It's by far the slowest app on my phone, or that I've used in general really. If you want to do something on it you better have 10 minutes set aside to do it, because it will take that long or longer. Forget about actually being able to download pdfs of your bills to your phone, it wont happen.

I guess they do it in case you are just clearing space on your phone and want to keep the pics, but it can be annoying having to delete them from two different places if you just don't need that screenshot of a cat anymore. :) Overall it's probably better to be safe than sorry as far as pic deleting is concerned, so I'm still happy.	{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.778, 'pos': 0.177, 'compound': 0.9437}

I'm very pleased with the Tmobile app; just from navigating and exploring the app, my opinion has changed to a more positive one of my cell phone service provider. I was once very unhappy with Tmobile and swore that as soon as i finished payimg off our phones (which is why we have a 2 year commitment), that I would switch to another service. But now i believe that theres hope for my family to have good a good experience, and thus relationship, with Tmobile.	{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.19, 'compound': 0.9511}

They have terrible customer service and will put in the wrong information and basically lock you out of your own account. Ive tried resetting my password several times and it still doesnt let me in the app. And when i call them and finally get someone on the phone they cant help me, even the reps at my local store are useless.

There are also occasionally some things that could use some correcting so that is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.

I'm using a pixel phone not a tablet, and make many typing errors. an option to rotate screen to sideways mode would help.

Understandable in that they need to make some money, but locking out isn't helpful. It works best if you also access it from your computer. A downside is that it doesn't go in depth to explain verb conjugation clearly, or at least not in the week I've been using it.

5501	com.duolingo	education	4	"While the app itself is quite nice, I can't give it full marks as it is inferior to the website (that you can also view on your mobile device). The problem is that the app seems to be missing the ""tips"" section of lessons, at least I was unable to spot it, in which case this would be more an issue of UI/UX design. This tips section is really helpful and its lack in the app leaves the user rather helpless when the difficulty ramps up.

You lose a heart if you make a mistake, and can't finish a lesson if you run out. With the paid version you have unlimited hearts in the app. Besides that I think Duolingo is awesome, since it's free and a fun way to learn a language.

5503	com.duolingo	education	5	I'm using it primarily for Hebrew. I'm using it in combination with other language activities and software. In this context Duolingo is very helpful. My most recent discovery is that the higher levels (4 and 5) done using keyboard and not word tiles are turning my vague knowledge into precise knowledge. א or ע? Tet or tav?

5505	com.duolingo	education	3	Duolingo is a great app. The reason I give this 3 stars is because of the heart update.

The adverts are very short which is hardly much of a price to pay for the great quality teaching you are receiving. Duolingo continually pushes you to learn more vocabulary which is very useful in the long run because it gives you the motivation to learn so much more than you ever thought you could. I would 100% recommend this app to people of all ages.	{'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.212, 'compound': 0.9672}

5520	com.duolingo	education	5	I have been using duolingo everyday for around 4 weeks, my Italian has improved noticeably. The lessons are broken into small and quite repetitive sections and this repetition subtly causes longer term retention of the new words. As you work through the lessons previous content is regularly referred to so you dont forget the stuff you learnt earler. I cant wait to go back to Bardelino or Sauze Oulx to try it out for real.	{'neg': 0.066, 'neu': 0.872, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.0934}

Even without paying for plus u still have access to many features. 1 thing I dont like is that they used to have clubs but now have leaderboards. The leaderboards might motivate some people to learn more everyday, but the clubs were much more helpful because u could interact with other learners and play fun games that help u learn the language. Please bring clubs back.	{'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.729, 'pos': 0.256, 'compound': 0.9745}

Students can watch the videos as many times as they need. Thanks for increasing shorts from 5 minutes to 10.	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.182, 'compound': 0.9548}

It gives them the chance to think about what they want to speak about from the prompt,and then to record - and re-record - as many times as they like until they feel like they've done well. I really like the screen sharing beta on google chrome (not the app), which allows a kind of show and tell /visual aid function to their presentation. I also like that the camera shy can cover their faces with stickers or blur the image. I don't like that app crashes a lot and many of my students have complained that they have recorded their videos multiple times, and it doesn't post for unknown reasons.

Even now, I'd gladly buy this app (if it doesn't redirect) for several dollars but I will not buy a subscription or sign up for a free limited time subscription. Think this is the wrong direction/business model...but I'm just one consumer.

If I try to slightly scroll up or down to keep the phone awake, the video resets. I also can't find any way to maximize a video to full screen playback. Meanwhile, in the web based platform, there's no way to share photos with teachers. Really seems like an incomplete platform.	{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.868, 'pos': 0.076, 'compound': 0.4054}

The worst feature of this app is that there is no way to edit or delete posts or comments you make, like in Facebook. So once you up upload a photo, or write a post, it cannot be deleted, spelling mistakes and all. It's a very unforgiving platform. Notification badges within the app also cannot be cleared, even when you swipe down on the notification page, or even tap on them individually.	{'neg': 0.107, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.026, 'compound': -0.7647}

Unlike other apps where you have to subscribe for a full course, this app is completely free and has amazing explaination and visuals as well. The language of the teachers is also easily comprehendible and very clear unlike other apps where the teachers are very confused about what to say. You can find a large amount of study material. It is definitely a must have for all the students and whatever you listen you remember it immediately.	{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.768, 'pos': 0.207, 'compound': 0.9565}

I feel like I can stay on track and have a free tutor outside of my college classes and refresh what I forgot in highschool. The English and grammar lessons are easy to remember and well built, and although the math lectures can be slow, they make it easy to understand the material and focus on harder concepts one at a time. You can work on the go without having to have a computer standing by, or at a PC at home. Perfect for my needs!	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.833, 'pos': 0.167, 'compound': 0.9493}

Estimation (instructions say slide, but in actual it's press) and Spelling (instructions say nothing about how it's going to be done, actual is just fill in the blanks!) 2. Some exercises are drastically harder than others, like Brevity, and I don't see how they would help	{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.855, 'pos': 0.121, 'compound': 0.8378}

And I just recently realized that you can replay the same games each day, each with new words/numbers/information. So if you're trying to achieve a higher score in each area, you can work on that as long as you like. Pretty good stuff.	{'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.203, 'compound': 0.9345}

I love the game that I want to subscribe it but the subscription charge is rather too high (N14,500/year) & there is no offer to aid in the subscription.

Many of the challenges are silly with little instructions, left me looking at the screen wondering what I'm supposed to be doing.. and then you run out of time. Not so much for practice thinking, more like tolerating the extremely little amount of time given. Why is every game on a timer?? Probably because it means less content needs to be created.

6754	com.pinterest	lifestyle	5	I love this app so so much! ❤️ Whenever I need ideas for drawings, a new hair do for school, sleepover ideas, (etc) I can use this app knowing it's a perfect and reliable source! This app is perfect for you if you love being crafty and open to new ideas. Though sometimes on my phone I can't correctly zoom in on a photo unless the visual search pops up and shows me more pins like the one I'm looking at. I wish there was a view only option. I hope more people discover this app because its awesome!	{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.759, 'pos': 0.241, 'compound': 0.9837}
6755	com.pinterest	lifestyle	4	Okay so this is a great app and I enjoy the app alot but recently it's been acting up with the likes and even today it wouldn't even show comments and tries on pins. I had to uninstall and reinstall the app to see if it would fix anything and it fixed the problem with not showing tries and comments and it still wont show likes on tries I did. The ads arnt really a big problem for me it's just the thing with the likes on the tries and if you can fix that, that would be great.	{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.752, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.8251}
6756	com.pinterest	lifestyle	1	It's even pathetic now; as it get slower to load, while I can update the app in merely within seconds!! It's getting irritated while any update available in Google Play Store, Pinterest suddenly starts behaving strangely, like freezing, not updating random photos, saving a pin twice to the same group!!!...so on. Even more irritating is that why app need to force us update while it works normally until arrival of new update? Should I think twice before updating or even installing an app.?	{'neg': 0.157, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.051, 'compound': -0.8812}

6774	com.c2m.frankly	lifestyle	3	Great concept idea, poor execution. Probably would work fine if played side-by-side, but the video chat mode is terrible. Video is never connected and you can't understand your friends because the audio quality is terrible. I wanted a game I could play with friends while in quarantine, but this is just unusable as is.	{'neg': 0.191, 'neu': 0.629, 'pos': 0.18, 'compound': -0.4178}
6775	com.c2m.frankly	lifestyle	1	When my friend first introduced me to the game, it peaked my interest because of the scenarios it sets up for the other opponents and how we'd all get a few good laughs in. And it was a fun way to keep ourselves entertained under the quarantine since we couldn't see much of each other IRL. But now with this latest update with us having to earn coins to unlock the same features of the game that we enjoyed before; disappointment doesn't begin to describe the way I feel about this update	{'neg': 0.042, 'neu': 0.8, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': 0.8462}
6776	com.c2m.frankly	lifestyle	1	"introduced coins where you need to ""earn"" money to get more, became less motivated to play the games. Lots of room for improvement, including making an option to change game duration (was 30 min now 15) , having passcodes for the rooms so random people dont join, having a lobby so it doesnt kick out everyone after one game if you're planning to play multiple rounds, and having other bug fixes like not being able to select the video option after a couple of rounds"	{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': 0.8812}
6777	com.c2m.frankly	lifestyle	1	Started playing this game during the quarantine and it was a fun wah to interact with people using the video chat feature. With the newest update making the game cost coins to unlock game modes the game has become a lot less fun to play.

I had my boyfriend download it so we could play the couples game, and I was also really looking forward to playing the sibling game with my sister. However, today, I update the app and see that now I have to spend coins to unlock these gamemodes. Many of the questions in the free mode aren't suited for the people I want to play with.

I can't imagine how long it'll take me to get options again. Taking all the options but one and only giving 20 coins to start, not even enough for a single other thing, is dumb.

I loved that the creators of the app were supporting self-isolation like that by enabling the video chat feature and still allowing you to play fun games with friends. There are no words for how disappointed I am about this update and it totally forfeits the good will I saw in the app before. It is awful to see how apparently everything is about money nowadays.

Typos in the questions to where sometimes we dont know what the person is asking us. When playing side by side one of us will pick a person, and it will select a whole different person that wasnt picked for the question. Sometimes the video glitches out between me and my friends, or sometimes they cant join me because it never leaves the home screen.

Then I checked reviews and they tell me it wasn't always like this. With the way things are right now, trapped at home, you should definitely reconsider having people buy their entertainment with their friends. It's not a smart, fair, or fun detail.

Now its asking you to pay to play when it was free.Not like the amount makes sense you have to spend 16$ for 800 coins which isn't alot of coins. Before the update me and my friend could all play together and have fun but when every game has coins you pay before playing what's the point. Its not like anyone has the extra money to waste on a game that used to be free during this virus outbreak.

I understand not getting matches, that's just life, but for being one of the top online dating service, they have to either make all profiles equally visible or be more transparent about how their algorithm works.

They wont give you any warning or even an explanation of what rules that you broke. Apparently this is common. Google it	{'neg': 0.13, 'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': -0.7391}

Hue lights can be controlled with the app, but Hue scenes cannot be used. When controlling all the lights in a room, SmartThings controls lights one at a time, setting color and brightness as a separate step, which looks quite nasty. Hue scenes, on the other hand, set all the lights as a single step, which looks way better.	{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.766, 'pos': 0.155, 'compound': 0.7657}

I love the layout and ease of use on Survey Junkie. It is very straightforward & never complicated. Other survey sites can be hard to navigate and overwhelming. The only thing is I noticed others saying they are able to cash out at $5.00? I am only able to cash out at $10. Just curious about that?

We've had occasions where one device can see a live image but another is seeing a hung image even though they're on the same WiFi network. Once occasion was an image of an empty cot which caused a little panic! * It sometimes doesn't stop streaming. I've clicked the disable toggle but there is still sound and images streaming from it, often within the same app. instance on the same device, * Echo. We've had situations where the sound is coming from the app twice with a ~1/2 second delay, * Muting. Sometimes you press the button but sound still comes from it. * Image corruption. Though a device like the Nest Max the image comes through clearly without corruption, but on the Arlo app. there are image artefacts appearing.

I usually hear the baby screaming from across the house before this app receives a notification. Also, camera will randomly report that it is offline.

The freezing worries me because what if something is actually happening one of these days and I'm waiting 10mins for the app to actually open and load my videos. Also takes awhile, same thing, when trying to view live.	{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.1027}

7796	com.arlo.app	lifestyle	3	Been using Arlo for over a year as well as two coworker who own 6+ camera systems. I have a mix of Arlo 2 Pro and Arlo 3 as well as the Arlo flood lights. I haven't used other wireless cloud based systems only traditional hard wire. Few gripes about the app. First thing the Flood light need the toggle Left to Right rather than up and down. When your scrolling your devices page it so super easy to turn the flood lights on by mistake. I have Arlo Smart premium and would like the ability to review the video clip that triggered the alert as an option in addition to going to the live video feed. By the time you see the alert 90% time there is no need to look at live footage. Problem also with if its been to long accessing the app or the playstore updates the app you may be getting alerts that are never pushed and notified. You might go a day or two and at some point wonder why you haven't gotten alerts to find out the app got updated and required a login Lastly I would like to see some functionality added for tamper and siren alerts for USB power. If someone was trying to get behind and camera and unplug thinking it disable the camera (happened to my coworker, daughter thought it turned off the camera) would like to get a alert or set a siren config. Currently you would have no way of knowing if you did not regularly check battery status.	{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.853, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.9616}

It won't show ANY downloaded videos and no longer notifies me properly. So I get an alert of motion, yet cant view it. It also very often crashes and logs me out right as I'm checking an alert!! I have to log back in again - by the time I log in to see who's on my property they've already been there for at least 30-60 seconds!	{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.856, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': -0.4885}

Update: Changed WiFi password and now the Q camera won't work. It shows up on my WiFi router but the Arlo app cannot locate it. Updated to 3 stars. Helpful hints: disconnect power and remove battery when camera malfunctions.

It's SUPER slow to load video, and I have a really fast Internet connection, so the app is obviously the problem. I had a package stolen and the thief was long gone before I could even get the video feed to load to see why the camera tripped.

7851	com.arlo.app	lifestyle	3	The app (and associated hardware) performs pretty well; an important part of our overall security system. However, it has numerous deficiencies and inconsistencies that required us to add different security and camera systems. The Arlo system has far longer delays in triggering alerts to both cellphone and desktop than competitors we've used. The login and download of a video from an alert is painfully and sometimes uselessly slow. Two to five minutes delay is too much.	{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.75, 'pos': 0.158, 'compound': 0.5994}

7853	com.arlo.app	lifestyle	1	Serious lag, will randomly decide to not show a live image, crashes all the time, can't open the app consecutively without shutting it down completely before reopening, takes a while to load up. On paper the Arlo baby monitor and app is good. In reality it's unreliable and low performing. Just hope your camera doesn't decide to stop working as you have to pay to post back and receive a replacement which takes weeks. Or you can't pay even more to have a hastened service.

7855	com.arlo.app	lifestyle	2	Right idea, poor delivery. The app doesn't always update with geofencing. Constantly saying devices are offline. If someone walks past the camera by the time it picks them up and starts recording they are gone. Adjusting the sensitivity means I get flooded with loads of false detections, also picks up windy branches and shadows, very frustrating and not reassuring. On top of all this I am constantly changing the batteries.	{'neg': 0.152, 'neu': 0.848, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': -0.8639}

7860	com.arlo.app	lifestyle	1	Extremely unreliable. Do not plan to use this as a primary baby monitor. It misses a lot of movement. It has an option to stream audio to your phone continuously even if the app is minimized. But it'll lose connection and stop playing audio with no warning at all. I constantly have to close the app and reload it because if I go away and come back it'll say not connected even though I was just looking at the feed 30 seconds ago.

The 3rd rate Arlo developers are still incompetent and this app is still garbage. Update: Wow, the Arlo devs are so hopeless they just continue to make it even worse with every update. Now the scheduling is utterly broken, it's sets random schedules completely different from what you enter, which makes it worthless. Arlo - stop hiring the cheapest, most useless developers.

Once you start trying to set cameras active in different areas at different times it falls down. It looks like you can but it doesn't seem to work. Geofencing is also a problem.
